<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the filing date of Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-206648, filed on Aug. 8, 2003.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an electronic circuit device made by packing a module structure comprising a multi-layer circuit board which connects a semiconductor operating element, semiconductor memory elements, and passive elements thereon into a single package with a packing resin component.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modules using semiconductor integrated circuits have been used not only for small electronic devices such as video cameras and cellular phones but also to control car engines and revolutions of train wheels. Each of such modules builds electronic parts having semiconductor functions and electronic parts having resistance functions on a circuit board to control signals. To increase the reliability, an example of such modules is manufactured by bonding a circuit board in a casing, mounting electronic parts in place on the circuit board and packing thereof with silicone gel which is flexible in a wide temperature range. This example has been well known as a module that can improve the withstand voltage characteristic. However, this kind of module uses a casing. This results in making its size greater. Further, silicone gel takes a lot of time in injection and hardening and is low in heat radiation characteristic. Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-79453 discloses a method of packing a module with a thermosetting resin component. This method packs one side of a circuit board with a thermosetting resin. As the coefficient of thermal expansion of the thermosetting resin component is different from that of the circuit board, the module is apt to warp. Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-135377 discloses a method to make the coefficient of thermal expansion of the thermosetting resin closer to that of the circuit board. However, as this method also packs only one side of the circuit board, the interface between the circuit board and the thermosetting resin component is mostly exposed to the atmosphere and apt to be separated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a method for molding the whole circuit board, Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 09-51056 discloses a method to pack the ceramic multi-layer circuit board with a packing material. This invention is characterized in that the electrode connection section is stepped along the layers of the multi-layer circuit board, but this invention has no means to improve the capability of heat radiation of the module.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 08-78618 discloses a method to improve the capability of heat radiation of the module by using a thermal conductive block. This thermal conductive block for heat radiation is made of aluminum nitride having a high modulus of elasticity. So when exposed to a rapid temperature change such as from −55° C. to 150° C., the packing resin component may have cracks due to thermal stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-291808 discloses a power semiconductor integrated circuit which eliminates separation and cracks in the module by bonding a base material and a heat sink together with an adhesive which is made by dispersing ceramics in a brazing material made of aluminum alloy and copper alloy to have a thermal expansion coefficient which is between those of the base material and the heat sink. However, this integrated circuit is not a module structure which connects a semiconductor operating element, semiconductor memory elements, and passive elements thereon and cannot be used as an electronic circuit device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 06-196614 discloses an invention concerning a lead frame made by bonding a stress relief material whose thermal expansion coefficient is close to that of a semiconductor device to the lead frame. This lead frame is resistant to cracks due to stresses but this invention does not take the heat radiation of the stress relief material into consideration. Further, as this invention tries to make the thermal expansion coefficient of the stress relief material close to that of a semiconductor device, a thermal stress will converge on the interface between the lead frame and the stress relief material, and consequently, the lead frame may separate from the stress relief material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-196513 discloses an invention concerning a compound metallic material of high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion which is made from copper and copper oxide. However, this is not related to a resin packed electronic circuit device which connects a semiconductor operating element, semiconductor memory elements, and passive elements thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-119629 discloses an invention concerning an adhesive resin component mixed up with inorganic filling material that contains 50 to 99.9 parts by weight of silver and 0.1 to 50 parts by weight of copper oxide. This adhesive resin component is used to bond a lead frame to a semiconductor chip. However, this invention does not take the capability of heat radiation and resistance to thermal stresses into consideration.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0026">Recently, control devices of vehicles have been demanded to have high control functions to assure comfortable ride and good mileage of vehicles. Further, they have been demanded to reduce production costs and the number of parts. To meet such demands, control devices have been modularized to combine semiconductor elements, resistors, and capacitors. Recently, however, a machine has been required to house its control device in it to further reduce the number of parts. For example, some approaches have been made to build a control device in a transmission to unify a control device and a machine part. Such a control device is required to overcome the problems below. The first problem is downsizing. The control device must be made smaller to be housed in a limited space in a machine part. The second problem is a warpage. The control device should have a little warpage to be housed in a limited space. The third problem is a resistance to thermal changes. The control device should not cause any separation and cracks and should assure its reliability after a long-period exposure to violent thermal changes near a machine part. The fourth problem is an oil resistance. The control device should be so reliable not to cause any malfunction and part separation even in oily hot environments. The fifth problem is a heat radiation. The control device should have a good heat-radiation ability to keep its temperature below the high temperature limit of a semiconductor element that works in a hot operating environment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0027">After carefully examining the above problems, we inventors have found that a compound metallic material made from copper oxide and at least one metal selected from a set of gold, silver, and copper is low in modulus of elasticity but high in thermal conductivity and high in adhesiveness to a packing material. We made a module structure by bonding a multi-layer circuit board which connects a semiconductor operating element, semiconductor memory elements, and passive elements thereon and a supporting material with this compound metallic material and packing these into a single package by transfer-molding. We have also found that this resulting downsized electronic circuit device having little warpage excels in resistance to thermal changes, resistance to oil, and heat radiation. From the above facts, we have completed this invention. In other words, this invention is characterized in the electronic circuit devices below.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0028">An electronic circuit device of a module structure made by packing a whole multi-layer circuit board which connects a semiconductor operating element, semiconductor memory elements, and passive elements thereon and part of a supporting material on which the multi-layer circuit board is placed into a single package by transfer-molding with a packing resin component; wherein the multi-layer circuit board and the supporting material are bonded together with a compound metallic material made up from copper oxide and at least one metal selected from a set of gold, silver, and copper.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0029">As described above, the electronic circuit device is a single package which packs the whole multi-layer circuit board. This can reduce the size and warpage of the device and makes the device highly resistant to oil. Further as the multi-layer circuit board and the supporting material are bonded to each other with a compound metallic material made from copper oxide and at least one metal selected from a set of gold, silver, and copper, the circuit device excels in heat radiation. The low modulus of elasticity of this compound metallic material relaxes stresses due to a difference of thermal expansions of the supporting material and the multi-layer circuit board, prevents separation thereof, relaxes stresses of the packing material and the compound metallic material, and consequently prevents cracks in the packing material. Further, as this compound metallic material is strongly bonded to the packing material, no separation will occur between the compound metallic material and the packing material.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0054">The multi-layer circuit board in accordance with this invention can be any as long as it has at least four circuit layers on it. The multi-layer circuit board can be one or a combination of boards selected from a set of ceramic multi-layer circuit boards using aluminum as the main board material, glass epoxy circuit boards using glass fiber impregnated with epoxy resin, paper phenol circuit boards using paper impregnated with phenol resin, glass BT resin circuit boards using glass fiber impregnated with bismaleimide triazine resin, polyimide circuit boards using polyimide resin, Teflon (registered trademark) circuit boards using Teflon, and polyphenylene ether circuit boards using polyphenylene ether resin. A ceramic multi-layer circuit board is more preferable. This is because the ceramic multi-layer circuit board has a high thermal conductivity and improves the heat radiation of the electronic circuit device.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0055">The supporting material in accordance with this invention can be any as long as it is a material of high thermal conductivity. A preferable supporting material contains copper as a main ingredient and one or more selected from a set of Fe, P, Zn, Ni, Si, Cr, Sn, and Mg as additional ingredients. This supporting material can be used directly or with its exposed areas covered with an organic film or a metal plating if required for assurance of reliability. Such organic films can be any of polyamideimide, polyimide, epoxy resin, coupling agent, chelating agent and so on. Such metal plates are made by plating with metal including Sn, Au, or Ni in major proportions. Judging from points of cost reduction and reliability of connection, plating with metal including Sn is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0056">The material for packing a circuit board into a single package in accordance with this invention can be any as long as it is a thermosetting resin component that can be molded into a package. The preferable packing material should always contain epoxy resin, hardening agent, hardening accelerator, and inorganic filling material. An epoxy resin composition is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0057">The epoxy resin can be any as long as it contains two or more epoxy groups per molecule. For example, such epoxy resins are o-cresol novolak type epoxy resin, naphthalene type epoxy resin, di-cyclo-penta-diene epoxy resin, brominated epoxy resin, biphenyl type epoxy resin, bisphenol A type epoxy resin, bisphenol F type epoxy resin, and so on. A biphenyl type epoxy resin whose melting viscosity is low is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0058">The hardening agent resin can be any as long as it contains functional groups to harden epoxy resin such as phenolic hydroxyl group, amino group, carboxylic group, and acid anhydride. Such hardening agents are phenol novolak, xylylene type phenol resin, di-cyclo-penta-diene type phenol resin, and cresol phenol novolak. A phenol novolak whose melting viscosity is low is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0059">The inorganic filling material can be any selected from a set of silica, alumina, boron nitride, magnesium hydroxide etc., and magnesium hydroxide Silica is preferable because its mechanical and hardening properties are balanced. Although there are two kinds of silica: fused silica and crystalline silica, fused silica is preferable because its coefficient of thermal expansion is little. The fused silica can have any shape (spherical or granule), but spherical fused silica is preferable because it is more flowable. 95% or more by weight of the inorganic filling material is preferably 0.1 to 100 μm in diameter, and more preferably 2 to 20 μm in diameter. The filling material in this diameter range has a maximum filling factor. Even when the filling material is added to the epoxy resin at a high filling rate, the melting viscosity of the epoxy resin compound remains low. The filling rate of the inorganic filling material is preferably 50% or more by volume of the whole volume of the epoxy resin compound and more preferably 75% or more by volume judging from the coefficient of thermal expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0060">The hardening accelerator can be any as long as it can accelerate hardening of the epoxy resin. Such hardening accelerators can be phosphorous compounds (such as tri-phenyl phosphine, tri-phenyl phosphine, tri-phenyl boron, tetra-phenyl phosphonium, tetra-phenyl borate, butyl-tri-phenyl-phosphonium, and tetra-phenyl borate), imidazole compounds (such as 2-phenyl-4-benzyl-5-hydroxymethyl imidazole, 2-phenyl-4-methyl-5-hydroxymethyl imidazole, and 2-ethyl-4-methyl imidazole), and amine compounds (such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]-undesen-7, di-amino-phenyl methane, di-amino-di-phenyl methane, and tri-ethylene-di-amine).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0061">Besides the above ingredients, the epoxy resin compound can contain mold-releasing agent. Coloring agent, elasticizing agent, auxiliary flame retardant, and so on. Available packing methods are transfer molding, injection molding, potting molding, etc. but the transfer molding is preferable judging from a point of mass productivity. This is because the transfer molding method excels in mass production and reliability. When the above epoxy resin compound is packed by the transfer molding, the molding temperature is between 150° C. and 200° C. (not including 200° C.). At lower than 150° C., the hardening reaction of the epoxy resin is slow and the resulting product is hard to be released from the mold. To improve the mold releasing property of the epoxy resin, the hardening time must be made longer. This reduces the mass productivity. At 200° C. or higher, the hardening reaction advances quickly and its fluidity goes low. Consequently, filling may be incomplete. Therefore, the preferable molding temperature is about 180° C.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0062">The compound metallic material in accordance with this invention can be any as long as it is made from copper oxide and at least one selected from a set of gold, silver, and copper. A set of copper and copper oxide is preferable judging from a point of production cost. The copper oxide can be CuO, Cu<sub>2</sub>O, or both. Cu<sub>2</sub>O is preferable because the compound metallic material using Cu<sub>2</sub>O is better in mechanical characteristics than the compound metallic material using CuO.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0071">The electronic circuit device of Embodiment 1 has a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b> is a 6-layer glass BT resin multi-layer circuit board (50 mm×40 mm). The outermost layer of the board is a copper sheet plated with nickel of 5 μm thick. We prepared the compound metallic material <b>2</b> by mixing silver powder and Cu<sub>2</sub>O powder, cold-pressing the mixture, and sintering it at 950° C. for three hours. The resulting compound metallic material is 50 mm long×40 mm wide×0.7 mm thick containing 70% by volume of silver and 30% by volume of Cu<sub>2</sub>O. We prepared an electronic circuit device by welding the compound metallic material <b>2</b> to an aluminum supporting material (junction <b>6</b>), printing solder (junction <b>5</b>) of 3.5 parts of Ag, 0.3 part of Cu, and 96.2 parts of Sn by weight on the compound metallic material, dispensing silver paste in place on the multi-layer circuit board to mark locations of a bare-chip microcomputer <b>7</b> containing memory, a transistor <b>8</b>, and a diode <b>13</b>, placing the microcomputer <b>7</b>, a transistor <b>8</b>, and a diode <b>13</b> on the locations, hardening the silver paste at 150° C. for one hour for adhesion, heating the microcomputer <b>7</b> containing memory up to 200° C. from the circuit side of the multi-layer circuit board on the heating stage, electrically connecting pats of the microcomputer <b>7</b> and the lands on the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b> with gold wires <b>9</b> by the ultrasonic wire-bonding, dispensing the solder paste of 3.5 parts of Ag, 0.3 part of Cu, and 96.2 parts of Sn by weight as a conductive material <b>10</b> to the lands on the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b>, placing parts such as resistors <b>11</b> and capacitors <b>12</b> on the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b>, placing the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b> on the solder-printed side of an assembly of the supporting material and the compound metallic material <b>2</b>, melting solder (junction <b>5</b>) and the conductive material <b>10</b> at 270° C. by the infrared reflow equipment, solidifying thereof to make electric connections between the electronic parts (resistors <b>11</b> and capacitors <b>12</b>) and the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b>, connecting terminals <b>15</b>, the transistor <b>8</b>, and the diode <b>13</b> to the multi-layer circuit board with Al wires (as wire <b>14</b>) at a room temperature by ultrasonic wire bonding, applying the packaging resin component <b>4</b> which contains 63% by volume of silica filler as an inorganic filling material and gels in 30 seconds at 180° C., and molding the resin component <b>4</b> at a mold temperature of 180° C. and a transfer pressure of 7 MPa for three minutes by a low-pressure transfer-molding. The characteristics of the packaging resin component after hardening are 3 GPa (as the modulus of elasticity at a room temperature), 16 ppm/° C. (as the coefficient of line expansion), and 150° C. (as the glass transition temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0072">We tested this prepared electronic circuit device for warpage, air tightness, moldability, mass productivity, malfunction, separation, and cracks after a thermal shock of 2000 cycles, separation, malfunction, and heat radiation after dipping in oil at 140° C. for 2000 hours. Table 1 lists the result of this test.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0073">To measure the adhesion strength between the compound metallic material and the packaging resin component, we formed a truncated cone of the packaging resin component on the compound metallic material by transfer molding, applied a strain to the truncated cone 50 μm high above the base at a speed of 2 mm/minute by a shearing tool, and got the shearing adhesion strength from a strength at which the truncated cone is broken. We repeated the above using four to five samples and took their average.</p>

The tested electronic circuit device is evaluated to be acceptable (∘) when the warpage is less than 200 μm and not acceptable (×) when the warpage is 200 μm or more. We checked the air tightness of the electronic circuit devices after a thermal shock of 3000 cycles by the dye penetrant testing method (color check) using a penetrant test dye. The tested electronic circuit device is evaluated to be acceptable (∘) when the ink penetration is 1.0 mm or longer, almost acceptable (Δ) when the ink penetration is between 0.5 mm and 1 mm (not including 1 mm), and not acceptable (×) when the ink penetration is shorter than 0.5 mm. The moldability of the circuit device package is evaluated to be acceptable (∘) when the package is made causing no problem in fluidity and mold releasing or not acceptable (×) when the package has any problem in fluidity and mold releasing. We evaluated the mass productivity of the electronic circuit devices by a time period between the beginning of electrical connection of electronic parts on the multi-layer circuit board and the end of packing with resin. The mass productivity is evaluated to be acceptable (∘) when the time period is shorter than 30 minutes or not acceptable (×) when the time period is 30 minutes or longer.</p>

We prepared an electronic circuit device by dispensing thermosetting silver paste in place on the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b> to mark locations of a bare-chip microcomputer <b>7</b> containing memory, a transistor <b>8</b>, and a diode <b>13</b>, placing the quality-assured microcomputer <b>7</b> containing memory, the transistor <b>8</b>, and the diode <b>13</b> on the locations, hardening the silver paste at 150° C. for one hour for adhesion, heating the microcomputer <b>7</b> containing memory up to 200° C. from the circuit side of the multi-layer circuit board on the heating stage, electrically connecting pats of the microcomputer <b>7</b> and the lands on the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b> with gold wires <b>9</b> by the ultrasonic wire-bonding, dispensing a solder paste of 3.5 parts of Ag, 0.3 part of Cu, and 96.2 part of Sn by weight as a conductive material <b>10</b> to the lands on the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b>, placing parts such as resistors <b>11</b> and capacitors <b>12</b> on the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b>, printing a solder paste (solder <b>21</b>) of 3.5 parts of Ag, 0.3 part of Cu, and 96.2 part of Sn by weight on the copper supporting material, placing the multi-layer circuit board on the supporting material, melting the solder (junction <b>5</b>) and the conductive material <b>10</b> at 270° C. by the infrared reflow equipment, solidifying thereof to bond the supporting material <b>3</b> to the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b> and to make electric connections between the electronic parts (resistors <b>11</b> and capacitors <b>12</b>) and the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b>, electrically connecting terminals <b>15</b>, the transistor <b>8</b>, and the diode <b>13</b> to the multi-layer circuit board <b>1</b> with A1 wires (as wire <b>14</b>) at a room temperature by ultrasonic wire bonding, applying the packaging resin component <b>4</b> which contains 80% by volume of silica filler as an inorganic filling material and gels in 30 seconds at 180° C., and molding the resin material at a mold temperature of 180° C. and a transfer pressure of 7 MPa for three minutes by a low-pressure transfer-molding. The characteristics of the packaging resin material after hardening are 3 GPa (as the modulus of elasticity at a room temperature), 8 ppm/° C. (as the coefficient of line expansion), and 120° C. (as the glass transition temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0133">We tested this prepared electronic circuit device for warpage, air tightness, moldability, and mass productivity, malfunction, separation, and cracks after a thermal shock of 2000 cycles, separation, malfunction, and heat radiation after dipping in oil at 140° C. for 2000 hours. Table 1 lists the result of this test.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0134">This electronic circuit device which was prepared above had a separation between the multi-layer circuit board and the supporting material. This is because the solder <b>21</b> was broken by the thermal stresses between the supporting material and the multi-layer circuit board.</p>
