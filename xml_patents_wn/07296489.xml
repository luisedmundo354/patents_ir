<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A starting apparatus includes a drive motor and a reduction gear having a planetary gear for starting an engine by the drive motor via the reduction gear. An internal gear of the reduction gear includes a locking projection projecting in an axial direction. A rotation restricting member is formed with a guide groove in which the locking projection is loosely received and guided in a circumferential direction. A shock absorbing member is held in the guide groove in a state of being elastically in close contact with the locking projection in the circumferential direction. Thus, shock load to the internal gear is alleviated from the start.</p>

The entire disclosure of the prior application is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This application is based on Japanese Patent Applications No. 2002-125979 filed on Apr. 26, 2002, No. 2002-363019 filed on Dec. 13, 2002 and No. 2002-363023 filed on Dec. 13, 2002, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a starting apparatus used to start an engine. More specifically, the present invention relates to a starting apparatus having a reduction gear with a planetary gear.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An internal combustion engine (hereinafter, simply referred to as “engine”) needs to be driven by a starting apparatus (hereinafter, pertinently referred to as “starter”) in starting the engine. As the starting apparatus, there are a gear type starter, a belt type starter and the like all of which are common in that an electric motor constitutes a drive source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In starting the engine, comparatively large torque is required although depending on a kind and a displacement thereof. Therefore, when the engine is cranked directly by the motor, the physical configuration of the motor naturally becomes large. Hence, in a recent starting apparatus requesting light-weighted compact formation, high torque necessary for starting is achieved by interposing a reduction gear between the motor and the engine to thereby increase a speed reducing ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although there are various reduction gears, a planetary gear-type reduction gear, which compactly achieves a large speed reducing ratio, is frequently used. In the planetary-type reduction gear, a driving force inputted from the motor to a sun gear of the reduction gear is outputted from a carrier supporting planetary gears with high torque. In this case, rotation of an internal gear, which meshes with the planetary gears, in the circumferential direction is restricted to achieve a predetermined speed reducing ratio. That is, a large reaction force (torque) produced in accordance with the output needs to be received by the internal gear. Therefore, rotation of the internal gear in the circumferential direction needs to be constrained.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, according to the engine, torque necessary for rotation is rapidly varied by strokes of intake, compression and the like and an engine rotation speed is also pulsated. The motor of the starter cannot well follow such a load variation or the like and therefore, impact load is applied between the internal gear and a rotation restricting portion thereof. Further, the reaction force applied to the internal gear is not constant. As a result, unpleasant sound is likely to be caused in starting the engine due to vibration or the like of the internal gear by simply constraining the internal gear.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the internal gear is rigidly restricted here, it is required to reinforce the internal gear or the restricting portion to be able to withstand the shock load, which hampers light-weighted compact formation of the starter. Hence, in order to alleviate the shock load applied to the internal gear and the like, a shock absorbing member including an elastic body made of such as rubber is provided between the internal gear and the rotation restricting portion. These are proposed in, for example, JP-Y2-2-31581, JP-Y2-2-31583, JP-B2-4-40549 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,316), and JP-A-5-52166 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,323,663).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, according to JP-Y2-2-31581, JP-Y2-2-31588 and JP-B2-4-40549, the shock absorbing member is for example provided on an outer peripheral side of an internal gear. However, an outer diameter of a reduction gear is increased thereby and compact formation of a starter is not achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to JP-A-5-52166, a projection extending from a side face of an internal gear in an axial direction is held by a shock absorbing member (elastic body) and therefore, in this case, a starter is not enlarged in an outer diameter direction. However, the projection of the internal gear is not held elastically by the shock absorbing member from the start. Therefore, shock load is not necessarily alleviated sufficiently from start of operation thereof. Particularly, in the case in which the internal gear and the like are made of synthetic resin in view of light-weighted and low coast formation or the like, when shock load is insufficiently alleviated, reliability of the internal gear and therefore, the starter can be lessened.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in JP-A-5-52166, a friction plate is separately pressed to a pivoting plate engaged with the internal gear and the internal gear is constricted by friction force produced therebetween. Therefore, the structure of the starting apparatus is complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, the shock absorbing member used in JP-A-5-52166 is rubber in a shape of a rectangular parallelepiped and an area thereof in contact with an inner wall of a containing portion thereof is large. Therefore, compression operability of the shock absorbing member is poor and the shock absorbing member is likely to easily wear.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the shock absorbing member only receives reaction force in the circumferential direction of the internal gear. There is not a specific disclosure with regard to supporting the internal gear in an axial direction. In addition, the internal gear is not provided with a detent and therefore, the internal gear continues rotating little by little while the exerted reaction force is large. As a result, efficiency of transmitting driving force of the motor is likely to be lessened.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention has been carried out in view of such a situation and it is an object of the present invention to provide a starting apparatus capable of alleviating shock load applied in accordance with a variation in engine load from the start and achieving compact formation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another object of the present invention to provide a starting apparatus capable of resolving unpleasant sound in starting.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is further another object of the present invention to provide a comparatively simple and efficient starting apparatus with improvements of durability of a shock absorbing member and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According an aspect of the present invention, a starting apparatus includes a drive motor and a reduction gear. The reduction gear includes a sun gear rotated by receiving an input from the drive motor, an internal gear arranged concentrically around the sun gear, a rotation restricting member for restricting free rotation of the internal gear, a shock absorbing member interposed between the internal gear and the rotation restricting member. A carrier rotatably supports a planetary gear meshing with the sun gear and the internal gear and outputs an input of the sun gear by reducing a speed thereof. A driving force from the drive motor is transmitted to an engine via the reduction gear, thereby starting the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The internal gear includes a locking projection projecting from a side face thereof along a rotation axis of the reduction gear. The locking projection is loosely received in a guide groove formed on the rotation restricting member, and guided therein in a circumferential direction. The shock absorbing member is held in the guide groove in a state of being elastically in close contact with circumferential side faces of the locking projection.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the starting apparatus, the locking projection projects in the axial direction from the side face of the internal gear. Therefore, an outer diameter of the reduction gear is not enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The locking projection can be moved in the guide groove of the rotation restricting member in a certain range in accordance with a direction of reaction force or impact load applied to the internal gear from the planetary gear. In this case, the locking projection is elastically supported by the shock absorbing member in the guide groove from both of the sides in the circumferential direction, irrespective of whether reaction force is applied to the internal gear. Thus, the internal gear is in a state of being elastically held from start of operating reaction force. Even when the reaction force or the shock load is released, also the other side face of the locking projection in the circumferential direction is elastically supported by the shock absorbing member. Therefore, it is less likely that rapid load will be operated to the internal gear.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, large shock load to the internal gear is suppressed. Reliability of the starter is ensured even when the internal gear is made of synthetic resin. Further, by alleviating the shock load, unpleasant sound generated in starting the engine is also decreased. Although the shock absorbing member includes a spring or the like, an elastic body comprising rubber or the like is general therefore in consideration of cost, shock absorbing function or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another aspect of the present invention, a starting apparatus includes a drive motor and a reduction gear. The drive motor starts to rotate an engine via the reduction gear. The reduction gear includes a sun gear rotated by receiving an input from the drive motor, an internal gear arranged concentrically with the sun gear on an outer peripheral side of the sun gear, a planetary gear meshing with the sun gear and the internal gear, a carrier rotatably supporting the planetary gear and outputting an input of the sun gear by reducing a speed thereof. The reduction gear further includes a rotation constraining unit for constraining rotation of the internal gear arranged movable in a circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The rotation constraining unit includes a movable locking portion integrated movable with the internal gear in the circumferential direction, an unmovable locking portion arranged in a state opposing to the movable locking portion in the circumferential direction and unmovable in the circumferential direction, and a shock absorbing member including an elastic block portion. The elastic block portion is elastically held at least between the movable locking portion and the unmovable locking portion. The elastic block portion elastically receives a reaction force applied to the internal gear when the drive motor starts to rotate the engine via the reduction gear.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the starting apparatus, the internal gear is restricted from rotating at least in one direction by the rotation constraining unit including the movable locking portion, the unmovable locking portion and the shock absorbing member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In starting the engine, the internal gear receives a reaction force in a direction opposite to an output of the carrier. The reaction force is received by the unmovable locking portion from the movable locking portion integrally moved with the internal gear via the elastic block portion of the shock absorbing member. Thus, the internal gear is restricted from rotating in the direction of the reaction force.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The reaction force is gradually elastically received by the unmovable locking portion. Therefore, it is less likely that shock load will be applied to respective portions and unpleasant sound will be caused by direct contact of locking members. Further, the shock absorbing member also works as a vibration isolating member and therefore, can absorb vibration and sound generated at the reduction gear or a surrounding thereof. In this way, the reduction gear can reduce vibration, unpleasant sound generated in operating the starting apparatus although the reduction gear is provided with a comparatively simple structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a gear-type starter (hereinafter, simply referred to as a starter) <b>1</b>. The starter <b>1</b> mainly includes a reduction gear <b>10</b>, a motor <b>80</b> and a magnet switch <b>90</b>. Although not illustrated in details, an output of the motor <b>80</b> is transmitted to an output shaft that is formed with a helical spline on its outer peripheral face via the reduction gear <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An overrunning clutch (one way clutch) and a pinion gear are arranged on the helical spline. (See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) In starting, the overrunning clutch and the pinion gear are pushed in an axially forward direction (to a left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) by lever operation of the magnet switch <b>90</b>. Further, the pinion gear is temporarily brought in mesh with a ring gear attached to a crankshaft of the engine to thereby crank the engine. When the engine has been started, the pinion gear of the starter <b>1</b> is idly rotated by the overrunning clutch to thereby prevent excessive rotation of the motor <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The reduction gear <b>10</b> has a sun gear <b>11</b>, three planetary gears <b>12</b>, a carrier <b>13</b>, an internal gear <b>14</b>, a shock absorbing member <b>15</b>, and a gear housing (rotation restricting member) <b>18</b>. The sun gear <b>11</b> is formed on or spline-fitted to a motor main shaft <b>811</b> that extends from a rotor <b>81</b> of the motor <b>80</b>. The three planetary gears <b>12</b> are arranged at a surrounding of the sun gear <b>11</b>. The planetary gears <b>12</b> mesh with the sun gear <b>11</b>. The carrier <b>13</b> rotatably and revolvably supports the planetary gears <b>12</b> via a roller bearing <b>122</b> and a pin <b>123</b>. The internal gear <b>14</b> is arranged on outer peripheral sides of the planetary gears <b>12</b>. The internal gear <b>14</b> has internal teeth and meshes with the planetary gears <b>12</b>. The gear housing <b>18</b> covers the outer periphery and an axially front end (left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the internal gear <b>14</b>. The shock absorbing member <b>15</b> is interposed between the internal gear <b>14</b> and the gear housing <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The gear housing <b>18</b> is fixed to a motor housing <b>88</b> that surrounds the motor <b>80</b> at an axially front end of the motor housing <b>88</b>. A cover plate <b>19</b> is provided between the gear housing <b>18</b> and the motor housing <b>88</b> to partition therebetween. The cover plate <b>19</b> is in contact with a rear end face of the internal gear <b>14</b> to thereby also restrict the internal gear <b>14</b> in the axial direction. Further, the internal gear <b>14</b> is made of thermosetting resin.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, an explanation will be given of the internal gear <b>14</b>, the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> and the gear housing <b>18</b> which are characteristic portions of the embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The internal gear <b>14</b> has four locking projections <b>143</b>. Each of the locking projections <b>143</b> projects from an axial front surface of the internal gear <b>14</b> at a slightly inner peripheral side. The locking projections <b>143</b> are arranged at equal intervals in a circumferential direction of the internal gear <b>14</b>. Inner and outer peripheral faces of the locking projection <b>143</b> include circular arc faces. Circumferential faces <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> of the locking projection <b>143</b> lie substantially perpendicular to the circumference of the gear.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The shock absorbing member <b>15</b> is a ring-shaped rubber member. The shock absorbing member <b>15</b> includes locking recessed portions <b>156</b> at an axial rear end face and fixed recessed portions <b>155</b> at an axial front end face. Rubber blocks (elastic blocks) disposed on both sides of the locking recessed portion <b>156</b> constitute a first elastic block portion <b>151</b> and a second elastic block portion <b>152</b>. A portion connecting the first elastic block portion <b>151</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>152</b> on a side opposite to the fixed recessed portion <b>155</b> constitutes a bridging portion <b>153</b>. Further, a small semispherical elastic projection <b>154</b> protrudes from a center of a bottom face of the locking recessed portion <b>156</b> in an axially rear direction. Further, the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> is made of oil resistant rubber (for example, NBR) that is not easily deteriorated even when grease or the like is adhered thereto. The shock absorbing member <b>15</b> is formed by integral molding of rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The gear housing <b>18</b> is a substantially cylindrical member and provided with a through hole <b>183</b> to support an output shaft of the carrier <b>13</b> via a sleeve bearing <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at a center thereof. Guide grooves <b>181</b> having bottomed circular arc shapes are arranged in a ring-like shape at equal intervals in the circumferential direction to surround an outer periphery of the through hole <b>183</b>. Further, the guide grooves <b>181</b> are partitioned with ribs <b>185</b> extending in a radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The respective members are integrated as follows. First, the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> is press-fitted to the guide grooves <b>181</b> of the gear housing <b>18</b>. At this time, the first elastic block portion <b>151</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>152</b> opposing each other by interposing the locking recessed portion <b>156</b> are fitted in the same guide groove <b>181</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the fixed recessed portion <b>155</b> is fitted to the rib <b>185</b> of the gear housing <b>18</b>. In this condition, there is no clearance or play between the gear housing <b>18</b> and the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> in the circumferential direction. Further, the locking projection <b>143</b> of the internal gear <b>14</b> is press-fitted to the locking recessed portion <b>156</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Therefore, circumferential faces of the first elastic block portion <b>151</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>152</b> that are opposed through the locking recessed portion <b>156</b> are in a state of being elastically in close contact with the circumferential faces <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> of the locking projection <b>143</b>. That is, the locking projection <b>143</b> is in a state of being previously pressed by the first elastic block portion <b>151</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> absorbs shock load applied to the internal gear <b>14</b> gradually from start of displacement thereof in the circumferential direction. The behavior is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by a solid line X. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> conceptually shows a relationship between rotational displacement of the internal gear and shock absorbing function of the shock absorbing member. A dotted line Y shows a case in which a shock absorbing member is not in close contact with the locking projection and a clearance (δ) is present between the shock absorbing member and a wall face of a guide groove as in the prior art. In the case of the dotted line Y, shock load is absorbed after an internal gear is displaced by an amount of the clearance. Further, the absorption is considerably rapid by an amount of retarding to absorb shock load. Therefore, it is known that according to the conventional shock absorbing structure, absorption and reduction of the shock load applied to the internal gear are insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the embodiment, the locking projection <b>143</b> extending from the front face of the internal gear <b>14</b> in the axial direction and therefore, the reduction gear <b>10</b> is not enlarged in the outer diameter direction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, the locking projections <b>143</b> can move in the guide grooves <b>181</b> of the rotation restricting member <b>18</b> in a certain range in accordance with a direction of reaction force or impact load applied to the internal gear <b>14</b> from the planetary gears <b>12</b>. The locking projections <b>143</b> are elastically supported at the circumferential faces <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> by the shock absorbing member <b>15</b>, which is held in the guide grooves <b>181</b>, in the circumferential direction, irrespective of whether reaction force is applied to the internal gear <b>14</b>. That is, the internal gear <b>14</b> is elastically held from start of operating reaction force.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, even when the reaction force or the shock load is released, the circumferential faces <b>141</b>, <b>142</b> of the locking projections <b>143</b> are elastically supported by the shock absorbing member <b>15</b>. Therefore, it is less likely that the load will be rapidly applied to the internal gear <b>14</b>. In this way, the internal gear <b>14</b> is restrained from large shock load more than that of the prior art. The internal gear <b>14</b> is firmly protected. As a result, reliability of the starter <b>1</b> is ensured even when the internal gear <b>14</b> is made of synthetic resin. Further, by the alleviation of the shock load, unpleasant sound generated in starting the engine is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Meanwhile, although the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> includes a spring or the like, an elastic body including rubber or the like is general therefore in consideration of cost, shock absorbing function or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although an explanation has been given of shock absorbing operation when force is applied to the internal gear <b>14</b> in the circumferential direction, in consideration of various vibrations applied to the internal gear <b>14</b>, integration tolerance and the like, it is preferable that the internal gear <b>14</b> is elastically held also in the axial direction. Here, the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> has the semispherical elastic projections <b>154</b> projecting in the axial direction. Therefore, the axial end faces of the locking projections <b>143</b> are elastically held by the elastic projections <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, the second embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the second embodiment, a shock absorbing member <b>25</b> has a shape different from the shape of the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> of the first embodiment. Shock load applied to the internal gear <b>14</b> is absorbed by four independent shock absorbing members <b>25</b> each having the same shape.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each of the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> includes a first elastic block portion <b>251</b>, a second elastic block portion <b>252</b> and a bridging portion <b>253</b> for bridging the first elastic portion <b>251</b> and the second elastic portion <b>252</b>. An elastic projection <b>254</b> is formed on the bridging portion <b>253</b> to elastically contact with an axially front end face of the internal gear <b>14</b>. The shock absorbing member <b>25</b> is formed by integral molding of rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The shock absorbing member <b>25</b> is fixed to the gear housing <b>18</b> such that a fixed recessed portion <b>255</b> formed between the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>252</b>, that is, on a front side of the bridging portion <b>253</b> is press-fitted to the rib <b>185</b> partitioning the guide grooves <b>181</b>. Therefore, the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>252</b> of one of the block absorbing members <b>25</b> are respectively held in contiguous ones of the guide grooves <b>181</b>. Further, the locking projection <b>143</b> of the internal gear <b>14</b> is press-fitted between the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> of one shock absorbing member <b>25</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>252</b> of the different shock absorbing member <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Reaction force or shock load applied to the internal gear <b>14</b> is received and absorbed mainly by the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> having a larger rubber volume. At this time, a circumferential face of the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> on a side of the bridging portion <b>253</b> is supported by the rib <b>185</b>, that is, supported by an inner wall of the guide groove <b>181</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, even when the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> is considerably contracted, the bridging portion <b>253</b> is hardly effected by that contraction. That is, different from the case of the shock absorbing member <b>15</b>, the bridging portion <b>253</b> is not stretched by the contraction of the first elastic block portion <b>251</b>. Accordingly, the elastic projection <b>254</b> stably presses the front end face of the internal gear <b>14</b> in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the second embodiment, the first and the second elastic block portions <b>251</b>, <b>252</b> are filled in the guide grooves <b>181</b>. Therefore, the locking projections <b>143</b> are held in a state of being elastically in contact with the shock absorbing member <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a case that there are a plurality of partitioned guide grooves, a large number of steps are required for fitting the elastic members piece by piece. Also, a number of parts is increased. However, the plurality of guide grooves <b>181</b> is arranged at equal intervals in the circumferential direction. Also, the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> is formed such that the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>252</b>, which are respectively fitted in contiguous guide grooves <b>181</b>, are connected by the bridging portion <b>253</b> to span the one guide groove <b>181</b>. Accordingly, the number of parts is reduced. Further, the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> and the second elastic block portion <b>252</b> can be fitted in the guide grooves <b>181</b> in one motion.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, the elastic projection <b>254</b> is provided at the bridging portion <b>253</b> to elastically contact with the front end face of the internal gear <b>14</b>. Since the shock absorbing members <b>25</b> are separate in the circumferential direction, influence by the contraction of the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> or the second elastic block portion <b>252</b> is hardly effected on the bridging portion <b>253</b> due to restriction by the inner wall of the guide groove <b>181</b>. That is, the elastic projection <b>254</b> is not moved in the circumferential direction by being dragged by contraction of the elastic block portions <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>. Thus, the elastic projection <b>254</b> can stably urge the internal gear <b>14</b> in the axial direction. Accordingly, uneven wear or the like of the internal gear <b>14</b> can be effectively restrained. Thus, reliability of the starter <b>1</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, the third embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the third embodiment, the shock absorbing member <b>35</b> includes a first elastic block portion <b>351</b>, a second elastic block portion <b>352</b> and a bridging portion <b>353</b>, similar to the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> of the second embodiment. However, the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> is significantly different from the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> in that a central portion of the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> is slenderly constricted. That is, the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> includes end portions <b>351</b><i>a </i>and <b>351</b><i>b </i>and a constricted portion <b>351</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The end portions <b>351</b><i>a </i>is a portion being in contact with the circumferential face of the locking projection <b>143</b> of the internal gear <b>14</b>. Further, the end portions <b>351</b><i>a </i>and <b>351</b><i>b </i>are fitted in the guide groove <b>181</b> in a state that the inner and outer peripheral walls of the end portions <b>351</b><i>a</i>, <b>351</b><i>b </i>are loosely in contact with inner walls of the guide groove <b>181</b>. That is, the end portions <b>351</b><i>a</i>, <b>351</b><i>b </i>are held in the guide groove <b>181</b> in a loosely press-fitted state. Meanwhile, the constricted portion <b>351</b><i>c </i>is not in contact with either of inner walls of the guide groove <b>181</b> and an air gap is formed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, when reaction force or impact load is operated to the internal gear <b>14</b> and the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> is pressed, the constricted portion <b>351</b><i>c </i>that has small deformation resistance (low rigidity) mainly starts contracting and expanding in the outer peripheral direction. At this time, since the air gap is present between the constricted portion <b>351</b><i>c </i>and the inner wall of the guide groove <b>181</b>, considerable deformation function is manifested by the constricted portion <b>351</b><i>c</i>. Thus, the shock absorbing member <b>35</b> provided shock absorbing function larger than that of the shock absorbing member <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a case in which width of the bridging portion <b>353</b> is expanded in the radial direction more than the bridging portion <b>253</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the guide groove <b>181</b> is excessively filled with the elastic block, deformation resistance of the elastic block portion <b>351</b> is rapidly increased and block absorbing function by the elastic block portion <b>251</b> is reduced. Hence, in order to ensure the deformation resistance of the elastic block portion <b>351</b> in a certain range, a volume of the elastic block portion <b>351</b> is increased when deformed may be devised to escape.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the third embodiment, the central portion <b>351</b><i>c </i>of the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> is narrower than the end portions <b>351</b><i>a</i>, <b>351</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> is contractable in the circumferential direction. Further, the clearance is formed between the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> and the walls of the guide groove <b>181</b>. Therefore, the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> can be stably deformed by an amount of the clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the end portions <b>351</b><i>a</i>, <b>351</b><i>b </i>of the first elastic block portion <b>351</b>, which are elastically in contact with the end face of the locking projection <b>143</b>, are conversely thickened and therefore, the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> can firmly receive reaction force or shock load applied to the internal gear <b>14</b>. It is preferable that the circumferential end face of the end portion <b>351</b><i>a </i>and the circumferential end face of the locking projection <b>143</b> which are in contact with each other, have the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, the fourth embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. By devising the shape of the first elastic block portion <b>351</b>, the deformation resistance is restrained to be low to provide the shock absorbing member <b>35</b> excellent in shock absorbing function. However, there is a limit therein, for example, when shock load larger than anticipated is abruptly operated, the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> is expanded in an outer diameter direction in accordance with contraction in the circumferential direction and also the outer peripheral face of the constricted portion <b>351</b><i>c </i>is brought into close contact with the inner wall of the guide groove <b>181</b>. Then, abruptly, the deformation resistance of the first elastic block portion <b>351</b> increases. As a result, shock absorbing performance by the shock absorbing member <b>35</b> decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Hence, in order to ensure the shock absorbing function by the shock absorbing member even when shock load or the like larger than anticipated is applied, it is preferable to make a volume of the guide groove <b>181</b> variable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows such a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the fourth embodiment, the internal gear <b>14</b> and the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> are similar to those of the second embodiment. Although the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the shock absorbing member <b>15</b> may be used in place thereof, further, when the shock absorbing member <b>35</b> is used, more excellent shock absorbing function is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The fourth embodiment is characterized in a structure of a gear housing <b>4</b>. The gear housing <b>4</b> includes a circular disc <b>48</b>, a Belleville spring <b>47</b>, and a case <b>46</b>. The circular disk <b>48</b> is formed with guide grooves <b>481</b> penetrated in a circular arc shape uniformly at four locations. The belleville spring <b>47</b> is arranged on an axially front side of the circular disk <b>48</b>. The case <b>46</b> has a bottomed cylindrical shape. The case <b>46</b> surrounds the circular disk <b>48</b> and the belleville spring <b>47</b> and has a through hole <b>463</b> at a center thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the respective members are arranged as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and integrated, the belleville spring <b>47</b> forms a bottom portion of the guide grooves <b>481</b>. When load is applied in the axial direction, the belleville spring <b>47</b> is flexed in a direction of the load to expand a volume of the guide groove <b>481</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Specifically, when the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> is pressed by the locking projection <b>143</b> of the internal gear <b>14</b> to contract in the circumferential direction, the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> is expanded to an outer side, thereby pressing the belleville spring <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When the pressing force exceeds predetermined load, the belleville spring <b>47</b> is flexed and the volume of the guide groove <b>481</b> is expanded. As a result, the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> contracted in the circumferential direction is produced with an allowance of further expanding to the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this way, stable shock absorbing function by the shock absorbing member <b>25</b> is ensured without rapidly increasing the deformation resistance of the first elastic block portion <b>251</b>. Further, a clearance for bending the belleville spring <b>47</b> is naturally ensured between the belleville spring <b>47</b> and a bottom portion of the case <b>46</b>. A wave washer or the like may substitute for the belleville spring <b>47</b>. Further, although not illustrated in the drawings, a stopper is provided between an outer peripheral side of the internal gear <b>14</b> and the gear housing <b>4</b>, <b>18</b>. Thereby, an allowed revolution amount of the internal gear <b>10</b> is finally restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this way, the volume of the guide grooves <b>481</b> can be changed in accordance with contraction of the first elastic block portion <b>251</b> without devising the shape of the first elastic block portion <b>251</b>. Naturally, the volume of the guide grooves <b>481</b> can be changed also by making an inner wall thereof movable other than the bottom portion. However, in order to change the volume of the guide groove <b>481</b> without increasing an outer diameter of the reduction gear, a request for compact formation of the starter is complied with, further, the change of the volume of the guide groove <b>481</b> can be realized by a comparatively simple mechanism by making the bottom portion movable in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Accordingly, not only the starting apparatus <b>1</b> is compact but also shock load or the like applied to the internal gear <b>14</b> of the reduction gear <b>10</b> is more firmly absorbed and reliability of the internal gear <b>14</b> and therefore, the starting apparatus <b>1</b> can be promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, the fifth embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the internal gear <b>649</b> is formed on an inner cylindrical wall of a cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>. The cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> meshes with the planetary gears <b>12</b> through the internal gear <b>649</b>. A containing case <b>68</b> (case) is provided on the front side (left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>, in place of the gear housing <b>4</b>, <b>18</b>. A shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is interposed between the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> and the containing case <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The cover plate <b>19</b> is provided at a rear end face of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>, similar to the first embodiment. Thus, the cover plates <b>19</b> closes a front portion of the motor housing <b>88</b> of the motor <b>80</b> and restricting the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> from moving backward in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and the containing case <b>68</b> are included in a rotation constraining unit which is characterizing portion of the fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> has substantially a cylindrical shape having a ring-shaped bottom face. The cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is integrally molded by thermoplastic resin. Also the internal gear <b>649</b> is integrally molded on the inner cylindrical wall of the cylindrical portion disposed on the rear side (right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The ring shape bottom face of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is disposed on a front side of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>. The bottom face is provided with three pairs of movable locking projections <b>641</b> and movable contact projections <b>642</b> projecting in the axially forward direction. The movable locking projections <b>641</b> and the movable contact projections <b>642</b> are radially and uniformly arranged. A wall thickness of the movable contact projection <b>642</b> is thicker than a wall thickness of the movable locking projection <b>641</b> to be able to stably receive large reaction force.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is provided with an inner ring-like projection <b>645</b> and an outer ring-like projection <b>646</b> projecting slightly to the front side from an inner peripheral edge and an outer peripheral edge of the bottom face. Further, main movable recessed portions <b>643</b> and sub movable recessed portions <b>644</b>, which are slightly recessed, are alternately formed by the inner ring-like projection <b>645</b>, the outer ring-like projection <b>646</b>, the movable locking projections <b>641</b>, and the movable contact projections <b>642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, a ratio of lengths in the circumferential direction of the main movable recessed portion <b>643</b> and the sub movable recessed portion <b>644</b> can be easily adjusted at where the movable locking projection <b>641</b> is arranged between the contiguous movable contact projections <b>642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> includes a main elastic block portion <b>651</b>, a sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> and a bridging portion <b>653</b> bridging the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b>. The shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is integrally molded by an oil resistant synthetic resin (NBR or the like). Here, the oil resistant synthetic resin is used such that the rubber is not deteriorated even when grease used for reducing abrasive resistance is adhered to the rubber, the function of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is maintained for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The main elastic block portion <b>651</b> is in the form of a fan-shaped block and a surrounding of substantially a central portion thereof is constricted, that is, is narrow. Further, semispherical elastic projections <b>654</b> are provided at an outer peripheral end of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> on both axial front and rear faces to make contact with the containing case <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Although the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> is in the form of a fan-shaped block, its circumferential length is considerably shorter than that of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b>. In this embodiment, the ratio of circumferential lengths of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> is set to about 5:1. The bridging portion <b>653</b> connects ends of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> in a strip-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the containing case <b>68</b> has substantially a circular disk shape. The containing case <b>68</b> is formed by pertinently machining an aluminum alloy cast product. Although a front side (left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of the containing case <b>68</b> is formed substantially in a shape of a planar plate, a rear side (right side) thereof is provided with three pairs of unmovable locking projections <b>681</b> and unmovable contact projections <b>682</b> projected to a rear side in the axial direction. The unmovable locking projections <b>681</b> and unmovable contact projections <b>682</b> are radially and uniformly arranged. A wall thickness of the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b> is thicker than a wall thickness of the unmovable locking projection <b>681</b> to be able to stably receive large reaction force.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, the containing case <b>68</b> is provided with an inner ring-like projection <b>685</b> and an outer ring-like projection <b>686</b> projecting to the rear side from an inner peripheral side and an outer peripheral side on the rear side of the containing case <b>68</b>. Further, main unmovable recessed portions <b>683</b> and sub unmovable recessed portions <b>684</b>, which are recessed, are alternately formed by the inner ring-like projection <b>685</b>, the outer ring-like projection <b>686</b>, the unmovable locking projections <b>681</b>, and the unmovable contact projections <b>682</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, a ratio of circumferential lengths of the main unmovable recessed portion <b>683</b> and the sub unmovable recessed portion <b>684</b> can be easily adjusted by to which portion the unmovable locking projection <b>681</b> is arranged between the contiguous unmovable contact projections <b>682</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The containing case <b>68</b> is provided with a locking piece <b>689</b> on an outer peripheral edge thereof. Although not illustrated, the locking piece <b>689</b> is engaged with a housing of the starter <b>1</b> to constrain such that the containing case <b>68</b> is not rotated in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, an explanation will be given of integration of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and the containing case <b>68</b> with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a disassembled arrangement view of the three members and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a state of integrating the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> to the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the state of integrating the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> to the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> for convenience of explanation, actually, after integrating the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> to the containing case <b>68</b>, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is integrated thereto. An explanation will be given as follows in view thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">First, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is integrated to the containing case <b>68</b>. At this time, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is integrated to the containing case <b>68</b> such that the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is fitted between the unmovable locking projection <b>681</b> and the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b> of the containing case <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is integrated to the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> such that the movable locking projection <b>641</b> formed at the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is pushed in between the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Thereby, the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> are in a state of elastically holding the movable locking projection <b>641</b> therebetween. This integration of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is performed at three locations along the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Thus, the unmovable locking projection <b>681</b> is in a state of being substantially interposed between the movable contact projection <b>642</b> of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> and the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b>. Meanwhile, the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b> is in a state of elastically interposing the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> between the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b> and the movable locking projection <b>641</b> of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, the inner ring-like projection <b>645</b> and the outer ring-like projection <b>646</b> of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> and the inner ring-like projection <b>685</b> and the outer ring-like projection <b>686</b> of the containing case <b>68</b> are formed to respectively correspond to each other. A substantially hermetically sealed inner space is formed between the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> and the containing case <b>68</b>. Three shock absorbing members <b>65</b> are contained in the inner space.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In this condition, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is in a state of being elastically supported in the axial direction (thrust direction) relative to the containing case <b>68</b> by the elastic projections <b>654</b> provided on both face sides of the end portions of the main elastic block portions <b>651</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b>. The elastic projection <b>654</b> has the semispherical shape and makes point contact with the wall face.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Therefore, pivoting of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> relative to the containing case <b>68</b> is hardly hampered, and wear or deterioration of the elastic projection <b>654</b> is inconsiderable. Further, since the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is supported by the shock absorbing members <b>65</b> at the three locations uniformly disposed in the circumferential direction, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is maintained stably. Therefore, transmission loss of the driving force of the internal gear <b>649</b> caused by an inclination or the like thereof, wear or the like thereof can be sufficiently restrained and reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Next, operation of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and the containing case <b>68</b> before and after starting the engine by the starter <b>1</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref> are views respectively developing planarly behaviors before and after operating the starter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As is apparent also from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, before starting the starter <b>1</b>, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is fitted in a space (main unmovable recessed portion <b>683</b>) formed by the unmovable locking projection <b>681</b> and the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b> of the containing case <b>68</b> and the movable locking projection <b>641</b> of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>. Further, the movable contact projection <b>642</b> of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is loosely located in a space (sub unmovable recessed portion <b>684</b>) between the unmovable locking projection <b>681</b> and another one of the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b> contiguous thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, before operating the starter <b>1</b>, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is not substantially compressed except a pre-compression amount in attaching the shock absorbing member <b>65</b>. Also, the movable contact projection <b>642</b> is disposed at a position separated from the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b>, that is, adjacent to the unmovable locking projection <b>681</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Meanwhile, when the starter <b>1</b> starts operation, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> receives the reaction force from the internal gear <b>649</b> in a direction denoted by an arrow A<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. By the reaction force, the movable locking projection <b>641</b> compresses the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> in the direction A<b>1</b> of the reaction force.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In this embodiment, before starting the starter <b>1</b>, the movable locking projection <b>641</b> and the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> are held in a state of being elastically in close contact with each other. Therefore, the reaction force applied to the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is gradually absorbed from the start by the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> via the movable locking projection <b>641</b>. Accordingly, it is less likely that shock load or the like will be applied rapidly thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, when the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> is compressed, the main unmovable recessed portion <b>683</b> achieves a function of a guide groove and the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and the movable locking projection <b>641</b> are respectively guided thereby. Further, the sub unmovable recessed portion <b>684</b> achieves a function of a guide groove and the movable contact projection <b>642</b> is guided thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the reaction force is further increased and a compressed amount of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> by the movable locking projection <b>641</b> reaches a vicinity of a limit (for example, compressed amount of 30%), the movable contact projection <b>642</b> rotated integrally with the movable locking projection <b>641</b> is brought into contact with the unmovable contact projection <b>682</b> of the fixed containing case <b>68</b> as in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Then, thereafter, the cylindrical resin portion <b>64</b> cannot be rotated in the direction A<b>1</b> of the reaction force. Thus, the compressed amount of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> is restricted from exceeding the limit compressed amount (maximum compressed amount) by the movable locking projection <b>641</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, when the reaction force applied to the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is released after starting the engine, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> return from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> to the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. At this time, the movable locking projection <b>641</b> is reversely moved, that is, returned toward another unmovable contact projection <b>182</b> (to a bottom side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>). However, inherently, the operated force is weak and the sub elastic block portion <b>152</b> is present between the movable locking projection <b>641</b> and the unmovable contact projection <b>182</b>. Therefore, shock load or the like is hardly applied to respective portions at this time. Accordingly, it is less likely that unpleasant sound or the like will occur at the surrounding.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the starter <b>1</b>, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> of the reduction gear <b>10</b> is restricted from rotating at least in one direction by the rotation restricting means including the movable locking portion <b>641</b>, the unmovable locking portion <b>681</b>, and the shock absorbing member <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> serves as vibration isolating member and therefore, can absorb vibration or sound generated at the reduction gear <b>10</b> or a surrounding thereof. In this way, the reduction gear <b>10</b> of the invention can sufficiently reduce vibration, unpleasant sound or the like generated in operating the starting apparatus although the reduction gear <b>10</b> is provided with a comparatively simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Meanwhile, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> has an elastic projected portion <b>654</b> projecting from at least one side of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> in the axial direction. The elastic projected portion <b>654</b> elastically holds the internal gear in the axial direction. That is, the elastic projected portion <b>654</b> serves as a thrust bearing of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b>. Further, vibration, deflection or the like of the internal gear <b>10</b> is restrained and therefore, a stable output at reduced speed is provided without bringing about wear or the like of the internal gear <b>649</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Further, the elastic projected portion <b>654</b> is projected from the axial end face of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and therefore, an area thereof in contact with a sliding wall disposed on the side in the axial direction of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is very small. Therefore, as compared with the case in which an axial side face of the elastic block portion is totally brought into slide contact with a wall face or the like of a case containing the elastic block portion, movement of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> in compressing operation becomes very smooth. In addition thereto, since the elastic projected portion <b>654</b> is mainly slide contact with the sliding wall face or the like. Therefore, wear or deterioration of the first elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the like is reduced. Accordingly, reliability of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In consideration of various vibrations applied to the internal gear <b>649</b>, integration tolerance and the like, it is preferable that the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is elastically held also in the axial direction. The shock absorbing member <b>65</b> has the elastic projected portions <b>654</b> projecting in the axial direction. Further, the elastic projected portions <b>654</b> are on the side of the unmovable locking projections <b>681</b>. Therefore, the elastic projected portions <b>654</b> are not dragged when the movable locking portions <b>641</b> slide. Accordingly, the elastic projected portions <b>654</b> achieve stable holding function.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, since the elastic projected portions <b>654</b> have semispherical shapes and make point contact with an abrasive face, abrasion resistance is reduced. Therefore, the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is smoothly moved. Further, since the sliding area is small, wear and damage of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Further, by providing the elastic projected portions <b>654</b> on the first elastic block portion <b>651</b>, rigidity of the first elastic block portion <b>651</b> at a vicinity thereof increases. With this, unexpected deformation of the elastic block portion <b>651</b>, which is compressed in operating the starter <b>1</b>, can be restrained and therefore, reliability of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Further, the rotation constraining unit includes the movable contact portion <b>642</b> and the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b>. The movable contact portion <b>642</b> is arranged at a predetermined interval from the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and integrally pivoted with the movable locking portion <b>641</b>. The unmovable contact portion <b>682</b> extends in the axial direction to be opposed to the movable contact portion <b>642</b>, faces the movable contact portion <b>642</b> in the circumferential direction. The unmovable contact portion <b>682</b> is arranged in a state of being unmovable in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Thus, a compressed amount of the elastic block portion <b>651</b> by the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the unmovable locking portion <b>681</b> can be restricted by bringing the movable contact portion <b>642</b> and the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b> into contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In this structure, even when the large reaction force is applied to the internal gear <b>649</b>, rotation of the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> is restricted to a range until bringing the movable contact portion <b>642</b> into contact with the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b>. Therefore, also a compressed amount of the elastic block portion <b>651</b> by the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the unmovable locking portion <b>681</b> is restricted within a predetermined range. Thereby, destruction, damage, early fatigue or the like of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> by an excessively large compressed amount can be decreased beforehand. Thus, reliability of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and therefore, reliability of the starter <b>1</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Further, even when large reaction force is applied to the internal gear <b>649</b>, the movable contact portion <b>642</b> and the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b> are operated as a detent. Therefore, rotation of the internal gear <b>64</b> is restricted. Accordingly, an input from the drive motor <b>80</b> is efficiently speed reduced and outputted from the carrier <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Since the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the unmovable locking portion <b>681</b> are elastically held by the elastic block portion <b>651</b>, load is elastically and gradually applied to the movable locking portion <b>641</b> from the start of operation of the starter <b>1</b>. Further, also when the elastic block portion <b>651</b> returns after starting the engine, force is gradually exerted to the movable locking portion <b>641</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Here, a state in which the elastic block portion <b>651</b> is elastically held between the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the unmovable locking portion <b>681</b> is achieved by integrating the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> between the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the unmovable locking portion <b>681</b> in a state that the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is slightly compressed. In this way, the highly reliable and highly efficient starter <b>1</b> restraining unpleasant sound or the like is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Further, the compressed amount (maximum compressed amount) allowed to the elastic block portion <b>651</b> can be easily set to change by adjusting an interval between the movable contact portion <b>642</b> and the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b>. Thus, the reduction gear <b>10</b> has flexibility in designing.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As the shock absorbing member <b>65</b>, a spring, synthetic resin, synthetic rubber or the like can be used. The elastic rubber block including synthetic rubber as in the embodiment has a degree of freedom of the shape. Thus, the elastic rubber is preferable in view of function, reliability, cost, integration performance or the like. Particularly, when the elastic block portion includes synthetic rubber, it is preferable that the movable contact portion <b>642</b> and the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b> are arranged such that a maximum compression rate thereof falls in a range of 10% through 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A general allowable maximum compression rate of synthetic resin is normally set to be around 20% in consideration of durability thereof. In the case that the elastic block portion is used in a short period of time in starting the engine, even if the compression rate exceeds 20%, the reliability may not be deteriorated for a long period of time. However, when the compression rate exceeds 30%, the elastic block portion may be destructed or damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Hence, in the embodiment, the compression rate is confined in 30%. Further, an upper limit of the compression rate can be easily restricted by the movable contact portion <b>642</b> and the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b>. A lower limit of the compression rate is set to 10% for effectively utilizing elasticity of the elastic block portion.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">An explanation has mainly been given of the case of compressing the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> by the movable locking portion <b>641</b>. However, a direction of force applied to the movable locking portion <b>641</b> is changed before and after starting the engine. Therefore, the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and therefore, the internal gear <b>64</b> can be rotated in a direction opposite to the direction of the reaction force.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Here, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> includes the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> elastically held between the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the unmovable contact portion <b>682</b> and the bridging portion <b>653</b> connecting the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> to span the movable locking portion <b>641</b>. Also, the ratio of the circumferential length of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> as compared with that of the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> is in a range of 4 through 6.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Thereby, the movable locking portion <b>641</b> is elastically held by the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> even on the side opposite to the main elastic block portion <b>651</b>. As a result, the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and therefore, the internal cylindrical resin member <b>649</b> are held in a state of being elastically held in both rotational directions thereof. Therefore, the movable locking portion <b>641</b> is in a state of being held further stably. Accordingly, unpleasant sound and vibrations reduce in the reduction gear <b>10</b>. Further, since the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> are connected by the bridging portion <b>653</b>. Therefore, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is easily integrated. Further, it facilitates part control.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Here, the ratio of the circumferential length of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> with respect to that of the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b> is made in the range of 4 through 6 because the force applied in a direction of compressing the main elastic block portion <b>651</b>, that is, reaction force in starting, is larger than the force applied in a direction of compressing the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b>, that is, the force opposite to reaction force.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In a case that the ratio of the circumferential length is less than 4, it is difficult to ensure durability of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b>. Further, in a case that the ratio of the circumferential length exceeds 6, it is difficult to achieve compact formation. Here, the ratio of the circumferential length may be compared by lengths of center circle arcs of the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> and the sub elastic block portion <b>652</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The substantially center portion in the circumferential direction of the elastic block portion (main elastic block portion) <b>651</b> is constricted narrower than the end portion thereof. Therefore, the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> is compressible in the circumferential direction. Also, a deformation resistance is reduced at least at the constricted central portion. When the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> is compressed, the constricted portion is expanded to the surrounding.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Because a change of shape accompanied by the compression is brought about the constricted portion, elasticity of the elastic block portion is effectively utilized. Thus, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> provides large shock absorbing function. Further, the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> is not constricted at an end portion thereof. Therefore, the main elastic block portion <b>651</b> is stably held at the end portions thereof by the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the unmovable locking portion <b>681</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the embodiment, a mode, a number or the like of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> is not particularly limited. However, in order to achieve compact formation of the starter <b>1</b> and stable operation of the internal gear <b>649</b>, it is preferable to arrange the shock absorbing members <b>65</b> respectively uniformly at three locations or more in the circumferential direction. Hence, it is preferable that three pairs or more of the movable locking portions <b>641</b> and the movable contact portions <b>642</b> and the unmovable locking portions <b>681</b> and the unmovable contact portions <b>682</b> are respectively arranged uniformly in the circumferential direction. Similarly, it is preferable that three or more pairs of the movable contact portions <b>642</b> and the unmovable contact portions <b>682</b> are arranged uniformly in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Thereby, inclination or deviation of the internal gear <b>64</b> in starting can be restrained and the smooth operation of the starting apparatus is ensured. Further, also reaction force in starting can be received by a plurality of the elastic block portions <b>651</b>. Therefore, the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> can be downsized and stable shock absorbing function can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the movable contact portion <b>642</b> are integrally molded in the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> having the bottom. Also, the internal gear <b>649</b> is formed in the inner cylindrical wall of the resin member <b>649</b>. By integrating those members, part control or integration is facilitated. Further, even when the cylindrical resin member <b>64</b> has a complicated shape, it can be comparatively easily be provided at low cost by integral molding of resin.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, shock due to the reaction force applied to the internal gear <b>649</b> and the movable locking portion <b>641</b> can be sufficiently absorbed by the shock absorbing member <b>65</b>. Therefore, even when the members are integrally molded by resin, the members are not destructed or damaged and are excellent in wear resistance and highly reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Although the movable locking portions <b>641</b> and the movable contact portions <b>642</b> are rotated integrally with an internal gear <b>649</b>, it is not always necessary that those members are integrated. For example, there may be established a locking relationship in which the movable locking portion <b>641</b> and the movable contact portion <b>642</b> of the internal gear are constituted by separate members and the both members are integrally rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In this way, the starter <b>1</b> receives the reaction force, which is caused in operating the starter <b>1</b>, by the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> while alleviating the reaction force. Further, the starter <b>1</b> reduces damage or the like of the shock absorbing member <b>65</b> and is still and highly reliable. Further, sufficient reliability is ensured even when the internal gear <b>649</b> made of resin is used.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In this description, “unmovable” state referring to the unmovable locking portion or the unmovable contact portion signifies that the portion is not substantially pivoted. It is not used against play or vibrations. Further, the starter <b>1</b> is not limited to the gear type starter but may be other type of starter. Further, “circumferential direction” and “axial direction” are defined relative to a rotation center axis of the reduction gear <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The present invention should not be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but may be implemented in other ways without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
