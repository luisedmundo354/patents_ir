<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to transistors and more particularly to an improved N-type lateral double diffusion metal oxide semiconductor that has a shallow trench isolation region between the gate and the drain.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Power semiconductor devices are currently being used in many applications. Such power devices include high-voltage integrated circuits, which typically include one or more high-voltage transistors, often on the same chip as low-voltage circuitry. A commonly used high-voltage component for these circuits is the lateral double diffused MOS transistor (LDMOS). LDMOS structures used in high-voltage integrated circuits may generally be fabricated using some of the same techniques used to fabricate the low voltage circuitry or logic circuitry. In general, these existing LDMOS structures are fabricated in a thick epitaxial layer of opposite conductivity type to the substrate or they use a thin epitaxial layer and apply the RESURF (reduced surface field) principle (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,787, that is incorporated herein by reference, for a complete description of RESURF) to equally distribute the applied drain voltage laterally across the silicon surface in the drift region of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">High-power applications call for the use of such lateral double diffused MOS transistors primarily because they possess lower “on” resistance (“Rdson”), faster switching speed, and lower gate drive power dissipation than their bi-polar counterparts. These devices have heretofore also been strongly associated with bi-polar based process flows when integrated into a Bi-CMOS (bipolar complementary metal oxide semiconductor) environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention provides a transistor having a gate, a channel region below the gate, a source region on one side of the channel region, a drain region on an opposite side of the channel region from the source region, a shallow trench isolation (STI) region in the substrate between the drain region and the channel region, and a drain extension below the STI region. The drain extension is positioned along the bottom of the STI region and along the portion of sides of the STI. Portions of the drain extension along the bottom of the STI may comprise different dopant implants than the portions of the drain extensions along the sides of the STI. Portions of the drain extensions along sides of the STI extend from the bottom of the STI to a position partially up the sides of the STI. The STI region is below a portion of the gate. The drain extension provides a conductive path between the drain region and the channel region around a lower perimeter of the STI. The drain region is positioned further from the gate than the source region.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention also discloses a method of manufacturing a transistor. First, the method forms a trench in a substrate. Next, the method partially fills the trench with a sacrificial material, and then forms spacers in the trench above the sacrificial material. The method removes the sacrificial material and implants a drain extension through the trench into exposed portions of the substrate. The drain extension is implanted to regions of the substrate along sides and the bottom of the trench. The method fills the trench with a shallow trench isolation (STI) material. The method defines a channel region in the substrate on one side the STI material. The invention forms a source region in the substrate on an opposite side of the channel region from the STI material. The method then forms a drain region in the substrate on an opposite side of the STI material from the channel region. Lastly, the method forms a gate above the channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The implanting process includes a vertical implant which forms a drain extension in the portion of the substrate along the bottom of the substrate and an angled implant to form the drain extension in the portion of the substrate along the sides of the substrate. The spacers and the sacrificial material control the size and location of the drain extension. The implanting process forms portions of the drain extensions along sides of the STI from the bottom of the STI to a position partially up the sides of the STI. The forming of the gate extends a portion of the gate over the STI material. The drain extension provides a conductive path between the drain region and the channel region around a lower perimeter of the STI. The process of forming the drain region positions the drain region further from the gate than the source region. The process of implanting the drain extension includes protecting regions other than the trench to limit the implanting process to the trench.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The manufacturing process shown above is advantageous when compared to conventional manufacturing processes because the invention forms the drain extension directly through the trench opening. Thus, a lower energy implant can be used than is used conventionally. Further, the penetration depth and unwanted diffusion is easily controlled because the implant is being made through the trench opening. In addition, the trench opening aligns the impurity implant more precisely than conventional methods that must pass the higher energy implant through the recessed oxide. Therefore, as shown above, the invention provides improved channel length control with maskless trench aligned implant and reduced straggle (unwanted diffusion) of the deep implant. This reduces on resistance (Rdson), and overlap capacitance (Cov), and increases the on current (Ion).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Integration of microelectronics into consumer appliances, automotive, space technologies, etc., drives a market utilizing high performance CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor), BJT's (bipolar junction transistors) and power MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) drivers. The lateral DMOS (LDMOS) transistor is typically chosen as the driving transistor, capable of switching high voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a typical N-DMOS device schematic. The device includes a substrate <b>10</b>, source <b>11</b>, gate <b>12</b>, and drain <b>13</b>. In the device off state, the voltage of the drain <b>13</b> (Vdrain) is typically at a high positive potential (i.e., the “appliance switching or mixed level”). The voltage of the gate <b>12</b> (Vgate) is typically at or near ground, i.e., less than the turn on potential of the device. The voltage differential that will exist between the drain and gate presents significant stress upon the gate oxide and it is an important design goal to protect the gate oxide from being destroyed by these large voltages. The voltage of the source <b>11</b> (Vsource) may be at ground, or at the CMOS internal level, and for sake of simplicity, the voltage of the substrate <b>10</b> (Vsubstrate) is at ground also. In the on state, the Vdrain to source is typically at hundreds of millivolts, and the Vgate to source voltage is at the CMOS internal level. A typical N-LDMOS threshold voltage is approximately 1 volt. Thus, in the preferred on-state Vgs&gt;&gt;Vt, and Vds&lt;&lt;(Vgs−Vt), thus the device operates in a linear mode. Vdrain, or the external appliance potential can approach voltage levels in excess of 20 volts, while the internal CMOS levels are typically between 1 volt and 3.3 volts. Internally, the CMOS levels cannot operate at the appliance voltage levels, as gate oxides would be destroyed, and the appliance voltages cannot operate at the internal CMOS levels, as the voltages are too low for appliance operation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> displays a cross-section of a 24 volt N-LDMOS device. Some of the elements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> include the n buried layer <b>200</b>, the body <b>216</b>, a combined source/body contact <b>214</b> (p− doped and n+ doped regions <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and n+ extension <b>232</b>), a sidewall spacer <b>224</b>, and a polysilicon gate <b>212</b>. Item <b>218</b> superimposes the parasitic NPN schematic over the structure. The drain <b>208</b> includes n+ region <b>206</b>. The extended drain region, comprising an n-drift region <b>202</b> and an n−layer <b>204</b>, extends under a field oxide <b>210</b> for on-resistance (Rdson) control. The polysilicon gate <b>212</b> extends over the field oxide <b>210</b> and a gate oxide <b>213</b> is below the gate <b>212</b>. To minimize device area the p-body and source terminals are usually common <b>214</b> but for substrate current analysis, device arrays can also be fabricated with separate source and body contacts. The threshold voltage (Vt) for this device is ˜1.0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The performance parameters for an optimized design are low and controlled Rdson/Overlap Capacitance at the drain terminal, and high Vdrain breakdown voltage. This implies that a “high” drive current is the result of a minimized and controlled Rdson for the LDMOS device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one practice of designing the high voltage drain <b>208</b> uses a photo-resist mask <b>226</b> over the grown thick oxide. The n− deep part <b>204</b> of the junction is implanted <b>228</b> through the photo-resist <b>226</b>, and the shallow n+ part <b>206</b> of the junction follows <b>228</b>. This process results in a device having a large straggle in the control of the lateral extent due primarily to the large implant energy (e.g., 80 Kev) required to reach through the recessed oxide and the mask alignment to the recessed oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The limitations described above also limit the minimum channel length design for such a device, further constraining the chip function due to I/O requirements. More specifically, the channel region <b>230</b> runs approximately between the n− layer <b>204</b> and the n+ doped region <b>222</b>. The size and shape of the bird's beak of the field oxide <b>210</b> (e.g., the left and right sides of the field oxide <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) restricts the length of the channel region <b>230</b> and is a very difficult feature to control. Thus, the bird's beak shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> substantially limits the control over channel length. Device layout has a substantial impact on LDMOS HC performance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is taken from D. Brisbon et al., “Hot Carrier Reliability and Design of N-LDMOS Transistor Arrays” 2001 IRW Final Report (incorporated herein by reference) and displays measured Rdson lifetime as a function of specific on-resistance (Rdson_sp) and source to drain edge spacing L, where: Rdson_sp=Rdson*Area Array. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that increasing L by just 0.9 μm increases Rdson HC lifetime by seven orders of magnitude, though this improved HC performance is attained at the expense of increased Rdson_sp and array area. Therefore, control of the channel length (e.g., source to drain spacing) is crucial to device performance and longevity. In addition, lack of control of the L-DMOS high voltage junction leads to hot carrier reliability issues that parallel spacer-induced damage in CMOS.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention provides control over the source to drain spacing by integrating shallow trench isolation (STI) and low energy pre-implants prior to isolating adjacent transistors. The pre-implant is performed to dope the drain extension. One additional control feature provided by the invention is a STI sidewall spacer formation that is used to control the out-diffusion of the self-aligned junction floor pre-implant.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates this self-aligned junction floor n− implant <b>40</b> below the shallow trench isolation <b>41</b> that is added to the conventional structure for control of both source to drain spacing and Rdson. The implant <b>40</b> replaces the conventional drain extension and comprises the drain extension in the inventive structure. In addition, in a second embodiment (discussed in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>), the invention provides vertical drain extensions <b>42</b> on the side walls of the STI <b>41</b>. With the vertical drain extensions <b>42</b>, the parasitic device resistance is easily controlled. A continuous conductive path is supplied around the periphery of the shallow trench isolation <b>41</b> from the drain <b>206</b>, <b>204</b> directly to the channel region <b>230</b>. In addition, the formation of the trench structure <b>41</b> eliminates the “birds beak” field oxide <b>210</b> shape and thereby avoids all disadvantages associated with a birds beak structure, such as difficulty in controlling channel length, Vdrain degradation, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> benefits from a number of advantages when compared to the structure shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> because the high voltage drain <b>206</b> is thoroughly insulated from the gate <b>212</b> (and underlying sensitive gate oxide <b>213</b>) by the shallow trench isolation region <b>41</b>. Since the STI trench is the first element in this process, it is easily aligned with (e.g., self-aligned) with the later formed CMOS device. To the contrary, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the field oxide <b>210</b> encroaches upon the CMOS gate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> show one embodiment where the deep drain implant is controlled by using a low energy STI trench. In this embodiment, the shallow trench isolation region <b>41</b> is formed before the remaining structures of the transistor are formed. Therefore, such structures are not illustrated in the drawings. However, one ordinarily skilled in the art would understand that the shallow trench isolation region <b>41</b> and drain extension <b>40</b> could easily be formed at many different processing points during the creation of the transistor, and the embodiments described herein are intended to cover all such possible methodologies.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the invention begins with a substrate <b>50</b> (e.g., silicon, pre-doped or undoped) with an overlying dielectric pad <b>51</b> formed according to well known processes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a mask <b>60</b> (such as a photolithographic mask) is formed over the pad material <b>51</b> and patterned to create an opening <b>62</b>. An etching process is then performed to remove the exposed portions of the pad material <b>51</b> and the silicon <b>50</b> to create a trench <b>61</b> in the silicon <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The mask <b>60</b> is then removed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Sidewall spacers <b>71</b> (e.g., nitride, oxide, etc.) are then formed in the trench <b>61</b>. The processes for forming sidewall spacers are well known to those ordinarily skilled in the art. For example, one process deposits or grows the spacer material and then performs a directional etch that removes material from horizontal surfaces at a higher rate than it removes material from vertical surfaces, thereby leaving the spacers only on the sidewalls of the structure. Any such processes could be used to form the sidewall spacers <b>71</b>. An implant (e.g., n− implant) <b>70</b> is then performed to create the impurity implantation region <b>72</b>. By directly implanting into the silicon <b>50</b>, a lower energy and more highly controlled implant can be utilized. Further, the size of the spacers <b>71</b> can be varied to provide precise control regarding the size of the impurity region <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the opening <b>61</b> is filled with insulating shallow trench isolation material <b>41</b> (e.g., nitride, oxide, etc.) and a thermal annealing process is performed on the structure to diffuse the impurity implantation region <b>72</b> outward to create the junction outdiffusion region <b>81</b>. After this, conventional processing such as that described in U.S. 6,242,787 (incorporated herein are reference) is performed to create the drain region, source, gate, insulators, contacts, etc. that form the final functional device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The STI region <b>41</b> can comprise a portion of the gate oxide <b>213</b> in the final structure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> illustrate a second embodiment where the deep drain implant is controlled by utilizing an angled implant method. More specifically, the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is similar to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, before the sidewall spacers <b>71</b> are formed, an oxide fill <b>90</b> is grown in the lower portion of the trench <b>61</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the oxide film <b>90</b> is removed and the vertical implant <b>70</b> is performed. In addition one or more angled implants <b>100</b> (with the same or different impurities, concentrations, etc.) are performed to implant impurities <b>42</b> along one or both of the exposed sidewalls of the trench that are below the spacers <b>71</b>. The depth at which the oxide fill <b>90</b> is grown determines the height of the exposed portion below the spacers <b>71</b> and correspondingly determines how far up the trench sidewall from the bottom of the trench the sidewall impurity regions <b>42</b> will extend. While the sidewall impurity regions <b>42</b> are shown as extending approximately halfway up the trench sidewalls, their position can be controlled (by the depth of the oxide fill <b>90</b>) depending upon the individual circuit designer's requirements. Next, the trench is filled with the STI material and the remaining device structures are formed as was done in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of the invention. In item <b>1100</b>, the invention forms a trench in a substrate. Next, in item <b>1102</b>, the invention partially fills the trench with a sacrificial material. The invention then forms spacers in the trench above the sacrificial material in item <b>1104</b>. In item <b>1106</b>, the invention removes the sacrificial material. Next, in item <b>1108</b>, the invention performs a vertical implants. In item <b>1110</b>, the invention performs an angled implant. In item <b>1112</b>, the invention fills the trench with a shallow trench isolation (STI) material. In item <b>1114</b>, the invention defines a channel region. In item <b>1116</b>, the invention forms a source region. In item <b>1118</b>, the invention forms a drain region. In item. <b>1120</b>, the invention forms a gate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The manufacturing process shown above is advantageous when compared to conventional manufacturing processes because the invention forms the drain extension <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> directly through the trench opening <b>61</b>. Thus, a lower energy implant (e.g., 10-40 Kev) can be used. This is a substantial improvement over the implants required through the Fox (<b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Fox implants are typically in excess of 80 Kev, and as such they have a very large lateral straggle, and suffer high implant damage. The high straggle effects the control of Lmin, and the implant damage causes high device junction leakage. Further, the penetration depth and unwanted diffusion by using the trench process is easily controlled because the implant is made through the trench opening. In addition, the trench opening <b>61</b> aligns the impurity implant more precisely than conventional methods that must pass the higher energy implant through the recessed oxide <b>210</b>. Therefore, as shown above, the invention provides improved channel length control with maskless trench aligned implant and reduced straggle (unwanted diffusion) of the deep implant. This reduces on resistance (Rdson), and overlap capacitance (Cov), and increases the on current (Ion).</p>
