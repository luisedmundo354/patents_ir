<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention is generally in the field of manufacturing of multi-layer structures, such as semiconductor wafers, ICs, and non-EUV and EUV masks and relates to measuring pattern overlay alignment accuracy, measuring location of alignment marks, detecting defects on wafers and masks, and measuring CDs of pattern features through the use of displacement interferometric metrology systems and interferometric imaging metrology systems operating in the IR to VUV and EUV and the use of measured properties of electromagnetic fields in the IR to VUV and EUV that are reflected/scattered by measurement objects comprising unpatterned and patterned wafers and masks augmented with results of inversion analyses based on rigorous treatment of electromagnetic fields reflected/scattered by the measurement objects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aerial imaging overlay technology has been a reassuringly familiar feature of semiconductor manufacturing for years, experiencing little change. The wafers are loaded, special box-in-box (BiB) structures or targets are examined using a white-light microscope, and the images are then processed to determine overlay error. Although this has worked well, there are several issues as the industry moves toward implementing deep nanometer process levels with for example image overlay tools, location of alignment marks used in a stage metrology system of lithography tool or inspection tool, and measurement of properties such as CDs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With respect to overlay metrology, one of these issues has to do with the traditionally used BiB structures which tend to have large geometries and typically consist of bars microns in size that do not correspond to circuit feature sizes. Additionally, the BiB structures tend to have large areas of low feature density which polish at different rates than circuit areas with high feature density. As increasingly smaller features are being produced, it has become apparent that the behavior of these traditional BiB targets does not accurately reflect that of the circuit features themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This imaging overlay uncertainty has been tolerable because process windows have not had to be too tight and the available precision and accuracy have been adequate. Now, smaller geometries are resulting in accuracy issues that must be addressed in imaging overlay tools, in particular the tool-induced shift (TIS). For imaging overlay tools, TIS can be on the order of several nanometers. At the 65 nm node, 2 or 3 nm of TIS is a significant measurement uncertainty.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Imaging overlay makes it difficult to reduce TIS because it is critically dependent upon residual aberrations in the imaging overlay optics with the most critical one being the microscope objective. Strehl ratios as high as 0.9 often do not provide the TIS performance required for advanced design rules. Thus, the technology faces not only optical problems but the fact that traditional overlay marks do not represent the actual behavior of circuit features that are orders of magnitude smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Overlay metrology is the art of checking the quality of alignment after lithography. Overlay error is defined as the offset between two patterned layers from their ideal relative position. An overlay error is a vector quantity with two components in the plane of the wafer. Depending on the context, overlay error may signify one of the components or the magnitude of the vector.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Overlay metrology saves subsequent process steps that would be built on a faulty foundation in case of an alignment error. Overlay metrology provides the information that is necessary to correct the alignment of the stepper-scanner and thereby minimize overlay error on subsequent wafers. Moreover, overlay errors detected on a given wafer after exposing and developing the photoresist can be corrected by removing the photoresist and repeating the lithography step on a corrected stepper-scanner. If the measured error is minor, parameters for subsequent steps of the lithography process could be adjusted based on the output of the overlay metrology to avoid excursions. If overlay error is measured subsequently, e.g. after the etch step that typically follows the develop step, it can be used to “scrap” severely mis-processed wafers, or to adjust process equipment for better performance on subsequent wafers, i.e. APC.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the CD in IC device reduces, the total overlay budget needs to be more stringent. Typically, the allowable overlay error is ⅓ of the CD in the IC device. In this case, robustness of alignment mark is critical as accurate signal is required by the scanner's alignment system to precisely align a pattern of a layer to the pattern of the previous layer. Alignment issue is more severe in a back-end process partly due to the influence of CMP, which contributes to the asymmetric or total destruction of the alignment marks. The corresponding error in overlay accuracy has been called wafer induced shift (WIS).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Alignment marks and patterns used in overlay metrology can be placed on/in the scribe-line between die sites on a wafer in order not to waste the usable area on the wafer. Dimensions of a standard scribe-line are 80 microns. Preferably, the alignment marks and the patterns should be as small as possible so as to create the option of reducing the size of scribe-lines and subsequently lead to an increase in the usable area on the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, reduced physical size of alignment marks and of overlay patterns used in overlay metrology reduces the magnitude of the diffracted signals detected in determination of alignment marks and overlay errors, respectively. Thus it is desirable to have an alignment mark metrology system and an overlay metrology system that meet the overlay accuracy requirements, have reduced TIS, can compensate for WIS, and reduces the area required for the alignment marks and the overlay patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The problems that arise in an optical measurement of a CD can also include those introduced by TIS and WIS. Thus an overlay metrology system and an alignment mark metrology system that successfully address the affects of TIS and WIS for a given technology node can be adapted for use in an improved CD metrology system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Defects of different types can affect the performance of overlay, alignment mark, and CD metrology systems. Accordingly, it is desirable for the respective metrology systems to be able to detect the presence of defects and take appropriate measures when the presence of a defect is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Prior overlay metrology methods use built-in test patterns etched or otherwise formed into or on the various layers during the same set of lithography steps that form the patterns for circuit elements on the wafer. The typical BiB pattern consists of two concentric squares, formed on a lower and an upper layer, respectively. “Bar-in-bar” is a similar pattern with just the edges of the “boxes” demarcated, and broken into disjoint line segments. Typically one is the upper pattern and the other is the lower pattern, i.e. corresponding to earlier and later steps in the process. There are other patterns used for overlay metrology. The squares or bars are formed by lithographic and other processes used to make planar structures, e.g., CMP. Currently, the patterns for the boxes or bars are stored on lithography masks and projected onto the wafer. Other methods for putting the patterns on the wafer are possible, e.g. direct electron beam writing from computer memory, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one form of the prior art, a high performance microscope imaging system combined with image processing software estimates overlay error for the two layers. The image processing software uses the intensity of light at a multitude of pixels. Obtaining the overlay error accurately requires a high quality imaging system and means of focusing it. Some of this prior art is reviewed by the article “Semiconductor Pattern Overlay”, by Neal T. Sullivan, <i>Handbook of Critical Dimension Metrology and Process Control</i>, Kevin M. Monahan, ed., <i>SPIE </i>Optical Engineering Press, CR52, pp 160. A. Starikov, D. J. Coleman, P. J. Larson, A. D. Lapata, and W. A. Muth in “Accuracy of Overlay Measurements: Tool and Mark Asymmetry Effects,” <i>Optical Engineering</i>, 31, pp 1298 (1992), teach measuring overlay at one wafer orientation, rotating the wafer by 180°, measuring overlay again and attributing the difference to tool errors and overlay mark asymmetry.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One requirement for the optical system is very stable positioning of the optical system with respect to the sample. Relative vibration would blur the image and degrade the performance. This is a difficult requirement to meet for overlay metrology systems that are integrated into a process tool. The tool causes potentially large accelerations (vibrations), e.g. due to high acceleration wafer handlers. The tight space requirements for integration preclude bulky isolation strategies.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The imaging based overlay measurement precision can be two orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of the light used to image the target patterns of concentric boxes or bars. At such small length scales, the image does not have well determined edges because of diffraction. The determination of the edge, and therefore the overlay measurement, is affected by any factor that changes the diffraction pattern. CMP is a commonly used technique to planarize the wafer surface at intermediate process steps before depositing more material. CMP can render the profile of the trenches or lines that make up the overlay measurement targets asymmetric. The asymmetry in target changes the diffraction pattern, thus potentially causing an overlay measurement error.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207, Chappelow, et al. teach obtaining the quantitative value of the overlay offset from the reflectance of targets that consists of identical line gratings that are overlaid upon each other on a planar substrate. Chappelow et al. approximate the reflectance of the overlapping gratings as the average of the reflectances of four film stacks weighted by their area-fractions. This approximation, which neglects diffraction, has some validity when the lines and spaces are larger than largest wavelength of the reflectometer. The reflectance of each of the four film stacks is measured at a so called macro-site close to the overlay target. Each macro-site has a uniform film stack over a region that is larger than the measurement spot of the reflectometer. A limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that spatial variations in the film thickness that are caused by CMP and resist loss during lithography will cause erroneous overlay measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that reflectance is measured at eight sites in one overlay metrology target, which increases the size of the target and decreases the throughput of the measurement. Another limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that the lines and spaces need to be large compared to the wavelength, but small compared to the measurement spot which limits the accuracy and precision of the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that the light intensity is measured by a single photodiode. The dependence of the optical properties of the sample is not measured as a function of wavelength, or angle of incidence, or polarization, which limits the precision of the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The “average reflectivity” approximation for the interaction of light with gratings, as employed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207, greatly simplifies the problem of light interaction with a grating but neglects much of the diffraction physics. The model used to interpret the data has four distinct regions whose respective reflectivities are determined by the combination of layers formed by the substrate and the overlaid patterns and by the respective materials in the substrate and patterns. Eq. (1) in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 clearly indicates that these regions do not interact, i.e. via diffraction, as the total reflectivity of the structure is a simple average of the four reflectivities with area weighting.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin 90A 60854/GE8880210, March 1990, pp 170, teaches measuring offset between two patterned layers by overlapping gratings. There are four sets of overlapping gratings to measure the x-offset and another four sets of overlapping gratings to measure the y-offset. The four sets of gratings, which are measured by a spectroscopic reflectometer, have offset biases of 0, ¼, ½, ¾-pitch. GE880210 does not use a model that accounts for the diffraction of light by the gratings or the multiple scattering of the light by the two gratings, and it has no provision to handle non-rectangular line profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,150,231, Muller et al. teach measuring overlay by Moire patterns. The Moire pattern is formed by overlapping gratings patterns, one grating on the lower level, another on the upper level. The two grating patterns have different pitches. The Moire pattern approach requires imaging the overlapping gratings and estimating their offset from the spatial characteristics of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,023,338 and 6,079,256, Bareket teaches an alternative approach in which two complementary periodic grating structures are produced on the two subsequent layers that require alignment. The two periodic structures are arranged adjacent to and in fixed positions relative to one another, such that there is no overlap of the two structures. The two gratings are scanned, either optically or with a stylus, so as to detect the individual undulations of the gratings as a function of position. The overlay error is obtained from the spatial phase shift between the undulations of the two gratings.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Smith et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,395 and Ono in U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,473 teach aligning a wafer and a mask by using overlapping diffraction gratings and measuring higher order, i.e. non-specular, diffracted light. One diffraction grating is on the wafer and another one is on the mask. The overlapping gratings are illuminated by a normally incident light and the intensities of the positive and negative diffracted orders, e. g. 1st and −1st orders, are compared. The difference between the intensities of the 1st and −1st diffracted orders provides a feedback signal which can be used to align the wafer and the mask. These inventions are similar to the International (PCT) Application Publication No. WO 02/065545 A2 in that they use overlapping gratings on two layers. However, the U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,395 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,473 patents are applicable to mask alignment but not to overlay metrology. They do not teach how to obtain the quantitative value of the offset from the light intensity measurements. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,200,395 and 4,332,473 are not applicable to a measurement system that only uses specular, i.e. zeroth-order diffracted light.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">WO 02/065545 A2 teaches measuring overlay by scatterometry. Measurements of structural parameters of a diffracting structure from optical characterization are now well known in the art as scatterometry. With such methods, a measurement sample is illuminated with optical radiation, and the sample properties are determined by measuring characteristics of the scattered radiation (e.g. intensity, polarization state, or angular distribution). A diffracting structure consists of one or more layers that may have lateral structure within the illuminated and detected area, resulting in diffraction of the reflected (or transmitted) radiation. If the lateral structure dimensions are smaller than the illuminating wavelengths, then diffracted orders other than the zeroth order may all be evanescent and not directly observable. But the structure geometry can nevertheless significantly affect the zeroth-order reflection, making it possible to make optical measurements of structural features much smaller than the illuminating wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one type of measurement process of WO 02/065545 A2, a microstructure is illuminated and the intensity of reflected or diffracted radiation is detected as a function of the radiation's wavelength, the incidence direction, the collection direction, or polarization state (or a combination of such factors). Direction is typically specified as a polar angle and azimuth, where the reference for the polar angle is the normal to the wafer and the reference for the azimuth is either some pattern(s) on the wafer or other marker, e.g. a notch or a flat for silicon wafers. The measured intensity data is then passed to a data processing machine that uses some model of the scattering from possible structures on the wafer. For example, the model may employ Maxwell's equations to calculate the theoretical optical characteristics as a function of measurement parameters (e.g. film thickness, line width, etc.), and the parameters are adjusted until the measured and theoretical intensities agree within specified convergence criteria. The initial parameter estimates may be provided in terms of an initial “seed” model of the measured structure. Alternatively, the optical model may exist as pre-computed theoretical characteristics as a function of one or more measurement parameters in tabular form, i.e. a “library”, that associates collections of parameters with theoretical optical characteristics. The “extracted” structural model has the structural parameters associated with the optical model which best fits the measured characteristics, e.g. in a least-squares sense.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Conrad (U.S. Pat. No. 5,963,329) uses scatterometry to measure the line profile or topographical cross-sections. The direct application of Maxwell's equations to diffracting structures, in contrast to non-diffracting structures (e.g. unpatterned films), is much more complex and time-consuming, possibly resulting in either a considerable time delay between data acquisition and result reporting and/or the need to use a physical model of the profile which is very simple and possibly neglects significant features.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Scheiner et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,985) teaches a measurement method that is similar to that of Conrad, except that Scheiner's method uses a simplified, approximate optical model of the diffracting structure that does not involve direct numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. This avoids the complexity and calculation time of the direct numerical solution. However, the approximations inherent in the simplified model make it inadequate for grating structures that have period and line width dimensions comparable to or smaller than the illumination wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternative method taught by McNeil et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,867,276) the calculation time delay is substantially reduced by storing a multivariate statistical analysis model based on calibration data from a range of model structures. The calibration data may come from the application of Maxwell's equations to parameterized models of the structure. The statistical analysis is applied to the measured diffraction characteristics and returns estimates of the parameters for the actual structure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The measurement method taught by McNeil et al. uses diffraction characteristics consisting of spectroscopic intensity data. A similar method can also be used with ellipsometric data, using ellipsometric parameters such as tan ψ and cos Δ, in lieu of intensity data. For example, X. Niu in “Specular Spectroscopic Scatterometry in DUV Lithography,” Proc. <i>SPIE </i>3677, pp. 159 (1999), uses a library approach. The library method can be used to simultaneously measure multiple model parameters (e.g. linewidth, edge slope, film thickness).</p>

The disclosed method first constructs a “reference database” based on a priori information about the refractive index and film thickness of underlying films, e.g. from spectroscopic ellipsometry or reflectometry. The reference database has “diffracted light fingerprints” or “signatures” (either diffraction intensities, or alternatively ellipsometric parameters) corresponding to various combinations of grating shape parameters. The grating shape parameters associated with the signature in the reference database that matches the measured signature of the structure are then reported as the grating shape parameters of the structure.</p>

An optical instrument illuminates all or part of the target area and measures the optical response. The instrument can measure transmission, reflectance, and/or polarization of the illumination and detected light. Overlay error or offset between those layers containing the test gratings is determined by a processor programmed to calculate an optical response for a set of parameters that include overlay error, using a model that accounts for diffraction by the gratings and interaction to the gratings with each others' diffracted field. The model parameters might also take account of manufactured asymmetries. The calculated and measured responses are iteratively compared and the model parameters changed to minimize the difference.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Methods and apparatus based on optical homodyne displacement interferometry, OCDR, and optical interferometric imaging are disclosed for overlay, alignment mark, and CD metrologies that are applicable to microlithography applications and IC and mask fabrication and to the detection of defects in unpatterned and patterned wafers and masks. The metrologies may also be used for example in advanced APC, in determination of WIS, and in the determination of OPC.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With optical homodyne displacement interferometry, conjugated quadratures of optical fields generated by reflection/scattering of measurement beams by patterns on wafers and masks are measured interferometrically for the four different metrologies. The relative phases of the measured conjugated quadratures are used, i.e. analyzed and/or inverted, to obtain information about the relative locations of features for overlay error determination, alignment mark position determination, and CD determination and for other properties of pattern features.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With OCDR which is based on white-light interferometry, the intensity of an electrical interference signal generated by the detection of coherently mixed reference and reflected/scattered measurement beams from patterns on wafers is measured as a function of optical path length of the measurement beam and/or the reference beam. The resulting intensity function is analyzed for information about the locations of an array of features comprising the patterns. In addition, other properties of the conjugated quadratures, e.g. values of differential conjugated quadratures, are measured as required as a function of scattering angle of respective reflected/scattered beams and inverted to obtain information about properties of features of the patterns relevant to overlay error, alignment mark position, and CD determination such as asymmetries in the features caused by CMP.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The measurement beams of certain embodiments may exhibit at the features of the patterns and at defects far-field properties using a low numerical aperture (NA) or high NA beam delivery system, evanescent-field properties using non-confocal imaging systems, and/or near-field properties using sub-wavelength apertures to generate the respective measurement beam. The measurement beam may comprise one or more components with different wavelengths in the IR, visible, UV, VUV, and EUV in one or more states of polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The high precision of the overlay metrology system of at least some embodiments does not require the analysis of fields of beams generated by one or more reflections/scatterings by each of two stacked gratings such as in prior art. The associated analysis of the fields of beams generated by one or more reflections/scatterings by each of two stacked gratings is generally more complex and lengthy. In comparison, the analysis of the relative phase information may involve a simple determination of displacements corresponding to a particular phase shift value or a spectral analysis such as a fast Fourier transform (FFT) for high precision results. The inversions of the phase information, intensity profiles such as obtained in OCDR, and of the other properties of the conjugated quadratures are based on an iterative procedure using an application of scattering theory and an iteration of assumed feature properties.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Generally, speed of acquisition of phase information, speed of analysis of the phase information, and accuracy of information subsequently obtained with at least some embodiments exceeds in each of the three categories the corresponding performance based on the other properties of the conjugated quadratures that requires an inversion. Generally, speed of acquisition of the other properties of the conjugated quadratures, speed of inversion of the other properties of the conjugated quadratures, and accuracy of information subsequently obtained exceeds in each of the three categories the corresponding performance of prior art based on measurement and inversion of intensity properties of the corresponding reflected/scattered beams. Also, the speed of acquisition of the intensity profiles and the analysis of the intensity profiles generally exceeds in each of the two respective categories the corresponding performance of prior art based on measurement and inversion of intensity properties of the corresponding reflected/scattered beams.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At least some embodiments are is further distinct from prior art in that the techniques of linear displacement interferometry are used to obtain information about relative locations in three dimensions and properties of portions of patterns on a wafer or mask for the four different overlay, alignment mark, CD, and defect detection metrologies. In addition, at least some embodiments distinguish themselves from prior art by measuring other properties of the amplitudes and phases, i.e. differential properties of conjugated quadratures, of fields reflected/scattered by the portions of the patterns and inverting the measured other properties to obtain information about properties of portions of the patterns such as asymmetries caused by CMP. The prior art measures only intensities and/or ellipsometric properties of fields reflected and/or scattered by patterns and obtains information about overlay error of two patterns from properties of the measured intensities and/or ellipsometric properties.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At least some embodiments are distinct from prior art in that the high precision of the overlay metrology system does not require the analysis of fields of a beam generated by one or more reflections/scatterings by each of two stacked gratings such as in prior art.

In comparison, the analysis of the relative phase information of at least some embodiments may comprise a simple determination of relative displacements corresponding to a relative phase shift or to a particular phase shift value such as 2π or a spectral analysis such as a FFT to obtain high precision results.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The conjugated quadratures and differential conjugated quadratures are measured using interferometric techniques. Differential conjugated quadratures may be measured as a function of scattering angle in one or two dimensions, as a function of wavelength, and as a function of the polarization state of the measurement beam. The information about the relative location of a pattern may be with reference to a second pattern on the same interface layer of a wafer, to a second pattern on a different interface layer of the wafer, to a relative reference frame established by a simultaneous measurement of an array of conjugated quadratures corresponding to an array of sites on the wafer, or to a reference frame of a lithography or inspection stage metrology system.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At least some embodiments are also distinct from prior art in that the interferometric metrologies may use bi- or quad-homodyne detection techniques or variants thereof to obtain joint measurements of arrays of conjugated quadratures or differential conjugated quadratures of fields reflected/or scattered by defects and/or features of a wafer or a mask and the elements of arrays of the conjugated quadratures or differential conjugated quadratures are measured simultaneously leading to advantages of reduced sensitivity to vibrations and to a high throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, information about the properties of a feature or a defect with respect to the real and complex components n and k, respectively, of the refractive index may be obtained using different polarization states and/or wavelengths of measurement beams in the interferometric metrologies.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The procedures of at least some embodiments require general knowledge of the feature geometry of patterned wafers.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The lateral resolution used in detection of CD errors for features characterized by dimensions larger than the optical resolution used in the CD metrology can be matched respectively to the typical size of defects so as to maximize the respective detection efficiency and can also be matched to dimensions of subsections of features that is optimum for use of CD errors in OPC analysis. The precision to which such CDs are measured can be sub-nanometer, the profile of a surface can be measured to an accuracy of the order of 0.1 nm, and the mean size of particle defects detected and the size of dimensions of the subsections of features measured may be for example of the order of 35 nm for a VUV measurement beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0097" num="0123">In one group of embodiments of the present invention, selected portions of a wafer or mask are scanned by a displacement interferometric metrology system for a measurement of an error in an overlay, the location of an alignment mark, an error in a CD, or an error in another property. The presence of defects may introduce errors in the measurements made by the displacement interferometric metrology system wherein the defects may be for example in the form of either an error in the profile of an associated surface and/or an error in the form of a particle. After the measurements used in determining the errors in an overlay, the location of an alignment mark, the error in a CD, or an error in another property are obtained, an interferometric microscopy system, e.g. differential interferometric microscopy system, may be used in an end use application to determine if there are defects present whose affects must be accounted for. The sensitivities of the results of the scan by the displacement interferometric metrology system and the subsequent measurements to determine the forms of errors are different with respect to each other. As a consequence, the results of the scan by the displacement interferometric metrology system and the subsequent measurements can be inverted if required and the nature with respect to form of each error determined. The differential interferometric microscopy systems may comprise either an interferometric confocal or interferometric non-confocal microscopy system.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0124">In a second group of embodiments of the present invention, there are two complete independent scans of selected portions of a wafer or mask. The first scan of the selected portions of the wafer or mask is made using for example a differential interferometric microscopy system for the detection of defects in the forms for example of either an error in the profile of an associated surface and/or an error in the form of a particle. The first scan is followed by the second scan of the portions of the wafer or mask by a displacement interferometric metrology system for measurements relevant to an error in an overlay, to location of an alignment mark, to an error in a CD, or to an error in another property. The results of the two scans are processed in the same manner as that of the first group of embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0125">The embodiments of the second group of embodiments generally require a longer time for completion of an inspection of selected portions of a wafer or mask with a concomitant reduction in throughput. However, the second group of embodiments may offer the better overall throughput when the inspection for errors in overlay, for locations of alignment marks, for errors in CDs, and for errors in the another property and inspection for defects are used in APC.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0126">Embodiments of the interferometric systems will first be described for embodiments comprising an interferometric confocal microscopy system with embodiments of interferometric non-confocal microscopy systems subsequently described.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0127">In the four interferometric metrology system embodiments and the OCDR system embodiment, an imaging system may be used in the generation of measurement beams, in the imaging of a wafer, a mask or a substrate, and/or in the generation of reference beams. The imaging systems may be used in either a confocal configuration or a non-confocal configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0128">A general description is first given for the point spread function of an imaging system that may be used in the four interferometric metrology system embodiments and the OCDR system embodiment to image spots or sites comprising features of a measurement object or comprising sub-wavelength apertures used when generating near-field probe beams and detecting near-field return measurement beams.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Point Spread Function</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0129">The point spread function is generally designed so that the interferometric metrology system embodiments yield relative phases of measured conjugated quadratures that are robust with respect to small displacements of a detector element in the image plane of the imaging system. The image comprises fields of measurement beams reflected/scattered by features at an array of the spots on a measurement object. Each of the spots comprises an array of one or more sub-wavelength elements. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the imaging system of a linear displacement interferometric metrology system is represented by an imaging system indicated by element number <b>610</b> comprising a single lens element <b>620</b>. Also shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the location of a single element comprising for example a Porro type prism element or measurement object <b>510</b>. The complex amplitude U(P) in the image plane at point P with coordinates (x, y) for a source in the object space at point P<sub>0 </sub>with coordinates (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>) is given by the equation</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0133">The features of a spot comprising a single feature element or an array of elements forming a grating used in overlay, alignment mark, and CD metrology systems generally comprise high aspect ratios with respect to element lengths and separations. This property is used to advantage by specifying the pupil of the imaging system to be rectangular in cross-section with the boundaries of the rectangle aligned with the boundaries of the elements and selecting the aspect ratio of the rectangle to optimize performance of the linear displacement interferometric metrology system.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0134">The use of a pupil that is rectangular in cross-section makes it possible to decouple the properties of the measured conjugated quadratures of the fields reflected/scattered by the elements with respect to the ξ and η coordinates. As a consequence, it is simpler to optimize a design of an imaging system in the linear displacement interferometric metrology system and makes it possible to achieve a better performance with respect to signal-to-noise ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0135">The component of a measurement beam that is generated by reflecting/scattering a measurement beam by the elements will generally comprise two components, a backscattered component and a forward scattered component. The conjugated quadratures of the backscattered component are measured interferometrically and accordingly, the phase of the conjugated quadratures contains information about the location of the array of elements in one or more of the x, y, and z directions.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0136">Two procedures may be used to measure the backscattered component generated. One procedure is to restrict the range of values in ξ in Eq. (1) to eliminate both the forward reflected/scattered component and to either limit the contribution to the measured conjugated quadrature to a single diffraction order from the arrays of elements comprising more than one element or in the case of an array comprising a single element, to prevent the generation of undesired contributions to the reflected/scattered component by multiple reflections between widely separated elements.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0137">Another procedure is to not eliminate the contribution of forward reflected/scattered component in the measured conjugated quadratures but to restrict the range of values in ξ in Eq. (1) to either limit the contribution to the measured conjugated quadrature to a single diffraction order from the arrays of elements comprising more than one element or in the case of an array comprising a single element, to prevent the generation of undesired contributions to the reflected/scattered component by multiple reflections between widely separated elements. The contributions of the forwarded/scattered components and the backscattered component are separated in the another procedure by the use of a form of phase sensitive detection such as described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/816,172 (ZI-51) wherein both are entitled “Apparatus and Method for Measurement of Fields of Forward Scattered/Reflected and Backscattered Beams by an Object in Interferometry” and both of which are by Henry A. Hill. The contents of both the provisional and non-provisional patent applications are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0138">The subsequent general description of the properties in the image plane of a linear displacement interferometric metrology system will be restricted to the first procedure wherein the range of values in ξ is restricted, i.e. ξ<sub>2</sub>&gt;ξ<sub>1 </sub>and ξ<sub>1</sub>≧0 and ξ<sub>2 </sub>and ξ<sub>1 </sub>selected to either limit the contribution to the measured conjugated quadrature to a single diffraction order from the arrays of elements comprising more than one element or in the case of an array comprising a single element, to prevent the generation of undesired contributions to the reflected/scattered component by multiple reflections between widely separated elements.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0139">In the case of the array of elements comprising more than one element, i.e. the characteristic size of the spot being imaged is larger than the pitch of the array, the diffracted reflected/scattered beam will be preferentially diffracted at a particular set of angles. For a given optical wavelength λ for a measurement beam, the particular set of angles at which a spatial frequency component of the substrate reflected/scattered beam by the spot will diffract the beam is given by a grating equation

<p id="p-0124" num="0150">The properties of the measurement and reference beams are described in the context of specific embodiments of the present invention. However, it is appropriate to describe here a general property of at least some embodiments of the present invention that is achieved through the design of the reference beams used in the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems. The general property is that the reference beam is generated with properties such that the phase Φ of conjugated quadratures corresponding to the interference cross-term in the electrical interference signal values between the reference beam and the reflected/scattered measurement beam from a given Porro type prism element or feature generated by detection of mixed output beams of the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems has no dependence on either x or y.</p>

Eqs. (17) and (18) represent a condition that is met in at least some embodiments and accordingly, the general property is a property of those embodiments. However, other embodiments may also be configured so as to not implement the general property without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.

<p id="p-0128" num="0154">This is an important feature since the phase represented in conjugated quadratures is a function only of the reflecting properties and location of the Porro type prism element or feature in addition to a fixed offset error in the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems. A corollary statement is that the accuracy to which the location of a surface of an open or filled transparent feature can be measured is not affected by displacements of a pinhole corresponding to a detector or of a detector pixel used in measuring the respective conjugated quadratures.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0155">The spots on the wafer that are being examined may contain a single pattern element or an array of two or more pattern elements in the form for example of a grating. It is beneficial to further describe the application of aspects of the present invention to the two cases from a pedagogical perspective and because the respective processing of measured conjugated quadratures can be formally different in certain aspects.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Location of an Alignment Mark: Single Element Type</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0156">The measurement of an error in an overlay, a location of an alignment mark, or an error in a CD in a spot comprising a single pattern feature is based in part on a linear displacement interferometric measurement wherein the measurement and/or the reference object comprises a Porro type prism element such as described in commonly owned U.S. Provisional patent applications Ser. No. 60/568,774 (ZI-60), Ser. No. 60/569,807 (ZI-61), and Ser. No. 60/573,196 (ZI-63) and the corresponding U.S. patent application (T.B.D.) (ZI-63) filed May 6, 2005 wherein all four are entitled “Apparatus And Methods For Measurement Of Critical Dimensions Of Features And Detection Of Defects In UV, VUV, And EUV Lithography Masks” and each are by Henry A. Hill. The contents of each of the four cited applications are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference. The Porro type prism element or a measurement and/or reference object is formed by two partially reflecting surfaces of an open or filled transparent feature in the mask or wafer which may be contiguous or spatially separated. The two partially reflecting surfaces of the Porro type prism element are nominally orthogonal with respect to each other but may be at some other angle in a given end use application, e.g. 60 degrees or 80 degrees, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0157">An example of the measurement and/or reference object comprising the Porro type prism element is shown diagrammatically as element <b>510</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. Element <b>510</b> comprises two surfaces, a partially reflecting horizontal surface <b>520</b> forms one of the two reflecting surfaces and one of the partially reflecting nominally vertical surfaces of a feature in a mask <b>530</b> forms the second of the two reflecting surfaces. The feature comprises surface elements <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, and <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0158">A defect in the reflecting substrate <b>520</b> in the form of a foreign particle will introduce an error in inferred position of the measurement object in addition to the error introduced by an error in either the profile of surface <b>520</b> and/or in a respective CD associated with surfaces <b>530</b> and <b>540</b>. Thus a detected error in the relative locations of respective surfaces of a feature forming a Porro type prism element may be due to either an error in the physical location one or both of the respective feature surfaces and/or due to the presence of a defect, e.g. a particle or an error in the height profile of a surface, within the feature. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine the feature with a different diagnostic tool in order to isolate the contribution of an error in a CD to the linear displacement measurement, i.e. if there is detected an error in the apparent location of a Porro type prism element or measurement object formed by boundaries of an open or filled transparent feature, a check may be required to eliminate the possibility that a defect exists in the horizontal surface profile or in the form of a particle in the interior of the feature that may be generating the detected error in part or in whole.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0159">The different diagnostic tool comprises a differential interferometric confocal and/or an interferometric non-confocal microscopy system preferentially operating in a dark field mode. The differential interferometric microscopy systems may in addition be used to detect defects in any one of the reflecting surfaces of a mask, i.e. a reflecting substrate, the surface of a buffer, the surface of a phase-shifting layer, and/or the surface of an absorber at different points in the fabrication of the mask.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0160">A CD corresponding to the spacing between two opposing walls of an open or filled transparent feature are measured when using the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems by comparing the respective locations of the respective Porro type prism elements formed by the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the open or filled transparent feature. Thus the measurement of the CD is a differential technique. As a consequence, the value of the measured CD is independent of the refractive indices of the media forming the surfaces of the open or filled transparent feature.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0161">The pitch of a parallel array of elongated features corresponding to the spacing of corresponding walls of two contiguous open or filled transparent features are measured using the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems by comparing the respective locations of the respective Porro type prism elements formed by the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the open or filled transparent features of the array of elongated features. Thus the measurement of the pitch is a differential technique. As a consequence, the value of the measured pitch is independent of the refractive indices of the media forming the surfaces of the open or filled transparent features when the open or filled transparent features are identical or substantially the same with respect to composition.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0162">The calibration of the pitch scale is based on the use of a reference or standard parallel array and/or on the use of a stage metrology system. The accuracy of a pitch measurement will depend in part on the accuracy to which the surface profile of the array of horizontal reflecting surfaces of the open or filled transparent features are measured or known. The profile can be measured.</p>

<p id="p-0143" num="0169">Therefore for example, the measurement of the phase Φ<sub>m </sub>to an accuracy of 6 milliradian for a λ=200 nm and a Λ=100 nm would yield a relative position accuracy of 0.1 nm mod Λ for the portion of the grating in the spot. The displacement redundancy of Λ is a consequence of the phase redundancy of 2π in Φ<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Measurement of Grating Pitch Λ</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0170">The average pitch Λ of the portion of the grating in the spot is measured as the change in displacement x<sub>0 </sub>that will produce a 2π phase shift in Φ<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Location of an Alignment Mark: Grating Type</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0171">The relative location of an alignment mark is determined by first scanning the respective portion of wafer corresponding to the alignment mark with two different alignment mark metrology system configurations and recording the respective displacements of x<sub>0 </sub>as a function of Φ<sub>m</sub>. The values of θ<sub>I </sub>and θ<sub>D </sub>for the two different configurations of the interferometric imaging system of the alignment mark metrology system are equal in magnitude, respectively, but have opposite signs, respectively. The displacements in x<sub>0 </sub>are measured by the stage metrology system of the lithography tool for which information about the location of the alignment mark is being determined. It is assumed herein that the performance with respect to accuracy of the lithography stage metrology system matches the accuracy required to meet the accuracy of the overlay budget of the lithography tool/specific process.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0172">The location of the alignment mark is obtained as the average value of the two measured values of x<sub>0 </sub>if the spot contains a single scattering element and the average value of x<sub>0 </sub>mod Λ if the spot contains a portion of a grating. The offset error in the case of the spot containing a single scattering element is calibrated by using a pair of Porro type prism elements on a calibration wafer separated by a distance larger than the size of the spot and the separation of the two Porro type prism elements measured by an independent procedure. The independent procedure may be based for example on measurements with a scanning Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0173">The removal of the redundancy with respect to Λ is achieved by incorporating one or more additional gratings wherein the relative values of the pitches of the additional gratings form for example a geometric progression, i.e. 1,2,4,8, . . . , and the locations of each of the additional gratings are determined mod respective values of pitch. The number of additional gratings (N−1) required for each of two coordinate system axes will be determined by the ratio of the linear dimension of the spot to Λ. Accordingly, N≧3 based on the domain expressed in Eq. (21).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0174">The measurements of the respective values of x<sub>0 </sub>and corresponding values of Φ<sub>m </sub>are obtained simultaneously for the one or more gratings and as a consequence, the additional measurements required to remove the pitch redundancy does not affect the throughput of the respective lithography tool.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0175">The area required for the alignment mark and the additional gratings is approximately ≧(Nλ)<sub>x</sub>(Nλ)<sub>y</sub>/3 depending on the linear dimensions of the spot where the subscripts refer to the x and y axes of a coordinate system. For the example of λ=200 nm and N=4, the area required for the alignment mark and additional gratings is approximately 0.05 (μm)<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Relative Location of Two Gratings Located on Same Process Layer of Wafer</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0176">The relative location of two gratings located on the same process layer of a wafer is determined by scanning the respective portions of wafer corresponding to the two gratings and recording the spatial separation in x<sub>0 </sub>that corresponds to a change in Φ<sub>m </sub>mod 2π. The relative location of the two gratings corresponds to the measured spatial separation in x<sub>0 </sub>mod Λ. The pitch redundancy generally will not present a problem when the measured separation mod Λ is used in an overlay metrology system. If however it is desired to remove the pitch redundancy, an array of additional gratings may be used in the manner described herein in the section entitled “Location Of An Alignment Mark: Grating Type” for the removal of the pitch redundancy encountered in the alignment mark determination.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0177">If the profile of the wafer surface is not flat, there will be an error introduced in the measured spatial separation in x<sub>0 </sub>mod Λ. The sensitivity function ∂Φ<sub>m</sub>/∂z<sub>0 </sub>is obtained from Eq. (19) with the result</p>

The values of θ<sub>I </sub>and θ<sub>D </sub>for the two different configurations of the interferometric imaging system of the metrology system are equal in magnitude, respectively, but have opposite signs, respectively. The displacements in x<sub>0 </sub>are measured by the stage metrology system of the lithography tool for which information about the location of the alignment mark is being determined.

If however it is desired to remove the pitch redundancy, an array of additional gratings may be used in the manner described herein for the removal of the pitch redundancy encountered in the alignment mark determination in the section entitled “Location of an Alignment Mark; Grating type”.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0185">The relative location of the two gratings is obtained as the average value of the two measured values of x<sub>0 </sub>if the spots each contain a single scattering element and the average value of x<sub>0 </sub>mod Λ if the spots each contain a portion of a grating.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0186">There may be an offset error as a result of the affect of imaging of a spot interior of the wafer in each of the two scans of the wafer.

The degree to which the offset errors cancel out can be checked by adapting the procedure described herein in the section entitled “Location of an Alignment Mark: Grating type” for spots comprising a single scattering element. In this case, the independent procedure can be for example based on a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0187">A higher level of cancellation of the offset error can be achieved by using a set of an even number of gratings on one process layer and an odd number of gratings on the second process layer with the gratings on the two process layers interleaved transversely such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>i. </i></p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0191">The relative location of superimposed gratings such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>j </i>is determined by measurement of other properties of the conjugated quadratures, e.g. values of differential conjugated quadratures as a function of scattering angle of respective reflected/scattered beams and inverting the measured quantities to obtain information about the relative location of the superimposed gratings.

The inversion procedure is based on a rigorous treatment of scattering and iterating the assumed properties of the superimposed gratings until the computed other properties of the conjugated quadratures matches the measured other properties of the conjugated quadratures to a requisite level.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0192">The rigorous treatment of scattering includes the affects of fields of beams generated by one or more reflections/scatterings by each of two stacked gratings.</p>

<p id="p-0169" num="0195">The procedure based on the measurement of phases is the preferred procedure when there is a choice between the two procedures. The procedure based on measurement of phases generally is generally more accurate, less sensitive to assumed properties of a pattern, does not require extensive inversion analyses, and leads to a higher throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0196">The procedure based on the measurement of phases is generally an option when the pattern under measurement is etched into a multilayer stack comprising two or more layers and the reflection properties of the different layers is different for s and p polarization states of measurement beams.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0197">The pitch Λ of a portion of a grating, a CD of a pattern feature, or the spacing between two distinct gratings is measured using s and p polarization states of the measurement beam. The affect of WIS will be to introduce an asymmetry in the respective patterns by altering the top layer or layers of the multilayer stacks. Accordingly, the asymmetry will introduce a difference in the pitch Λ of a portion of a grating, a CD of a pattern feature, or the spacing between two distinct gratings is measured using s and p polarization states of the measurement beam. Information about the affect of WIS can be determined from the measured difference by taking into account the different reflectivities of the layers with respect to state of polarization of the measurement beam. The most accurate information about the affect of WIS is obtained when the affect of WIS is confined to a single top layer.</p>

The arrays of measurement beams are focused on and/or in measurement object <b>60</b> and arrays of return measurement beams are generated by reflection/scattering by measurement object <b>60</b>. The arrays of reference beams and return measurement beams are combined by a beam-splitter to form one or two arrays of output beams using measurement beams that comprise a single polarization state or two orthogonal polarization states, respectively. The arrays of output beams are mixed with respect to state of polarization either in interferometer <b>10</b> or in detector <b>70</b>. The arrays of output beams are subsequently focused to spots on pixels of a multipixel detector and detected by a quantum detection process to generate the array of electrical interference signals <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0214">The conjugated quadratures of fields of return measurement beams are obtained by using a single-, double-, bi-, quad-homodyne detection method or variant thereof. The bi- and quad-homodyne detection methods are described for example in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/765,368 (ZI-47). The variants of the bi- and quad-homodyne detection methods are described for example in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/816,180 (ZI-50).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0215">For the single-homodyne detection method, input beam <b>24</b> comprises a single frequency component and sets of four or eight measurements of the array of electrical interference signals <b>72</b> is made in non-ellipsometric or ellipsometric measurements, respectively. For each of the measurements of the array of electrical interference signals <b>72</b> in non-ellipsometric and ellipsometric measurements, known phase shifts are introduced between each reference beam component and respective return measurement beam component of output beam <b>34</b>. The subsequent data processing procedure used to extract the conjugated quadratures of fields of beams reflected and/or scattered by a substrate is described for example in commonly owned U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0190" num="0216">The double-homodyne detection method which is applicable to non-ellipsometric measurements uses input beam <b>24</b> comprising four frequency components and four detectors to obtain measurements of electrical interference signals that are subsequently used to obtain conjugated quadratures in non-ellipsometric measurements. Each detector element of the four detector elements obtains a different one of the four electrical interference signal values with the four electrical interference signal values obtained simultaneously to compute the conjugated quadratures for a field. Each of the four electrical interference signal values contains only information relevant to one orthogonal component of the conjugated quadratures. The double-homodyne detection used herein is related to the detection methods such as described in Section IV of the article by G. M D'ariano and M G. A. Paris entitled “Lower Bounds On Phase Sensitivity In Ideal And Feasible Measurements,” <i>Phys. Rev</i>. A 49, pp 3022-3036 (1994). Accordingly, the double-homodyne detection method does not make joint determinations of conjugated quadratures of fields wherein each electrical interference signal value contains information simultaneously about each of two orthogonal components of the conjugated quadratures.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0217">In the adaptation of the double-homodyne detection method to ellipsometric measurements, input beam <b>24</b> comprises eight frequency components and eight detectors to obtain measurements of eight electrical interference signals that are subsequently used to obtain conjugated quadratures. Each detector element of the eight detector elements obtains a different one of the eight electrical interference signal values with the eight electrical interference signal values obtained simultaneously to compute the conjugated quadratures of fields of scattered/reflected orthogonally polarized fields. Each of the eight electrical interference signal values contains only information relevant to one orthogonal component of one of the two conjugated quadratures.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0218">The bi- and quad-homodyne detection methods obtain measurements of electrical interference signals wherein each measured value of an electrical interference signal contains simultaneously information about two orthogonal components of conjugated quadratures. The two orthogonal components correspond to orthogonal components of conjugated quadratures such as described in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/765,368 (ZI-47).</p>

<p id="p-0267" num="0293">If the profile of the wafer surface is not flat, there will be an error introduced in the measured location of features in the scan direction. The profile of the wafer surface is measured by the use of a differential interferometric confocal and/or an interferometric non-confocal microscopy system preferentially operating in a dark field mode. The differential interferometric microscopy systems are such as described herein in the section entitled “Differential Interferometric Microscopy Systems.” The differential interferometric microscopy systems may in addition be used to detect defects at either of the two sites. The measured profile and the sensitivity function ∂Φ<sub>m</sub>/∂z<sub>0 </sub>given by Eq.

<p id="p-0269" num="0295">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that there are other embodiments of the present invention comprising apparatus of the described embodiments of the present invention that within the same instrument, the required measurements and analyses for overlay, the alignment mark, the CD metrology systems can be achieved without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0296">Embodiments of the present invention can be extended to operate not only into the VUV but also into the EUV. This is achieved by the use of pellicle type beam-splitters such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/948,959 (ZI-56) and self supporting beam-splitters such as described by T. Haga, M. C. K. Tinone, M. Shimada. T. Ohkubo, and A. Ozawa in a article entitled “Soft x-ray multilayer beam splitters,” <i>J. Synchrotron Rad</i>., 5, pp 690 (1998). The description herein of techniques used in source <b>18</b> and beam-conditioner <b>22</b> for the generation of UV and VUV measurement and reference beams also can be used to generate EUV measurement and reference beams.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0297">For the extension of operation of at least some the embodiments of the present invention into the EUV, a beam combining beam-splitter in a respective interferometric imaging system with a beam combining thin fluorescent layer or interface may be beneficially used such as described in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/948,959 (ZI-56). The use of a fluorescent layer impacts on the performance specifications required of optical elements and/or detector that follow the beam combining function to achieve a certain end use performance. The thin fluorescent layer, e.g. lumogen, absorbs light at one wavelength, e.g. the UV, VUV, or EUV and emits light at a longer wave length, e.g. in the visible. Thus there is a concomitant reduction in the required performance specifications of the subsequent optical elements because the subsequent optical elements serve only to transmit beams and generate optical images at the longer wavelength instead of at the shorter wavelength beam.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Differential Interferometric Microscopy Systems</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0298">The differential interferometric microscopy systems of the confocal and non-confocal type are used in at least some embodiments of the present invention. The embodiment of the present invention that comprises a differential interferometric confocal microscopy system is the same as the differential interferometric confocal microscopy system described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/816,180 (ZI-50). The differential interferometric confocal microscopy system is configured to operate in a dark field mode preferably and compares interferometrically the properties of two transversely separated sections of an open or filled feature of a mask, patterned wafer, or an unpatterned wafer. If the properties of the two transversely separated sections are identical as the mask, patterned wafer, or unpatterned wafer is scanned, there will be no change in the measured conjugated quadratures. However, if at a certain location on the mask or patterned wafer, there is a difference in the two interferometrically compared sections, there will be a change in the measured conjugated quadratures.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0299">The difference in properties may be in the form of a surface profile, widths of the two sections, depths of the two sections, or a particle located on the surface or in one of the two sections. A difference in the two widths will generate a difference in the amplitudes of the beams scattered by the entrance plane aperture formed by the feature sections. A difference in the depths of the two sections or the presence of a particle located in one of the two sections will modify the properties of the leaky guided wave modes that are excited in the features by the respective measurement beams. The description of the excited leaky guided wave modes and the fields radiated by the excited leaky guided wave modes is the same as described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/765,254 (ZI-46), entitled “Leaky Guided Wave Modes Used in Interferometric Confocal Microscopy to Measure Properties of Trenches,” by Henry A. Hill and incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0300">The sensitivity of the change in measured conjugated quadratures to changes in CDs and to depths are measured using independent measurements of the CDs or a simplified inversion analysis. The inversion analysis is simplified as a consequence of the primary measurements being differential. Detailed knowledge of the reflecting properties of two sections that are being compared interferometrically is required when the composition of the two sections are materially different. Because of the high level of modal structure of masks and patterned wafers, a detailed knowledge of the mask and patterned wafer structure is not required in the location of errors in CDs.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0301">A differential interferometric non-confocal is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is the same as the description given for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>except with respect to measurement beam <b>24</b>A. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, measurement beam <b>24</b>A is incident on measurement object <b>60</b> with an angle of incidence that is nominally zero. The primary difference between the information obtained about the open or filled transparent features using the confocal and non-confocal interferometric microscopy systems is with respect to the properties of the leaky guided wave modes that are excited.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0302">Information is obtained about the surface profile or the horizontal surface of an open or filled transparent feature or features with a reduced lateral spatial resolution and a reduced depth discrimination of the incident measurement beam for the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system. However, there is an advantage with the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system in that the amplitudes of the excited guided wave modes will generally be larger for the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system as compared to the corresponding confocal system. Another advantage for the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system is that the orders of the excited guided wave modes will generally comprise a smaller set as compared to the corresponding confocal system.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0303">Thus the information obtained about errors in surface profiles, CDs, depths, and the presence of defects in the form of particles from the confocal and the non-confocal interferometric microscopy systems are complimentary and will impact on the selection of one or the other of the confocal or non-confocal systems in an end use application.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0304">In another embodiment of the present invention, the confocal and non-confocal interferometric microscopy systems are combined in a single interferometric microscopy system. The another embodiment comprises the apparatus of the confocal interferometric microscopy system and a beam delivery system for the measurement beam that switches the measurement beam <b>24</b>A between a slit-array <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>f </i>and <b>2</b><i>c</i>) and to object <b>60</b> with a nominal zero angle of incidence.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0305">Other embodiments of the present invention are described wherein joint measurements are obtained of the conjugated quadratures of fields of complimentary measurement beams reflected/scattered by defects of a measurement object. The complimentary measurement beams correspond to two measurement beams that have orthogonal states of linear polarization. The other embodiments comprise the apparatus of embodiments described in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/816,180 (ZI-50) and the apparatus and procedures of the first embodiment described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0306">In yet other embodiments of the present invention, the interferometric metrology systems may be configured to obtain information in the form of joint and non-joint measurements about the angular distribution of the reflected/scattered beams by defects in measurement objects. The yet other embodiments comprise the apparatus described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/938,408 (ZI-54) for the acquisition of information about angular distributions.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0307">Many of the embodiments of the present invention can be configured for operation in the transmission mode consistent with properties of the mask or wafer for which alignment mark, overlay, and/or CD information is required.

<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Interferometric Microscopy Systems: Near- and Evanescent-Field Probe Beams</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0308">Other embodiments of the present invention may be configured to operate with measurement beams that have the properties of a near-field or an evanescent field at the wafer. Evanescent fields are generated by selecting the angle of incidence θ<sub>2 </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>) of the measurement beams at the plane surface of plano-convex lens <b>258</b> to be greater than that required to produce total internal reflection and the separation h≦λ/4 such as described in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/866,010 (ZI-52) and Ser. No. 10/948,959 (ZI-56). The angle of incidence may be selected by the relative locations of apertures used in a mask such as mask <b>114</b>B of the third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0309">The non-oblique measurement beams at substrate <b>60</b> may be in the form of near-fields when an array of transmitting sub-wavelength apertures is located on the plane surface of plano-convex lens <b>258</b> and the separation h≦λ/4 such as described in cited U.S. Pat. No. 6,445,453 (ZI-14).</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0310">The information obtained with other embodiments of the present invention has for example the high sensitivities of an interferometric metrology system to vertical displacements of a surface and to asymmetries at a site on a wafer. The high sensitivities of interferometric metrology systems based on use of near- or evanescent-field measurement beams lead to high accuracies in overlay, alignment mark, CD metrology systems, and defect detection. The complexity of inversion procedures used in the overlay, alignment mark, and CD metrology systems based on a rigorous treatment of scattering is generally reduced because the patterns on the wafer under measurement need not be overlapping in order to obtain the desired information with required accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0311">The interferometric metrology systems described above can be especially useful in alignment mark identification on a stepper or scanner of lithography applications used for fabricating large scale integrated circuits such as computer chips and the like and in a stand-alone metrology system for measuring CD and overlay performance of the stepper or scanner. The interferometric metrology systems described above can also be especially useful in inspection of masks used in the stepper or scanner and in the inspection of wafers at different stages of the fabrication of large-scale integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0312">Lithography is the key technology driver for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In particular, overlay improvement is one of the five most difficult challenges down to and below 100 nm line widths (design rules), see, for example, the <i>Semiconductor Industry Roadmap</i>, pp 82 (1997). Since a lithography tool may produce $50-100M/year of product, the economic value from improving (maintaining) performance of the lithography tool is substantial. Each 1% increase (loss) in yield of the lithography tool results in approximately $1M/year economic benefit (loss) to the integrated circuit manufacturer and a substantial competitive advantage or disadvantage to the lithography tool vendor.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0313">Overlay is measured by printing one pattern on one level of a wafer and a second pattern on a consecutive level of the wafer and then measuring, on a stand-alone metrology system, the difference in the position, orientation, and distortion of the two patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0314">A stand-alone metrology system for measuring overlay comprises a microscope system for viewing the patterns, such as the catadioptric imaging systems described above, connected to laser gauge-controlled stage for measuring the relative positions of the patterns, and a wafer handling system.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0315">The function of a lithography tool is to direct spatially patterned radiation onto a photoresist-coated wafer. The process involves determining which location of the wafer is to receive the radiation (alignment) and applying the radiation to the photoresist at that location.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0316">To properly position the wafer, the wafer includes alignment marks on the wafer that can be measured by dedicated sensors such as the interferometric metrology systems described above. The measured positions of the alignment marks define the location of the wafer within the tool. This information, along with a specification of the desired patterning of the wafer surface, guides the alignment of the wafer relative to the spatially patterned radiation. Based on such information, a translatable stage supporting the photoresist-coated wafer moves the wafer such that the radiation will expose the correct location of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0317">During exposure, a radiation source illuminates a patterned reticle, which scatters the radiation to produce the spatially patterned radiation. The reticle is also referred to as a mask, and these terms are used interchangeably below. In the case of reduction lithography, a reduction lens collects the scattered radiation and forms a reduced image of the reticle pattern. Alternatively, in the case of proximity printing, the scattered radiation propagates a small distance (typically on the order of microns) before contacting the wafer to produce a 1:1 image of the reticle pattern. The radiation initiates photo-chemical processes in the resist that convert the radiation pattern into a latent image within the resist.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0318">When a mask is made, it must be perfect. Any defects in the pattern will destroy the functionality of the semiconductor circuit that is printed with that mask. Before a mask is delivered to the semiconductor manufacturing line, it is passed through an automated mask inspection system that searches for any defects in the pattern. There are two possible strategies in mask inspection, known as die-to-database and die-to-die inspection. The first method involves an automated scanning microscope or an interferometric metrology system described herein that compares the mask pattern directly with the computer data used to generate the mask. This requires a very large data handling capability, similar to that needed by the mask writer itself. Any discrepancy between the inspected mask pattern and the data set used to create it is flagged as an error. The interferometric metrology systems described above are especially well suited for automated mask inspection with its advantages in background reduction and in the substantially simultaneous acquisition of one-dimensional line section images and two-dimensional section images.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0319">In general, the lithography system, also referred to as an exposure system, typically includes an illumination system and a wafer positioning system. The illumination system includes a radiation source for providing radiation such as ultraviolet, visible, x-ray, electron, or ion radiation, and a reticle or mask for imparting the pattern to the radiation, thereby generating the spatially patterned radiation. In addition, for the case of reduction lithography, the illumination system can include a lens assembly for imaging the spatially patterned radiation onto the wafer. The imaged radiation exposes resist coated onto the wafer. The illumination system also includes a mask stage for supporting the mask and a positioning system for adjusting the position of the mask stage relative to the radiation directed through the mask. The wafer positioning system includes a wafer stage for supporting the wafer and a positioning system for adjusting the position of the wafer stage relative to the imaged radiation. Fabrication of integrated circuits can include multiple exposing steps. For a general reference on lithography, see, for example, J. R. Sheats and B. W. Smith, in <i>Microlithography: Science and Technology </i>(Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1998), the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

These steps are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>b </i>and <b>7</b><i>c</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>is a flow chart of the sequence of manufacturing a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor chip (e.g. IC or LSI), a liquid crystal panel or a CCD.

<p id="p-0299" num="0325">Step <b>854</b> is a wafer process, which is called a pre-process wherein, by using the so prepared mask and wafer, circuits are formed on the wafer through lithography. To form circuits on the wafer that correspond with sufficient spatial resolution those patterns on the mask, interferometric positioning of the lithography tool relative the wafer is necessary. The catadioptric imaging systems described herein can be especially useful to inspect the surface of the wafer and internal layers generate on the wafer by wafer processing to check and monitor the effectiveness of the lithography used in the wafer process.
