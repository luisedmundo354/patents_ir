<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A vacuum canister includes a storage space and a removable lid. The lid includes a pump housing that defines a pumping chamber within which a sliding piston is disposed. The piston is connected to a handle via a piston rod and features a skirt-like piston valve that seals against the side wall of the pump housing when the piston travels downward but permits air to pass when the piston travels upward. Air is pumped from the canister storage space via the pump. A vacuum indicator and release valve are also positioned in the lid. A bellows communicates with the canister storage space and contracts when a vacuum is present. The bellows is connected to a lever which pivots to extend a button indicating the presence of the vacuum. Pushing the button causes the lever to engage a vacuum release valve.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to containers for storing food items and other perishables and, more specifically, to an improved vacuum canister.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Food, beverages and other perishable items are typically stored in containers such as bottles or canisters. The perishable items stored in such containers, however, deteriorate over time due to air that remains in the container after the container is covered for storage with a lid or cover. The air often contains moisture which further deteriorates the canister contents. Such deterioration may also diminish the natural aroma of the perishable item. In order to prevent such spoilage, it is known to provide vacuum canisters that feature pumps for removing most of the air from the interior of the canister after it is sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to removing air from the interior of the canister, the vacuum assists in maintaining the seal between the canister and the canister lid. As a result, prior art vacuum canisters also typically include a release valve so that the vacuum in the canister may be released prior to removal of the canister lid. In addition to featuring a pump and a vacuum release valve, a number of prior art vacuum canisters feature a vacuum indicator so that the user knows when air has been evacuated from the canister.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of a prior art vacuum canister is presented in U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,632 to Hsieh et al. The container of the Hsieh et al. '632 patent includes a lid with a built-in pump. More specifically the lid features a button in its top that, when depressed, forces a piston downwards in a pumping chamber. The piston is connected to the button by a piston rod containing a conduit that leads from the pumping chamber to the exterior of the container. As a result, when the button is pressed down, air below the piston travels out of the pumping chamber through the piston rod conduit to the exterior of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, as the piston of the Hsieh et al. '632 patent moves downward, air from the interior of the container enters the portion of the pumping chamber above the piston through a one-way valve. When the button is released, the piston travels upward due to the force exerted by a compression spring. As the piston travels upward, the air above the piston travels through holes in the periphery of the piston, past an O-ring, to the portion of the pumping chamber below the piston. The downward pumping stroke of the button may then be repeated. The O-ring seals the holes in the periphery of the piston, and also seals the gap between the periphery of the piston and the pumping chamber wall, during the downward pumping stroke so that air may only escape the portion of the pumping chamber below the piston through the piston rod conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the pumping system of the Hsieh et al. '632 patent works well, the creation of the multiple holes in the periphery of the piston increases manufacturing complexity and costs as does the O-ring seal and the piston rod conduit. In addition, the holes may become clogged or otherwise obstructed which would adversely effect pumping performance. A further disadvantage of the container of the Hsieh et al. '632 patent is that it does not feature a vacuum indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As mentioned previously, a number of prior art vacuum containers provide vacuum indicators. An example of such a container is presented in U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,282 to Chen et al. In addition to including a vacuum pump, the lid features a bellows with an open bottom end that is in communication with the interior of the container. A compression spring is positioned within the bellows and urges the upper end of the bellows upwards out of an aperture formed in the top surface of the lid. As a result, when air has not been evacuated from the container, the upper end of the bellows protrudes up from the top surface of the lid. When air has been evacuated from the container, however, the resulting vacuum pulls the upper end of the bellows down into the aperture so that the presence of the vacuum is indicated to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The container of the Chen et al. '282 patent also includes a vacuum release valve for releasing the vacuum in the container so that the container lid may be easily removed. The valve includes knob which, when pressed downwards, unseats an O-ring so that the interior of the container is permitted to communicate with the surrounding atmosphere through an aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While both the vacuum indicator and release valve of the container of the Chen et al. '282 patent work well, it would be advantageous to combine their functions into a single device. Such an approach would streamline the appearance of the container. In addition, operation of the device would be simplified and more intuitive as users may often instinctively press in on the vacuum indicator of the Chen et al. '282 patent expecting to release the vacuum instead of searching for a separate release valve.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved vacuum canister that features a pumping mechanism that is durable and easy to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved vacuum canister with a vacuum indicator that indicates when air has been evacuated from the canister.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved vacuum canister with a vacuum indicator that also functions as a vacuum release valve.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved vacuum canister that is simple and economical to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is directed to a vacuum canister for storing perishable items. The canister includes a body having an open top and defining a storage space with a lid removably covering the open top of the body. A pump housing is positioned within the lid and defines a pumping chamber that selectively communicates with the atmosphere and the storage space via exhaust and intake passages, respectively, that are formed in the lid. A piston is slidably positioned within the pumping chamber and has a pump handle attached thereto via a piston rod. A compression spring is positioned between the pump housing and the bottom of the piston and urges the piston upward.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A skirt-like piston valve is positioned around the periphery of the piston and seals against the pump housing when the piston is moved downward. Air is permitted to pass between the periphery of the piston and the pump housing when the piston is moved upward. As a result, air is transferred from the storage space to the pumping chamber via the intake passage while air is simultaneously expelled from the pumping chamber to the atmosphere via the exhaust passage as the piston travels downward. A filter and an intake check valve are positioned within the intake passage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The canister also features a vacuum indicator and release valve that includes a bellows positioned within the lid with an open bottom in communication with the storage space so that the bellows contracts when air is evacuated from the storage space. A compression spring is positioned within the bellows and urges it into the expanded configuration. A button is also positioned in the lid and is slidable between an extended position and a retracted position. A venting passage is formed in the lid between the storage space and the atmosphere with a vacuum release valve positioned therein. A lever is pivotally mounted within the lid and includes a first end attached to the top of the bellows and a second end engaging the release valve and the button so that when the bellows contracts, the lever places the button in the extended position and the vacuum release valve seals the venting passage. Pressing the button when in the extended position opens the vacuum release valve so that the vacuum in the storage space is released through the venting passage.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An embodiment of the improved vacuum canister of the present invention is indicated in general at <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The canister features a body <b>12</b> that is open at the top and which receives a lid <b>14</b>. As will be explained in greater detail below, the lid is equipped with a pump that is operated by pressing and releasing pump handle <b>16</b> in a repetitive fashion. The lid also features a button <b>18</b> that, as will also be explained in greater detail below, indicates when air has been evacuated from the canister via the pump. The button may also be pressed to release the vacuum within the canister so that lid <b>14</b> may be easily removed from the canister body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, canister body <b>12</b> encloses and defines a storage space <b>22</b> within which food, beverages or other perishable items may be stored. The canister lid, indicated in general at <b>14</b>, features a top shell <b>24</b> and a bottom shell <b>26</b> that are joined. The canister lid also features a circumferential gasket <b>28</b>, constructed of plastic, rubber or an alternative sealing material, that engages the open top edges <b>30</b> of the canister body <b>12</b> in a removable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Positioned between the top and bottom shells of the lid <b>14</b> is a pump housing, indicated in general at <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Pump housing <b>32</b> defines a pumping chamber <b>34</b>. A piston <b>36</b> is slidably positioned within the chamber <b>34</b>. A piston rod <b>44</b> is connected to the piston by its lower end <b>46</b> and to pump handle <b>16</b> by its upper end <b>48</b>. The piston rod passes out through the top of pump housing <b>32</b> via opening <b>50</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A skirt-like piston valve <b>38</b> formed of rubber, flexible plastic or the like is positioned around the periphery of the piston <b>36</b> and engages the inner surface <b>40</b> cylindrical side wall <b>42</b> of the pump housing. More specifically, the skirt-like configuration of the piston valve <b>38</b> causes it to seal against the inner surface <b>40</b> of side wall <b>42</b> when the piston <b>36</b> is traveling downward, however, air may pass between the piston valve <b>38</b> and the inner surface <b>40</b> of the side wall when piston <b>36</b> is traveling upward.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A compression spring <b>52</b> positioned between the bottom shell <b>26</b> of the lid and the bottom <b>54</b> of the piston urges piston <b>36</b> upward towards the position indicated in phantom at <b>56</b>. As a result, when handle <b>16</b> is pressed, piston <b>36</b> travels down from its initial resting position <b>56</b> to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When handle <b>16</b> is released, spring <b>52</b> moves piston <b>36</b> from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> back up to its initial resting position <b>56</b>. A recess <b>58</b> is formed in the top portion of upper shell <b>24</b> to accommodate handle <b>16</b> when it is pressed in. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> and <b>5</b> illustrate the preferred position for compression spring <b>52</b>, it could be placed in a variety of alternative positions, such as between the handle <b>16</b> and the top panel <b>74</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the pump housing or the top shell <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an opening <b>62</b> is formed in the bottom shell <b>26</b> of the lid. The opening <b>62</b> leads to an intake passage <b>64</b> within which filter <b>66</b> is positioned. An intake check valve <b>68</b> is also positioned within the passage <b>64</b> and permits air to enter the pumping chamber <b>34</b> through an opening <b>72</b> formed in the top panel <b>74</b> of the pump housing <b>32</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated at <b>76</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, an aperture <b>76</b> is formed in the bottom of the pump housing <b>32</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the aperture leads from the pumping chamber <b>34</b> to an exhaust passage <b>82</b> which opens to the atmosphere via a gap <b>84</b> between the handle <b>16</b> and the top shell <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in operation, piston <b>36</b> travels down through pumping chamber <b>34</b> as pump handle <b>16</b> is pressed down. The sealing between the piston valve <b>38</b> and the pump housing wall <b>42</b> causes air in the portion of the pumping chamber beneath the piston to be expelled through aperture <b>76</b>, through passage <b>82</b> and out to the atmosphere through gap <b>84</b>, as illustrated by arrow <b>86</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The downward travel of piston also causes suction to occur above the piston so that air is withdrawn from the interior storage space <b>22</b> of the canister along the path illustrated by arrow <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. More specifically, the air travels from the storage space <b>22</b> through opening <b>62</b> and is filtered through filter <b>66</b> as it travels through passage <b>64</b>. The air then continues through intake check valve <b>68</b> and into the portion of the pumping chamber <b>34</b> above the piston <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described previously, when pump handle <b>16</b> is released, piston <b>36</b> travels upward to the position illustrated in phantom at <b>56</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As a result, as illustrated by arrow <b>94</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, air in the portion of the pumping chamber above the piston is forced between the piston valve <b>38</b> and interior surface <b>40</b> of pump housing wall <b>42</b> to the portion of the pumping chamber below the piston by the action of check valve <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the upward travel of the piston. The pump handle <b>16</b> is then pressed down again to exhaust the air beneath the piston from the canister.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As a result, repetitive pressing and releasing of the pump handle removes air from the storage space <b>22</b> of the canister so that a vacuum is formed. This causes the contents of the canister to remain fresher for an extended period of time and also strengthens the seal between the lid <b>14</b> and the canister body.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A vacuum indicator and release valve assembly, indicated in general at <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is provided to indicate when air has been evacuated from the canister and to permit the vacuum to be released when it is desired to remove the lid <b>14</b> from the canister. The assembly includes a lever <b>104</b> that is pivotally mounted in the lid <b>14</b> via pin <b>106</b>. One end of the lever includes a hook <b>108</b> to which the top end <b>112</b> of a bellows <b>114</b> is connected. A compression spring <b>116</b> is positioned within the bellows and urges the bellows into the expanded configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The end of the lever <b>104</b> opposite hook <b>108</b> engages button <b>18</b> and a valve member <b>118</b>. Button <b>18</b> is slidable between the retracted position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and an extended position indicated in phantom at <b>122</b>. A valve compression spring <b>122</b> surrounds valve member <b>118</b> and urges it upward. The lower end of valve member <b>118</b> is provided with an O-ring <b>124</b> which engages and seals an opening <b>126</b> due to the action of spring <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The bottom end <b>132</b> of the bellows <b>114</b> is open and is fitted over a conduit <b>134</b> which communicates with the storage space <b>22</b> within the canister via a passage <b>136</b> and an opening <b>138</b> formed in the bottom shell <b>26</b>. As a result, when air is evacuated from canister storage space <b>22</b>, it is also withdrawn, as indicated by arrow <b>142</b>, from the interior of bellows <b>114</b> through conduit <b>134</b>, passage <b>136</b> and opening <b>138</b>. This causes the bellows to contract against the action of spring <b>116</b>. As a result, the top end <b>112</b> of the bellows is lowered so that the lever <b>104</b> pivots clockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As lever <b>104</b> travels clockwise, the end opposite of the hook end <b>108</b> forces button <b>18</b> to slide outwards into the position indicated in phantom <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, thus indicating the presence of a vacuum in the canister. In addition, when the lever <b>104</b> has pivoted in the clockwise direction due to a vacuum in the canister storage space <b>22</b>, valve member seals opening <b>126</b> via O-ring <b>124</b> and the action of compression spring <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When it is desired to release the vacuum in the canister so that the lid <b>14</b> may be removed, button <b>18</b> is pressed so that it is returned to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As the button slides inward, it causes lever <b>104</b> to pivot counterclockwise so that valve member <b>118</b> is forced downward by the end of lever <b>104</b>. This causes the O-ring <b>124</b> to become unseated from opening <b>126</b>. As a result, air from the atmosphere travels into the canister storage area <b>22</b> through gap <b>144</b>, venting passage <b>146</b> and opening <b>126</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>152</b>. In addition to releasing the vacuum within the canister storage space <b>22</b>, this permits spring <b>116</b> to urge the bellows <b>114</b> back into the extended configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so that lever <b>104</b> is maintained in the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> which retains the button <b>18</b> in the retracted position indicating the absence of a vacuum within the canister.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined by the appended claims.</p>
