<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system incorporating a robot to inspect ferrous surfaces. Preferably, the robot is an articulated device having a tractor module for motive power and steering, a power module for electrical power and communications and additional motive power, and a third module for cleaning and inspection. The robot uses sensors and generates and transmits signals to a computer through a tether and receives direction from an operator via the computer and tether. The computer continuously monitors the location of the robot and supports the robot during deployment. In a specific application, the robot travels the interior of a tank on a set of magnetized wheels. Prior to inspection, the tank surface is cleaned of deposits by rotary cutters and rotary brushes on the third module. The robot obtains thickness measurements via onboard ultrasonic transducers that contact the cleaned surface. A method for implementing inspection of ferrous surfaces is also described.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Under 35 U.S.C § 121, this application claims the benefit of prior co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/553,613, now abandoned Apparatus That Accesses a Ferrous Surface That Is Inconvenient to Access in Order to Measure and Assess the Condition Thereof, by Hock et al., filed Apr. 20, 2000, and is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, many tanks used for the underground storage of liquids have been made of fiber reinforced synthetic resins, and so will not rust or otherwise degrade over time. Traditionally, storage tanks were made of steel, thus these tanks can corrode to the point of perforation. Once corrosion has caused perforation, tank contents leak into the ground and gradually leach into nearby underground aquifers. Replacement or repair of these tanks to correct the damage involves extensive effort and attendant expense. In the United States, approximately 700,000 underground storage tanks are estimated to be in service. Most store petrochemicals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) enforces regulations that protect against dangers inherent in defective underground storage tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">40 CFR §§ 280 et seq. requires that new underground storage tanks (USTs) meet stringent standards and that all existing USTs be certified to be within specified tolerances for leak resistance integrity. Certification of existing tanks requires that the tanks in current service be inspected to determine whether they meet the applicable federal standard. Traditional methods for inspection of USTs require access into the tank by a worker to visually assess the surface. For a person to enter a UST, sometimes a portion of the earth covering a tank must be excavated and the stored liquid removed. Excavation is laborious and even after the liquid removal potentially toxic residual fumes remain in the tank, especially-in tanks storing petrochemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After an UST has been inspected and certified under 40 CFR §§280 et seq., a cathodic protection system may be required to reduce subsequent tank corrosion, extend tank life, and comply with updated Federal standards.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One example of a remotely controllable, self-propelled vehicle for inspecting the interior of USTs is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,405 to Schempf et al. The '405 patent describes a mobile vehicle having endless drive tracks that are selectively magnetically actuated during travel on the inner surfaces of a UST. As its endless drive tracks are driven in one direction, a clutch is intermittently engaged to cause a hollow shaft to rotate to intermittently activate a magnetic circuit. The vehicle is capable of climbing a vertical wall and traveling in an inverted orientation in a ferrous structure by utilization of its magnetic tracks. It is able to enter and operate in a tank that is filled with liquid and carries a camera and an ultrasonic tester. The vehicle has its basic components enclosed in a hermetically sealed and pressurized compartments to prevent explosion of the stored liquid and to keep the liquid from seeping into the electrical and mechanical parts. It is able to communicate signals indicative of its findings to an external computer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The '405 vehicle is equipped with acoustic means facilitating navigation within an enclosed structure containing a liquid. Calibration of the navigational system is necessary when operating in multiple fluid types since sound travels at different speeds in materials of different densities. While ultrasonic transducers used by the'405 vehicle facilitate measurement of wall thickness without determining a fixed point of reference, deployment of ultrasonic sensors alone to measure thickness to assess corrosive condition may be unreliable in an underground storage tank environment. Particular frequency readings may be affected by causes unrelated to wall thickness. For example, readings may be compromised by equipment operator produced sounds or vehicles traveling nearby. Another source of error may be unknown amounts of corrosive buildup on the tank surface. The'405 vehicle incorporates no means to remove accumulated rust or sediment before measuring wall thickness. Thus a need exists for a mobile device to travel within a liquid filled tank to measure and report actual tank wall thickness by performing the necessary tasks for making reliable measurements to include removing any corrosive buildup prior to measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, a need exists for the remote inspection of ferrous structures other than underground storage tanks. These other structures include bridges, building frames, utility towers and the like. Select embodiments of the present invention address such applications.</p>

The power module <b>24</b> is connected to and followed by a cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is shown in transition from the interior surface of a cylindrical wall <b>12</b> upwards onto the interior surface of an end plate <b>14</b>A. Travel of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> within the UST <b>10</b> is enabled by use of motor driven magnetic wheeled axle assemblies as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, showing the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> in side elevation and top plan views, respectively. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> may be deployed both vertically and horizontally. For example, the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> is designed to pivot in either an upward or downward direction only. The tractor module <b>22</b> is designed to pivot only laterally to the left or right. Since the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is operative in various orientations, e.g., horizontal mode with wheels facing down, inverted horizontal mode with wheels facing up, and vertical mode as occurs on the end plates <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B; relative movement of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> will be described from the perspective of the horizontal mode with wheels facing down unless otherwise noted. In the horizontal mode, the horizontal plane is referred to as the X-Z plane, and its two mutually orthogonal vertical planes are the X-Y and Z-Y planes. Sealing of the housing of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> against leakage is accomplished by use of an RTV silicone compound between stationary parts and with O-rings for sealing shafts that move through housing walls. Once the housing of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is sealed, a pressurized gas, such as air or nitrogen, is introduced to the interior of the housing to prevent seepage of liquid into the housing. The tractor module <b>22</b> is flexibly assembled and connected to the power module <b>24</b> by a vertical front pivot joint <b>34</b> including a pin <b>84</b>. This arrangement facilitates angular flexure between the tractor module <b>22</b> and the power module <b>24</b> only in the X-Z plane. The cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> is assembled and connected to the power module <b>24</b> by a horizontal rear pivot joint <b>44</b>. The rear pivot joint <b>44</b> enables angular flexure between the power module <b>24</b> and the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> only in the vertical planes X-Y and Z-Y.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrating the power module <b>24</b> as constructed with a forward segment <b>80</b>, a middle segment <b>90</b>, and a rear segment <b>96</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, electrically energized, reversible motors <b>92</b> and <b>110</b> drive various functions in the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows the connections of these motors <b>92</b>, <b>110</b> to tractor <b>22</b> and cleaning and inspecting module <b>26</b>. The middle segment <b>90</b> contains the motor <b>110</b> that generates and transmits drive power to the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>. Power is transmitted from the motor <b>110</b> to the magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> by means of a drive shaft <b>112</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the drive shaft <b>112</b> includes a telescoping universal joint (not shown separately) at its transition to a drive mechanism housed in the tractor module <b>22</b>. The forward end of the shaft <b>112</b> connects to a gear reducer <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) located in the tractor module <b>22</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the gear reducer <b>30</b> drives the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> through the chain <b>31</b> and the sprocket <b>70</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the motor <b>92</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) and other electric apparatus in the body of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> are powered at 24 volts DC. Use of DC power permits reversing the direction of drive without the added circuitry typically required with use of AC motors. In select embodiments of the present invention, small, reversible, high-speed electric motors are used in conjunction with worm and wheel type gear reducers (not shown separately) to conserve space. Typically, in select embodiments of the present invention, the worm and wheel type gear reducers are each immersed in an oil bath. In select embodiments of the present invention, the electric motors <b>92</b>, <b>110</b> that drive the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> meet the design specification requirement of 30 lbf. of power per wheel <b>32</b>, based on a system force balance analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In select embodiments of the present invention, a shaft <b>40</b> is actuated to pivot the tractor module <b>22</b> laterally about pin <b>84</b> relative to the power module <b>24</b> to accomplish steering. In select embodiments of the present invention, the shaft <b>40</b> is moved linearly by a linear actuator (not shown separately) formed by the lead screw motor <b>106</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the shaft <b>40</b> is configured to pass to the front end of the power module <b>24</b> and connect to the coupling <b>38</b> on the tractor module <b>22</b>, thereby causing the tractor module <b>22</b> to change its direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The middle segment <b>90</b> of the power module <b>24</b> houses a reversible, electric motor <b>98</b> that supplies power through a worm and wheel gear reducer <b>102</b> (in the rear segment <b>96</b> ) to the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b>. Via the reducer <b>102</b>, the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> is caused to rotate at the same speed and in the same direction as the forward magnetized wheel axle assembly <b>32</b>. An incremental encoder (not shown separately) having a digital output communicates with the rear wheel drive motor <b>98</b> to obtain odometric data. In some applications of select embodiments of the present invention, a degree of slippage between the magnetized wheel asemblies <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> and the surface of operation may occur, thus affecting the odometer reading. Thus, position verification may be accomplished by an operator (not shown separately) or by a computer <b>100</b> when the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> contacts a known fixed object, e.g., within the UST <b>10</b> this may be an end wall <b>14</b>A, B. Thus, the occurrence of slippage does not preclude maintaining reasonably accurate real-time information regarding the position of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>. Another encoder (not shown separately), operable in a manner similar to that of the first encoder, may communicate with the drive for the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>, thereby improving reported positional accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 6</figref>. The motor <b>98</b> drives a shaft <b>108</b> that communicates with a gear reducer <b>133</b> that drives a sprocket <b>132</b> through a worm wheel (not shown separately) mounted on the pivot shaft <b>44</b>. A chain <b>134</b> connects the drive sprocket <b>132</b> to drive the sprocket <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B</figref>, <b>3</b>B, C, and <b>7</b>. The sprocket <b>136</b> is mounted to provide power to the rotary cutters <b>124</b>A, B and brushes <b>126</b> A, B of the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b>. The motor <b>92</b> is housed in the forward segment <b>80</b> for supplying linear power to the lead screw <b>93</b>. The lead screw <b>93</b> operates linearly to contact and move the push rod <b>48</b>, in turn, causing the transition lever arm <b>46</b> to pivot so as to lift the front end of the tractor module <b>22</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The lead screw <b>93</b> is aligned with the push rod <b>48</b> when the tractor module <b>22</b> is aligned with the power module <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In summary, the drive motors are: the motor <b>92</b> to drive the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>; the motor <b>98</b> to drive the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> and the cutters <b>124</b>A, B and brushes <b>126</b>A, B of cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b>; the motor <b>106</b> to drive the steering function of the tractor module <b>22</b>; and the motor <b>110</b> to activate the lifting function of the transition lever arm <b>46</b> and the rear push rod <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, B, C. The tractor module <b>22</b> includes the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> that is driven by a two-stage reduction drive. The front drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> is mounted to the tractor module <b>22</b> far forward so as to protrude from the body of the tractor module <b>22</b> in a forward direction of travel. The front drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> is also tucked within the substantially round body of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to limit the cross sectional size thereof to enable entry through a riser <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Typical risers have a diameter of four inches. As the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> moves along the surface of the UST <b>10</b>, loose particles of oxidized iron (rust) adhere to the contacting surfaces of the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>. Thus, in select embodiments of the present invention, a pair of scrapers <b>36</b>A, B, preferably of a corrosion resistant material such as stainless steel, are mounted on the body of the tractor module <b>22</b> so that an edge of each presses against the cylindrical surface of the drive wheels <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> of the front magnetic wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>, dislodging particles that accumulate thereon. The scrapers <b>36</b>A, B are mounted to permit dislodging when the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is operating in either direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the directional rod <b>40</b> that connects to the coupling <b>38</b> through the clevis <b>41</b> operates to turn the tractor module <b>22</b> in the plane of travel only. A shaft <b>40</b> communicates linearly with the power module <b>24</b> in a direction parallel to the long axis of the power module <b>24</b> to cause the tractor module <b>22</b> to pivot about the pivot joint <b>34</b>. A coupling <b>38</b>, preferably formed with a slot that is substantially perpendicular to the long axis of the tractor module <b>22</b>, permits the shaft <b>40</b> to move without restriction.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, B, C, depicting a pair of contact sensors, <b>50</b>A, B mounted on the front left and right front corners of the tractor module <b>22</b>. Each contact sensor <b>50</b>A, B communicates with a contact switch (not shown separately), preferably digital, that generates a signal in response to the leading outer surface of either contact sensor <b>50</b>A, B contacting something. The contact sensors <b>50</b>A, B are mounted on the telescoping supports <b>52</b> configured to collapse into the tractor module <b>22</b> upon a corresponding sensor <b>50</b>A, B contacting something. The degree of telescoping allows the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> to touch and magnetically grip a surface perpendicular to the surface on which the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is traveling prior to contact. Contact by both sensors <b>50</b>A, B simultaneously is interpreted by the computer <b>100</b> as a contact with a perpendicular surface. Contact by only one of the sensors <b>50</b>A, B indicates a less than perpendicular relationship between robotic vehicle <b>20</b> and the contacted surface. In select embodiments of the present invention, maximum adhesive force for the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> is achieved by contact with the surface along a tangent across the face and parallel to the axis of the drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>. Thus, it is preferred that the tractor module <b>22</b> contacts the surface for transition, e.g., transition from a cylindrical wall <b>12</b> to and end plate <b>14</b>A, perpendicularly. With the initial data from the contact sensors <b>50</b>A, B as to the relative angle of contact of the tractor module <b>22</b>, correction is made through program control by the computer <b>100</b> to achieve perpendicular approach. Attaining perpendicularity is accomplished by moving the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> backwards from the contacted surface and making additional approaches to achieve approximately simultaneous contact by sensors <b>50</b>A, B.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, C. For the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to perform a transition from one surface to another approximately perpendicularly disposed, it is necessary to first separate the drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> from the current surface of travel. Separation is accomplished by actuation of the transition lever arm <b>46</b> pivotally mounted at the pivot <b>46</b>. Alternate mechanisms, such as a linearly actuated push rod also accomplish this function. The transition lever arm <b>46</b> is L-shaped, with its upper end <b>46</b>′ positioned adjacent the forward end of the push rod <b>48</b>. As the lead screw <b>93</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) pushes against the push rod <b>48</b>, the push rod <b>48</b> moves left (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). The actuation of the push rod <b>48</b> from its retracted position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) to its extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) forces the transition lever arm <b>46</b> to pivot about the pin <b>46</b>P counterclockwise as shown by the arrow K. The downward force of the transition lever arm <b>46</b> lifts the front of the tractor module <b>22</b> so as to separate the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> from the surface of the UST <b>10</b>. When the push rod <b>48</b> retracts, the cam <b>46</b> pivots back to its initial position with the aid of a biasing means, such as a spring <b>49</b> or the like. The push rod <b>48</b> is slidingly mounted in bearings (not shown separately) in the wall of the tractor module <b>22</b> and not physically connected to the lead screw <b>93</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). When the tractor module <b>22</b> is at an angle to the power module <b>24</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the push rod <b>48</b> is at a similar angle and not aligned with the lead screw <b>93</b>. Thus, it is necessary to put the tractor module <b>22</b> and the power module <b>24</b> in substantial alignment prior to actuating the transition lever arm <b>46</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a solenoid-actuated push rod <b>137</b> is positioned to lift the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> in a manner similar to the way that the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> is lifted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrating the axial configuration of the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>. The front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> is an assembly of five disk-like members <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> interspersed axially along a shaft <b>78</b>. The outer polar members <b>74</b>A, B are located toward the ends of the shaft <b>78</b>, respectively and the inner polar member <b>76</b> is centrally located along the shaft <b>78</b>. The polar members <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> are made of magnetically transmissive material, not adapted to permanently retain significant magnetic properties, such as a low carbon steel. Between each of the outer polar members <b>74</b>A, B and the inner polar member <b>76</b> is an axially polar magnetic member <b>72</b>, each formed of a permanently magnetic material. In select embodiments of the present invention, the axial magnetic members <b>72</b> are formed of rare earth materials, e.g., neodymium iron, and oriented such that their poles are opposite to one another, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. In this arrangement, magnetic flux M is radiated between magnetic members <b>72</b> through polar members <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> to establish a strong magnetic bond between the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> and the ferrous surface upon which it operates. The shaft <b>78</b> passes through the five members <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> and mounts the sprocket <b>70</b> to receive drive power from the chain <b>31</b>. The rear drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> is constructed similarly.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Due to the irregular interior surface of a typical UST <b>10</b> and the frequent occurrence of lumps, select embodiments of the present invention employ a tread pattern to improve traction of the magnetized drive wheeled axle assemblies <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>. Multiple grooves <b>79</b> are formed on the outer periphery of each polar member <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> in a direction approximately parallel to the shaft <b>78</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention there are six grooves <b>79</b> uniformly dispersed around each polar member <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the grooves <b>79</b> may be aligned one to another across the face of the three polar members <b>74</b>A,B, <b>76</b>, although a non-aligned pattern is also suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, B. Each polar member <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> is formed with a relatively large diameter D<sub>p </sub>and each magnetic member <b>72</b> with a relatively small diameter D<sub>m</sub>. The pattern of magnetic flux M is shown schematically as dashed lines from each magnetic member <b>72</b> through respective polar members <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> to a ferrous surface such as the tank wall <b>12</b>. This configuration enhances the flux pattern by causing it to intensify through the polar members <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b>. In addition, the large diameter polar members <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> protect the smaller diameter magnetic members <b>72</b> from damage due to wear or impact.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, B. With diameter D<sub>p </sub>of outer polar members <b>74</b>A, B and the inner polar member <b>76</b> being substantially equal, all polar members <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> are in contact with the interior surfaces <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>A, B of the cylindrical UST <b>10</b> in only two relative orientations of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>. One orientation occurs when operating on planar tank end plates <b>14</b>A, B and the other when operating circumferentially on the cylindrical wall <b>12</b>. When the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> operates along a path parallel to the long axis of the UST <b>10</b> or on a path at an angle between a “parallel axial” path and a circumferential path, the inner polar member <b>76</b> does not contact the surface. The maximum air gap G is typically small between the inner polar member <b>76</b> and the surface. Magnetic flux M travels across the gap to attract to a ferrous surface. For example, in the case of the UST <b>10</b> having a diameter of 2.4 meters (8 feet), and the front drive polar members (wheels) <b>74</b>A, B, <b>76</b> having a diameter of 5 cm (2 inches) and the length of the shaft <b>78</b> 5.6 cm (2.2 inches), the maximum air gap G between the periphery of the inner polar member <b>76</b> and the tank wall <b>12</b> is approximately 0.33 mm (0.013 inches). Larger diameter tanks <b>10</b> have a proportionally smaller gap G. In select embodiments of the present invention, the magnetized drive wheeled axle assemblies <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> produce a combined attractive force of 207 lbf. This is sufficient to support a robotic vehicle <b>20</b> of about 18 Kg (40 lbs).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, B illustrating a robotic vehicle <b>20</b> in assembled condition including three main modules <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>.

In select embodiments of the present invention, each segment <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>96</b> is built separately and assembled to the other segments so as to form the integrated power module <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrating the forward segment <b>80</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the forward segment contains an orientation sensor <b>86</b> that comprises three mutually orthogonal piezoresistive inclinometers (not shown separately). This type of inclinometer has a flexible beam, typically silicon material, supporting a mass at one end of each inclinometer. Each inclinometer is sensitive along one axis only. As the orientation of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> changes, the mass shifts in relation to the fixed end of the beam, causing the beam to bend. The silicon material changes in electrical resistance in proportion to strain, providing a property that can be readily measured and converted to an orientation reading. By feedback and analysis of signals received from each of the X, Y, and Z inclinometers, the computer <b>100</b> determines the yaw, pitch, and roll orientation of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>. Similarly, n select embodiments of the present invention, the computer <b>100</b> is able to detect a change in direction of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> as it travels the interior of the UST <b>10</b>.</p>

(HYTREL® and KEVLAR® are registered trademarks of E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company.) As noted above, the specific function and connection of the cables and tubes comprising the tether <b>28</b> are such as to be apparent to those skilled in the trade, and as such are not detailed further.
</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0106">In select embodiments of the present invention, the tether <b>28</b> is involved in the physical deployment into and retrieval of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> from the UST <b>10</b>; in supplying electric power to perform the motor drive operations, the ultrasonic inspection operation, and transmitting the orientation, travel, and communication signals; and in transmitting signals from the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to the computer <b>100</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> must drag a length of the tether <b>28</b> through the UST <b>10</b>, at times involving support of its catenary weight as the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> traverses the “roof” or end walls of the UST <b>10</b>. The tether <b>28</b> is typically 45 m. (150 ft.) in length. Thus, it is important to keep the weight of the tether <b>28</b> at a minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0107">In select embodiments of the present invention, the combination of the tractor module <b>22</b> and the power module <b>24</b> described above is operative for moving and controlling the movement of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> within the UST <b>10</b> by implementation of signals from the computer <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0108">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the identification of defects in the walls of a UST <b>10</b> is facilitated by the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b>. As described above, the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> is pivotally connected to the power module <b>24</b> at the horizontal pivot pin <b>44</b> with a first bar <b>114</b> pivotally mounted on either side thereof. The rear portion of each bar <b>114</b> is pivotally connected to module <b>26</b> at a rear pivot shaft <b>116</b>, positioned toward the rear portion of cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b>. The rear pivot shaft <b>116</b> mounts the fourth sprocket <b>136</b> and the third sprocket <b>132</b> involved in the transmission of power for the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b>. A pair of telescoping pressurized struts <b>118</b>, mounted to the shaft <b>115</b> at the back ends of the struts <b>118</b> and to the power module <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) at the front ends of the struts <b>118</b>, prevents the cleaning and inspection module from moving horizontally while limiting the degree to which the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> can pivot vertically in relation to the power module <b>24</b>. In select embodiments of the present invention, the struts <b>118</b> are of the telescoping cylinder type and are filled with nitrogen or other substantially inert gas. In select embodiments of the present invention, a supply of pressurized gas (not shown separately) may be connected to the struts <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0109">In select embodiments of the present invention as designed above, the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> is held in contact with the surface on which the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is traveling, regardless of the orientation of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>. The stop <b>120</b> mounted rigidly to the side of the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> allows the forward end of the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> to pivot down to a limited degree with respect to the first bars <b>114</b>. The tension springs <b>121</b> are assembled between the shaft <b>115</b> and a selected anchor point <b>117</b> on the housing of the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> to bias the module <b>26</b> in the counterclockwise direction in relation to an anchor point <b>117</b>. This bias pressure, in combination with the operation of the struts <b>118</b>, assures that the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> stays in intimate contact with the surface regardless of the orientation of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0110">In select embodiments of the present invention, the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> includes devices for scraping residue off the surface to be inspected. Power is transmitted to the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> from the third sprocket <b>132</b> on the power module <b>24</b> via the second chain <b>134</b> that is connected at its rear end to the fourth sprocket <b>136</b>. For the second chain <b>134</b> to connect between the pivotally connected power <b>24</b> and inspection and cleaning <b>26</b> modules, the chain engaging sprockets must be coaxial with the front <b>44</b> and rear <b>116</b> pivot points for the first bars <b>114</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the left (or front) end of the first bars <b>114</b> are assembled to the front pivot shaft <b>44</b> that is positioned in the rear segment <b>96</b> of the power module <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In select embodiments of the present invention, the fourth sprocket <b>136</b> is commonly mounted with the fifth driving sprocket <b>122</b> that is connected to the duplicate cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B. The forward cutting wheel <b>124</b>A and the rear cutting wheel <b>124</b>B and duplicate rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B are connected to the fifth sprocket <b>122</b> through a third drive chain <b>128</b>. The cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B are formed with a series of substantially sharp edges E spaced around the diameter thereof and extending across their widths. The cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B, especially the sharp edges thereof, are formed preferably of hardened steel or the like. The rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B are formed with a series of flexible bristles spaced around the diameter thereof and extending across their widths. In select embodiments of the present invention, the bristles of the brushes <b>126</b>A, B are of polymeric material. In select embodiments of the present invention, the cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B are mounted at the forward and rearmost ends of the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> and the two rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B are mounted therebetween. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cutting edges E of the forward cutting wheel <b>124</b>A are angled to cut when the forward cutting wheel <b>124</b>A rotates in the counterclockwise direction and the cutting edges E of the rear cutting wheel <b>124</b>B are angled to cut in the clockwise direction. The fifth sprocket <b>122</b> drives the cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B and the rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B via the third drive chain <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0111">An idler sprocket <b>130</b> is positioned substantially in the center of the third drive chain <b>128</b> and is adapted for adjustment to provide chain tension as needed. The third drive chain <b>128</b> is entrained in serpentine fashion around a series of sprockets (not shown separately) to cause the forward cutting wheel <b>124</b>A to rotate in a first direction and the rotary brush <b>126</b>A to rotate in an opposite direction. The same counter rotation occurs with the rear cutting wheel <b>124</b>B and the rotary brush <b>126</b>B. In select embodiments of the present invention, the cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B are rotated at a speed about three times faster than the speed of the drive wheeled axle assemblies <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> to effectively remove deposits. In select embodiments of the present invention, to assist the movement of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>, the cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B operate in the same rotational direction as the drive wheeled axle assemblies <b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, albeit faster.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0112">If a cutting wheel rotating in a direction opposite to the direction of travel were to encounter an obstacle such as a weld seam, a jam could occur. To avoid this type of jamming, in select embodiments of the present invention each cutting wheel <b>124</b>A, B is driven by use of a unidirectional clutch (not shown separately) to enable rotation in the selected drive direction only. In select embodiments of the present invention, a first unidirectional clutch mounted to the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> permits rotation thereof only in the counterclockwise direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) and a second unidirectional clutch mounted to the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> permits rotation thereof only in the clockwise direction. When the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> drives forward, with the tractor module <b>22</b> going first, the forward cutting wheel <b>124</b>A and both rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B operate. When the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> reverses, i.e., with the tractor module <b>22</b> trailing, the motor <b>110</b> for driving the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> and the motor <b>98</b> for driving the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> and the cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B are reversed, and the rear cutting wheel <b>124</b>B and both rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B operate. By rotating the rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B in the direction opposite to their adjacent respective cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B, the particles loosened by the cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B are removed from the path of travel of the ultrasonic sensor unit.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0113">In select embodiments of the present invention, one or more ultrasonic transducers (not shown separately) are encapsulated in a block <b>60</b> preferably formed of a dense, tough, and resilient material, such as an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene resin. This block <b>60</b> is positioned between forward rotary brush <b>126</b>A and rear rotary brush <b>126</b> B. The block <b>60</b> is biased downwardly to maintain firm contact with the operating surface for transmitting its sonic signal directly to the surface without having to broach an intervening gap. When the UST <b>10</b> is at least partially liquid filled, a lubricant layer exists between the block <b>60</b> and at least some of the tank's surface. In select embodiments of the present invention, when the tank is empty, ultrasonic transducer performance is enhanced and the wear on block <b>60</b> is minimized via use of a lubricating couplant liquid transmitted through the tube <b>281</b> in the tether <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In select embodiments of the present invention, the ultrasonic transducers are 2-10 MHz pulse echo transducers, adapted for determining wall thickness when coupled with appropriate analytic computer programming therefor. In select embodiments of the present invention, several 10-Mhz ultrasonic transducers are arrayed in a scan path width of about 2.5 cm. (1 inch). In select embodiments of the present invention, ultrasonic data from the transducers are processed with a commercially available program such as that available from INFORMATRICS TESTPRO or the like. In select embodiments of the present invention, the cutting wheels <b>124</b>A, B and rotary brushes <b>126</b>A, B operate either in forward or reverse travel of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> and engage the surface ahead of the transducers in the block <b>60</b>. This ensures a reasonably clean surface for reliable measurements. In select embodiments of the present invention, the ultrasonic transducers may make between approximately 30 and 100 measurements per second. At a speed of approximately 77 mm (3 inches) per second, measurements may be collected about every 0.77-2.6 mm (0.03-0.10 inches).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0114">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11F</figref> depicting a robotic vehicle <b>20</b> as it progresses in sequential steps from a first surface of the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> of an UST <b>20</b> to a second surface of a wall or end plate <b>14</b>A orthogonal thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0115">Assume the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is oriented substantially perpendicular to the surface to which it is transferring. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. Contact sensor <b>50</b>B and <b>50</b>A (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-D</figref>) contacts the end plate <b>14</b>A of the UST <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates a second step in the transition of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> from the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> to the end plate <b>14</b>A in which the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> continues to travel and press a leading outer surface of the contact sensors <b>50</b>A, B against end plate <b>14</b>A whereby contact sensors <b>50</b>A, B are telescoped to contact the body of the tractor module <b>22</b>. A signal, generated by a contact switch (not shown separately) communicating with the contact sensors <b>50</b>A, B, is transmitted to cause the transition lever arm <b>46</b> to pivot downwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. The transition lever arm <b>46</b> is pivoted downwardly by movement of the linear actuator <b>48</b> as described above. The transition lever arm <b>46</b> lifts the forward end of the tractor module <b>22</b> off the surface <b>12</b>. The transition lever arm <b>46</b> being connected at the location of the pin <b>46</b>P (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, C) moves the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> closer to the end plate <b>14</b>A during its pivoting action so that the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> efficiently makes magnetic contact with the end plate <b>14</b>A. During this transition period, the tractor module <b>22</b> is precluded from moving laterally with respect to the other two modules <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. The connection between the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b> and the power module <b>24</b> allows relative movement of these two modules <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> in the vertical direction only as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11C-E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0116">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11C-E</figref>. The front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> powers the front end of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> along the end plate <b>14</b>A as the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> continues to drive on the cylindrical wall <b>12</b>, further assisting the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to climb up the end plate <b>14</b>A. In changing its orientation from horizontal to upwardly angled (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>), the contact sensors <b>50</b>A, B disengage from the end plate <b>14</b>A and the transition lever arm <b>46</b> retracts within the housing of tractor module <b>22</b>. The mid-point in the transition of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> from the horizontal surface <b>12</b> to the vertical surface <b>14</b>A is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>, with the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> forming a right angle between the power module <b>24</b> and the cleaning and inspection module <b>26</b>. To accommodate the transition between the horizontal surface <b>12</b> and the vertical surface <b>14</b>A, the drive wheeled axle assemblies <b>32</b> and <b>42</b> are mounted on the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> so that a respective forward and rearward portion of the peripheral surface of each wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> extends radially outward from the end of the respective modules <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The rear push rod <b>137</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is positioned perpendicular to the horizontal surface <b>12</b>. When the solenoid (not shown separately) of the push rod <b>137</b> is energized, the rear push rod <b>137</b> extends to move the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> away from the horizontal surface <b>12</b> facilitating the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> to climb the end plate <b>14</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0117">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref>, depicting the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> after the transition is completed from the horizontal surface <b>12</b> to the end plate <b>14</b>A. In select embodiments of the present invention, the path for inspection of the end plates <b>14</b>A, B is preferred to follow a series of diametral lines, each being angularly displaced from the previous one. Employing this pattern, the entire surface of each of the end plates <b>14</b>A, B is inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0118">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-D</figref>. Obstacles encountered within a storage tank include raised seams, wave suppression plates, and internal ribs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref> A-D depict the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> navigating an obstacle. In select embodiments of the present invention, identification of an obstacle is based on a computer comparison of the known dimensions of an UST <b>10</b> with the distance the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> has traveled in a straight line since last contacting a perpendicular surface, such as a wall. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the contact sensor <b>50</b> B contacts the rib <b>54</b>. As described above for transitioning to another plane of operation, the transition lever <b>46</b> is pivoted downwardly and lifts the front of the tractor module <b>22</b> up, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. As the tractor <b>22</b> proceeds forward, the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>32</b> rolls up onto the rib <b>54</b> and the transition lever arm <b>46</b> retracts, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, when the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> pushes the robotic vehicle <b>20</b>, the front magnetized wheeled axel assembly <b>32</b> is rolled completely over the rib <b>54</b> and is able to roll on the horizontal surface <b>12</b> again. The rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly <b>42</b> continues to drive and to push the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> until it hits the rib <b>54</b> at which time the front drive wheeled axle assembly is able to assist in pulling the rear drive wheeled axle assembly over the rib <b>54</b>. Normal driving resumes when both magnetized wheeled axle assemblies <b>32</b>, <b>42</b> are again in contact with the horizontal surface <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, even though the inspection and cleaning module <b>26</b> is still being pulled over the rib <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0119">Upon initial insertion of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> through the riser <b>16</b> into an UST <b>10</b>, neither the position nor orientation of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is known to the computer <b>100</b>. Thus, in select embodiments of the present invention, the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is directed to maneuver through a series of preliminary runs for the purpose of initial orientation and position determination. The robotic vehicle <b>20</b> travels first in an arbitrary straight line. Signals generated by its three mutually orthogonal on-board inclinometers are monitored by the computer <b>100</b> to determine the shape and slope of the path being traversed. The robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is next directed to operate along a horizontal line. At one point, a contact sensor <b>50</b>A, B on the tractor module <b>22</b> contacts a surface approximately perpendicular to the surface on which the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is operating. The computer <b>100</b> combines the contact data with stored data on the direction of travel of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to establish position. Basic position and orientation information is now available for the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to begin inspecting the interior of the UST <b>10</b> to evaluate its surface condition and transmit data for the computer <b>100</b> to create a record of defects. In select embodiments of the present invention, a preferred path is for the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to travel forward along a first straight line on the cylindrical surface of the wall <b>12</b> until it contacts an end plate <b>14</b>A, B, then reverse direction to travel backward to the opposite end plate <b>14</b>A, B along a line that is substantially parallel to and slightly offset from the previous path. When the entire process of tank inspection has been completed, the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is lifted from the UST <b>10</b> by the tether <b>28</b> to a position near the riser <b>16</b> through which it entered. In select embodiments of the present invention, the tether <b>28</b> is connected to the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> causing the back of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> to tip up. The back of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is fitted with a retrieval bar (not shown separately) adapted for engaging by a retrieval hook (not shown separately) for removing the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> from the UST <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0120">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicting a flat projected map of the interior surface of the UST <b>10</b>. The map includes the unfurled surface of the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> and the end plates <b>14</b>A, B, each divided by reference grid lines. In select embodiments of the present invention, the surface of the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> is marked by square grid lines and the surface of the end plates <b>14</b>A, B by radial grid lines. The generation of these grids and plotting of the position of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> thereon are accomplished through a mapping program loaded on the computer <b>100</b>. For illustration, points locating defects of an UST <b>10</b> are marked with an “X” on the map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, whereas the present location of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> is marked by a small circle.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0121">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a flow chart on the operation of the mapping function of select embodiments of the present invention. The location of the robotic vehicle <b>20</b> within a UST <b>10</b> is determined by combining a start position <b>160</b> with data obtained from the on-board inclinometers <b>162</b> and the encoder-odometer <b>164</b>. These data provide a new position <b>166</b> that is marked <b>168</b> with a temporary designation, such as the “X” shown on the map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Measurements of the wall thickness are generated constantly by the ultrasonic transducers in the block <b>60</b>. The ultrasonic transducer wall measurement <b>172</b> is taken to derive a measured thickness <b>174</b> as an input to a determination <b>178</b> that compares the measurement <b>174</b> with a minimum thickness <b>176</b>. If the measured thickness is below the minimum, the temporary position “X” is made permanent as a defect <b>170</b> for establishing in a record <b>180</b> of defect locations. Whether the measured thickness is below or within tolerance, it is added to the accumulating total (record) <b>180</b> of measurements taken. This enable a determination of percentage defects <b>182</b>. A final test is a comparison <b>186</b> of the calculated percent defects with an established maximum percentage allowed <b>184</b>, the results of which if positive invokes a request for repair <b>188</b>, and if negative, a pass <b>190</b> with no required remediation.</p>
