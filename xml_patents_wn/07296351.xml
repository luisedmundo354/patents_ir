<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/847,674, filed May 18, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,089,987 which claims priority of Italian Patent Application No. VR2003A000062, filed May 19, 2003. The entire contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for automatically servicing a tired-wheel for motor-vehicles, i.e., for replacing the tire or the wheel-rim.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of motor-vehicle tired-wheel maintenance or servicing, an operator (tire-dealer) equipped with a conventional tire assembling-disassembling, or tire assembling-disassembling machine, is required to assess by sight, or to measure the diameter and/or thickness of a wheel-rim, to select a suitable type of tire for a given wheel-rim or, conversely, a suitable wheel-rim for a given tire, to locate the position of the inflation valve and to carry out several other tasks. Moreover, the operator must manually carry out a number of operations, some of which are hard and for which care must be taken to adopt a whole series of measures geared at preventing the tire or the wheel-rim, particularly if made of a light alloy, from being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inevitably, owing to the complexity of the operations to be carried out, and of the wealth of knowledge to exploit, at times mistakes are made that cause damage to tires and additional costs to be sustained.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to make the task of the tire-dealer easier, some solutions, albeit unsatisfactory, have already been suggested which are aimed at expediting single operations, such as providing an automatic tired-wheel loading device on the rotatable plate, or table or, anyway, on the self-centering unit of a tire assembling-disassembling machine, or else ejection-proof systems to prevent accidents caused by a tire being burst from occurring as a tire is inflated once it has just been replaced, or else a chip built-into the tire for displaying the peculiar features of a tire on a suitable displaying device embedded in the tire in order to provide the tire-dealer with reliable information.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, these are isolated solutions that minimally, if not in some instances negligibly, obviate the difficulties faced with by a tire-dealer in his daily job.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, it will be noted that an apparatus <b>1</b> for servicing a tired-wheel for motor vehicles comprises a tire assembling-disassembling machine <b>2</b> provided with a motor-driven rotatable support table <b>3</b> for supporting the wheel to be handled, control or sensor means designed to control both the position of the rotatable table <b>3</b>, such as an encoder <b>4</b>, and the load on it, e.g., a clutch <b>5</b>, a downward urging means <b>6</b> acting as a locking means on an intermediate portion of the wheel-rim to make the wheel rigid in rotation with the rotatable support table <b>3</b>, detecting means <b>7</b> designed to measure the size of the wheel-rim of a wheel lying on the support table <b>3</b>, and preferably also capable of reading a chip, possibly built in the tire or carried by the wheel-rim, as well as an electronic control processing unit EC.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">More particularly, the tire assembling-disassembling machine <b>2</b> has a support frame F, which supports a support plate <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Underneath the support plate a reduction gear <b>9</b> of any suitable type e.g., a worm screw-reduction gear unit is provided, suitable for being driven by a reversible electric motor <b>10</b> through a toothed belt transmission <b>10</b><i>a</i>. An output shaft <b>11</b> of reduction gear <b>9</b> extends vertically to engage with a sleeve through an inner pin <b>13</b> having a threaded end <b>14</b>. Sleeve <b>12</b> acts as a mandrel with multiple outer diameters which is mounted for rotation on lower bearing <b>15</b> and upper bearing <b>16</b> and imparts motion to a friction clutch, e.g., electromagnetically coupled friction clutch <b>5</b>, which transmits the motion to a fifth wheel <b>18</b>, mounted for rotation about sleeve <b>12</b> at bearing <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Above the fifth wheel <b>18</b>, and in meshing engagement with it, four pinion gears <b>19</b> equal to each other and substantially horizontal are arranged to be angularly spaced apart through 90¬∞ from each other, each of them being designed to engage with one end of a respective threaded shaft <b>20</b>, and to cause it to rotate therewith. Shafts <b>20</b> are also equal to each other and, at the other end of their respective threaded shaft, they engage with a respective worm-screw unit <b>21</b> supporting a respective jaw <b>22</b> rising upwards from the support table <b>3</b> through a respective radial slot formed in the table itself. Each jaw <b>22</b> has, in turn, at its top a flat surface <b>22</b><i>b </i>coated with a synthetic material <b>24</b> of any suitable type with a high friction coefficient, e.g., made of rubber, designed to contact an outer (lower) edge of a wheel-rim. The flat surfaces <b>22</b><i>b </i>lie in the same plane normal to the axis of rotation of the output shaft <b>11</b>, i.e., of rotatable table <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With the above described structure, in case a tired-wheel or a wheel-rim of a tired-wheel is placed on jaws <b>22</b>, once motor <b>10</b> is energized, it will cause sleeve <b>14</b>, and thus fifth wheel <b>18</b>, to rotate through friction clutch <b>5</b>. Fifth wheel <b>18</b> will actuate threaded shafts <b>20</b> causing them to pull jaws <b>22</b> towards the axis of sleeve <b>14</b> to bring a peripheral, preferably curved, thrust collar <b>22</b><i>b</i>, provided at the top of each jaw <b>22</b>, to abut against the outer (lower) abutment edge of the wheel-rim until this is precisely centered on the rotatable table <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the wheel-rim has been centered, urging device <b>6</b> is caused to move downwards, forcedly to lock the wheel-rim to the high friction coefficient material <b>24</b>. Only after the wheel-rim has been fully locked in position against jaws <b>22</b> will the rotary motion of the whole assembly formed by jaws <b>22</b> and support table <b>3</b> begin. By way of example, platform <b>3</b> will rotate, in use, at a variable speed ranging from 8 to 30 revolutions per minute (rpm) with a torque proportional to the load applied to it, e.g., a maximum load of 1000-1100 Nm, required for the specific type of wheel to be serviced.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Encoder <b>4</b> makes it possible constantly to control the angular position of table or platform <b>3</b> in order to determine the angular position of the inflation valve or that of the hole receiving the inflation valve, and possibly for a wheel pressure sensor, as it will be further explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The urging assembly <b>6</b> comprises an urging buffer or plate <b>25</b>, preferably provided at its lower face with a coating of a high friction coefficient material, such as rubber. The urging buffer or plate is mounted for rotation on a vertical stem <b>26</b> and controlled by it. Stem <b>26</b> extends from one end of a fluid, preferably air, operated cylinder-piston unit <b>27</b>, whose other end is hanging from a support arm <b>28</b>. Support arm <b>28</b> is suitable for being displaced between a working position above support table <b>3</b> and a rest position so as to keep the space above support table <b>3</b> clear, as will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">From a structural point of view, arm <b>28</b> can e.g., overhangingly extend from a fork-like upper-end <b>29</b> of a support upright frame <b>30</b>, rising from support frame F, preferably at the rear side of the tire assembling-disassembling machine <b>2</b>, so that, at its end proximal to support table <b>3</b>, it supports fluid operated cylinder <b>27</b>, whereas at its distal end it is pivoted about a horizontal pin <b>31</b>. The fluid operated cylinder <b>27</b> is safely held in its working position in which it must operate by a second horizontal pin <b>32</b>, designed to engage with a hole (not shown) formed in a end formation of arm <b>28</b> close to pin <b>31</b> upon control by an air-operated jack or a pair of juxtaposed air-operated jacks <b>33</b> which, upon control, extract it to allow arm <b>28</b> to be overturned upwards in order to be moved to its rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably, arm <b>28</b> is overturned by a fluid operated jack.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A wheel or wheel-rim lying on the support table <b>3</b> is caused to rotate by the friction building up between jaws <b>22</b> (material <b>24</b>) and an edge of the wheel-rim, as well as by the thrust exerted by pressing unit <b>6</b> onto the wheel-rim.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3A</figref> diagrammatically show an urging unit <b>6</b> that acts on the intermediate portion of the flange of a wheel-rim C provided with a tire T and an inflation valve <b>34</b>, and lying on a rotatable support table <b>3</b> provided with jaws <b>22</b>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a variation in which, instead of the rotatable support table <b>3</b>, a support plate <b>35</b> is provided, which is carried by sleeve <b>12</b> at the top thereof, and provided at its head with a centering cone <b>36</b> for engaging with the central bore of the flange of wheel-rim C.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, instead of the rotatable support table <b>3</b>, a frusto-conically shaped support <b>37</b> is provided, that is driven by sleeve <b>12</b> owing the engagement with the inner side of the lower edge of wheel-rim C in order to center and cause it to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">On support frame F detecting means <b>7</b> of any suitable type, e.g., including an infrared sensor or a camera, or a laser sensor, is suitably arranged, which preferably comprises a chip reader of any suitable type, as it is well known to a skilled person in the field of electronics, such a detecting means being designed to measure the diameter and thickness of a wheel-rim loaded on the tire assembling-disassembling machine <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a laser infrared sensor or a camera <b>7</b> is located well above the rotatable support table <b>3</b>, so as to sight a portion of the outer profile of wheel-rim C located on table <b>3</b> to measure the diameter and thickness of the wheel-rim C, and the position of the inflation valve <b>34</b>, the height of the lying plane of surfaces <b>22</b><i>a </i>of jaws <b>22</b> acting as a reference zero height mark.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a pair of detectors is provided, i.e., an upper detector <b>7</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and a lower detector <b>7</b><i>b </i>acting as a zero reference for any measurements made by the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Any detected measurement data are forwarded to the electronic control processing unit EC to be processed as required, as it will be further explained in below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Advantageously, in the above described tired-wheel maintenance apparatus the tire assembling-disassembling machine <b>2</b> is provided with a pair of extendable and collapsible working arms: an upper arm <b>40</b> and a lower arm <b>41</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 12</figref>), known per se in a tire assembling-disassembling machine, but includes control means for controlling the position and the load on the arms that make them suitable for carrying out additional operations besides the typical operations of releasing bead and disassembling tire T from a wheel-rim C.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">More particularly, working arms <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> are arranged substantially horizontal and slidably mounted along a pair or parallel guide uprights <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), each controlled by a respective screw <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> nut (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in screwing engagement with a threaded shaft <b>46</b> extending parallel to the guide uprights <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, and driven in turn by a reversible motor unit <b>47</b> preferably of a brushless type normally provided with a gear reduction unit, a load-controlling friction clutch, and an encoder for controlling the angular position thereof (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Each operating arm <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> comprises a support slide or carriage <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) fixed to a respective screw nut <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> and slidably mounted along its respective guide upright <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, a first hollow straight section <b>51</b> carried by a respective support slide or carriage <b>50</b>, a cursor or slider element <b>52</b> comprising a slide or carriage, longitudinally slidably mounted with respect to the first hollow section <b>51</b> and protruding therefrom, a second straight section <b>53</b> supported by respective slide or carriage <b>52</b> and a control reversible motor <b>54</b> for slide or carriage <b>52</b>, so that the second straight section <b>53</b> is extendable and retractable with respect to the first section <b>51</b>. As an example, motor <b>54</b> can drive a threaded shaft <b>55</b> that through a screw nut controls the slide or carriage <b>52</b> in a manner very similar to that illustrated with reference to threaded shaft <b>46</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Straight section <b>53</b> is provided at the head thereof with an idle frusto-conical roller <b>56</b> as well as with a retractable bead removing tool <b>57</b> driven by a respective air operated jack <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), e.g., as disclosed by Italian patent IT-1 328 351 published on May 21, 2003.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A positioning sensor <b>17</b> is provided, e.g., overhangingly supported close to the frusto-conical roller <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>), which preferably comprises a chip reader as well as a mounting pushing element <b>60</b> suitable for being driven by a fluid-operated cylinder <b>61</b> overhangingly supported by a jaw <b>62</b> carried by section <b>53</b>. Moreover, an inflation cap C is also preferably acting as a greasing nozzle G, a gripping element P arranged to tear off and remove an inflation valve made of rubber already fitted into the wheel-rim, and an arm V for automatically fitting or mounting an inflation valve into its respective seat formed in the wheel-rim (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a frusto-conical roller <b>56</b> with a tire T in its bead releasing position, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show the bead-releasing tool <b>57</b> in its fully extended position and in engagement with the inner edge of a tire T disassembled from a wheel-rim C by means of bead removing tool.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the servicing apparatus <b>1</b> is preferably provided with an automatic loading-unloading device <b>65</b>, which includes a substantially flat support frame, e.g., made of tubular members, consisting of two juxtaposed halves <b>66</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>b</i>, e.g., telescopically connected to each other, so that the support frame is extendible and retractable. At one or more sides of the support frame one or more respective linear actuators, e.g., reversible motor-reduction assemblies <b>67</b> are provided designed to drive a double start screw threaded shaft <b>68</b>, onto which two screw nuts <b>69</b><i>a </i>and <b>69</b><i>b </i>connected to a respective half <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>of the frame are screwable. Thus, when threaded shaft <b>68</b> is set in rotation in one direction, the two halves <b>66</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>b </i>of the support frame are moved apart from each other, and are brought together when the shaft <b>68</b> is caused to rotate in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Preferably, the two halves <b>66</b><i>a </i>and <b>66</b><i>b </i>of the frame are provided with rubberized pins or rollers <b>70</b> to restrain and clamp a tire or a tired-wheel loaded on the support frame, so that the tire or wheel can then be forced and centered within the perimeter of the support frame.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows a rubberized roller having support pin <b>70</b><i>a </i>on an end section of which a jacket <b>70</b><i>b </i>made of rubber or another material with a high friction coefficient is slidably mounted. More particularly, jacket <b>70</b><i>b </i>has two inner diameters: a smaller diameter substantially the same as that of pin <b>70</b><i>a </i>at which an annular slot <b>70</b><i>c </i>is formed for receiving a sealing gasket, and a larger diameter at the top of pin <b>70</b><i>a </i>which delimits a receiving gap <b>70</b><i>d </i>for a return spring <b>70</b><i>e </i>held in position by a seger ring <b>70</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Jacket <b>70</b><i>b </i>is closed at its head by a lid element <b>70</b><i>g </i>having an inner relief ring <b>70</b><i>h </i>suitable for abutting against the seger ring <b>70</b><i>f </i>and delimiting a chamber <b>70</b><i>i </i>that is in fluid communication with a compressed air source through an axial duct <b>70</b><i>k </i>within pin <b>70</b><i>a </i>and a side outlet <b>70</b><i>m </i>provided in a section of pin <b>70</b><i>a </i>not covered by the jacket. Thus, when compressed air is fed to duct <b>70</b><i>k</i>, pressure builds up within chamber <b>70</b><i>i </i>and causes jacket <b>70</b><i>b </i>to be axially displaced so that it extends out of pin <b>70</b><i>a</i>, whereas when the same duct is placed in fluid communication with the environmental air, the return spring <b>70</b><i>e </i>will cause jacket <b>70</b><i>b </i>to return to its retreated position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The support frame is fixed at the middle line thereof to one end of two support brackets or levers <b>71</b> and <b>72</b>, whose other end is pivoted to a pair of pins <b>73</b> aligned along the same horizontal axis and carried by a respective upright <b>74</b> rising from a respective slide or carriage <b>75</b> slidably mounted onto a horizontal section bar <b>76</b>, extending normal to the axis of pins <b>73</b> and preferably made rigid with frame F of the tire assembling-disassembling machine <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At least one support brackets or levers <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> is articulated to one end of a fluid, e.g., air, operated jack <b>77</b>, whose other end is articulated to a slide or carriage <b>75</b> so that support frame <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>can be angularly displaced by jack <b>77</b> between a lowered idle position with a slightly tilted attitude with respect to a vertical line, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and a working position lifted above the height of the rotatable support table <b>3</b> by the action exerted by the jack. Moreover, slide or carriage <b>75</b> is controlled by a fluid operated jack <b>78</b> designed to cause it to move together with the support frame <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>along guide section bar <b>76</b>, so as to move the frame from a side position with respect to the tire assembling-disassembling machine <b>2</b> to a centered position above the rotatable support plate <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a variation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> in which a pair of racks <b>69</b><i>c </i>and <b>69</b><i>d </i>driven by a motor reduction unit <b>67</b> and in meshing engagement with a toothed wheel <b>68</b><i>a </i>is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With the above described structure, once laid against the support frame <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>in its idle or waiting position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>), a wheel-rim or a tired-wheel to be serviced is first clamped between pins <b>70</b> of the frame by means of motor reduction unit <b>67</b>. Pins <b>70</b> are fed with compressed air to remove or slightly lift the wheel from its support plane formed by the frame, and subsequently, or synchronously, the wheel is lifted and centered above the rotatable support plate <b>3</b>. At this stage, compressed air feed to pins <b>70</b> is discontinued, and thus the wheel is slightly lowered, centered and laid on jaws <b>22</b> within ridges <b>22</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Jaws <b>22</b> are then caused to move towards the centre of the rotatable plate <b>3</b> and then to clamp the wheel-rim therebetween at the ridges <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Once the servicing has been completed, support frame <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>proceeds with automatically unloading the wheel and lying it onto the ground. To this end, compressed air is fed to pins <b>70</b>, whereby lifting the wheel to a height greater than that of the ridges <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and then jacks <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> are energized to allow the frame to be returned to its starting position.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows on an enlarged scale a fitting belonging to the servicing apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> while carrying out an operation of fitting a tire T onto a wheel-rim C located on rotatable support plate <b>3</b>. The fitting tool is hanging from an overhanging support, such as an arm <b>80</b>, e.g., overhangingly extending from the top of guide uprights <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>, or supported in any other suitable way, and formed with an urging sliding block <b>81</b>, articulated to the lower end of a fluid operated jack <b>83</b>, whose upper end is articulated about a pin <b>85</b>, carried by arm <b>80</b> in any suitable way, so that, in use, jack <b>83</b> can bring sliding block <b>81</b> to lie onto a tire to be fitted and press the tire through a given angular displacement thereof when the tire is caused to rotate to force it to be fitted into wheel-rim C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the pair of uprights <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> is mounted for rotation about a common vertical axis, so that they are controlled to be angularly displaced about it, e.g., by being controlled by a reversible motor of any suitable type. Working arms <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> act as gripping elements for a tire T or a tired wheel to be serviced and, once centered, are arranged to load the wheel onto the rotatable support plate <b>3</b> and unload it from plate <b>3</b> when the maintenance is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 17</figref> show the operating sequence of the several working steps provided by the control software stored in the electronic processing unit EC.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">First of all, maintenance apparatus <b>1</b> is checked for proper operation, then the system is reset, and synchronization with the tire loading-unloading means (loading frame <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b</i>‚Äî<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or else working arms <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) is effected. By means of a suitable chip reader located close to the sensing means <b>7</b>, or arranged elsewhere, the chip possibly fitted into tire T and storing the system's working parameters is read.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At this stage, jaws <b>22</b>, provided in rotatable support table <b>3</b>, are opened or spread apart from each other and the tired-wheel or wheel-rim is loaded onto jaws <b>22</b>. The wheel or the wheel-rim is centered onto jaws <b>22</b>, and locked in position thereon by means of ridges <b>22</b><i>b</i>, as explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Laser sensors <b>7</b> or <b>7</b><i>a </i>then measure the thickness and diameter of wheel-rim C by optical triangulation, and locate the position of the inflation valve or the hole or seat provided for receiving an inflation valve. Possibly, the wheel is angularly displaced to avoid to damage a sensor fitted close to the inflation valve in the wheel-rim.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">At this stage, a tire disassembling cycle can be started, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The upper working arm <b>40</b> is first positioned so that its roller <b>56</b> is brought close to the outer edge of the wheel-rim. Likewise, lower working arm <b>41</b> is positioned so that its roller <b>56</b> is brought close to the lower edge of the wheel-rim.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Urging or pressure plate <b>25</b> is lowered against the flange of wheel-rim C, then air is cut off from pins <b>70</b>, so as to urge the wheel onto jaws <b>22</b> that clamp the wheel-rim after the rotatable plate <b>3</b>, and thus the wheel arranged thereon, has been set in rotation. Working arms <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> exert a pressure against the beads of the tire close to the edges of the wheel-rim in order to release the tire-bead.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Bead-removing tools <b>57</b> then extend from both arms <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> to disassemble tire T from wheel-rim C. Tools <b>56</b> are then controlled synchronously to rise, after having previously moved slightly backwards beyond the wheel-rim diameter to cause tire T to be disassembled from the wheel-rim. Bead-removing tool <b>57</b> is retreated and one possibly proceeds with the extraction of the inflation valve by means of extraction element P.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Information relating to detection and disassembling steps which have already been carried out is possibly entered into the chip fitted in the tire, and the tire is removed. Should the wheel rim be found to be damaged, it is released and replaced with a new one. Moreover, a report about the carried out operations is printed and apparatus <b>1</b> is set in a standby or idle mode ready to start a new maintenance cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">On the other hand, if only the tire is to be replaced, urging device <b>6</b> is lifted or, in any case, moved away, the worn-out tire is removed, and a new tire is loaded on the wheel-rim located on support table <b>3</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the old tire can be removed and a new tire loaded by means of working arms <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Urging or pressure device <b>6</b> is once again caused to act upon the wheel-rim to hold it abutting against jaws <b>22</b>, a new inflation valve is then fitted by means of arm V, and an air operated mounting cycle initiated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">At the beginning, lower working arm <b>41</b> is positioned so that its roller <b>56</b> is arranged close to the lower edge of the wheel-rim, and bead-removing tool <b>57</b> is caused to extend out of arm <b>41</b>. Then, when provided, the fitting tool shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is positioned in its open configuration on tire T lying on the wheel-rim. The mounting urging or pressure device <b>60</b> is preferably caused to be lowered onto the tire, and energized, while rotatable table <b>3</b> is set in rotation, and thus owing to the action exerted by the mounting urging device the wheel-rim and the tire are also caused to rotate, the tire being urged against the wheel-rim by sliding-block <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Finally, once the mounting has been accomplished, inflation cap V, and thus greasing device G, are actuated, the bead releasing tool <b>57</b> is caused to be collapsed, and tool <b>56</b> (arm <b>41</b>) is positioned in its resting position.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Then, one proceeds with moving away urging device <b>6</b>, and causing the tired-wheel to be removed either by means of frame <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b</i>, which has previously lifted rollers <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or by means of working arms <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A report listing the operations carried out is printed in the end, and the maintenance apparatus is set in an idle mode.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> diagrammatically shows a self-learning system for the maintenance apparatus, while keeping up-dated a suitable data-base containing directions required to carry out a correct sequence of disassembling or assembling operations for a specific tire provided with a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A plurality of maintenance apparatuses are connected in a network both to a, preferably world-wide, central data-base, or server, and to a local data-base. The information stored in data-bases can be downloaded by any enabled maintenance apparatus <b>1</b>, e.g., subject to authorization. At the same time, each maintenance apparatus <b>1</b> assists in updating its local data-base.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It is also contemplated that each maintenance apparatus <b>1</b> is suitable for carrying out an uploading step of the central data-base or the server. In particular, it is possible to store the assembling and/or disassembling sequence of a tire onto and from its respective wheel-rim that is not contained in the latest release available at the central data-base.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The stored sequence of operations is then sent to the central data base and, possibly, once it has been assessed and checked by an appointed entity, entered into the central data-base, thereby generating a new release of the data-base.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In order to carry out the data-base downloading and uploading steps, any available communication network can be used, such as internet, telephone network, or a satellite-based network.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The above network can also be applied at the level of one tire-maintenance centre, where a plurality of maintenance apparatuses <b>1</b> can be interconnected or connected to a preexisting network. In such a case an Ethernet-type network or a wireless network can be used as a communication network, through which each maintenance apparatus <b>1</b> gains access to a local central server in charge of keeping its data-base up-dated with the latest available release thereof.</p>
