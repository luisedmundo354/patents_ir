<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In some situations, vibration of a housing or other mounting structure can cause one or more of the devices within that housing or otherwise attached to such a mounting structure to malfunction. For example, one piece of equipment may function perfectly well in one environment, but when that same piece of equipment is placed in proximity to other equipment, the vibrations from that other equipment may, when combined with vibration generated internal to the equipment in question, cause the equipment in question to malfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In some situations, the operation of the equipment itself may, under some circumstances, be enough to cause malfunctioning of the equipment. This is particularly true as the data transfer rates of equipment continues to increase. This increase in data transfer rates translates, in some situations, to increased vibrations, which, in turn, may cause malfunctions to occur.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown one embodiment of the teachings of the inventive concept showing system <b>10</b> in which drive cage <b>13</b> has mounted within it a plurality of data transfer devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N, such as may comprise disk drives comprising a RAID array. RAID circuit <b>15</b> (shown in schematic form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may also be included within system <b>10</b>. Also associated with drive cage <b>13</b> is accelerometer <b>11</b> connected to cage <b>13</b>. Accelerometer could, for example be a tri-axial accelerometer, and could be on the outside of drive cage <b>13</b>, or mounted within drive cage <b>13</b>, the purpose being to create a signal (for example, an amplitude and frequency signal) showing the vibration amplitude of drive cage <b>13</b> for various vibration frequencies. Typically, the frequency of vibration would be between 0 and 700 Hz. The precise frequency and frequency range would depend upon the product or devices being protected. Accelerometer <b>11</b> of one embodiment is designed to provide a broadband spectrum response over a range of frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In operation according to one embodiment, accelerometer <b>11</b> continuously monitors the frequency and amplitude of the vibration produced by drive cage <b>13</b> (or, if desired, by a particular device with cage <b>13</b>) and provides that input for monitoring and comparison against a known standard for the particular device(s) of concern. Monitor signal of accelerometer <b>11</b> would typically describe a curve within a set of boundaries. When the frequency and/or amplitude of vibrations monitored by accelerometer <b>11</b> exceeds a given curve (for example, exceeds 2 gs at 4,000 Hz) a control signal may be generated, whether internally by accelerometer <b>11</b> or by a system coupled thereto. In one embodiment, this control signal is communicated via cable <b>12</b> to RAID circuit <b>15</b>. Circuit <b>15</b>, in turn, operates to reduce (or turn off) the data transfer rate of one or more of devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N. According to one embodiment, this operation reduces the vibrations associated with operation of the devices in the cage and also protects the data transfer from jiggling and therefore data loss.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the example discussed, slowing down the data transfer rate of a data transfer device reduces the vibration it causes. Also, by slowing down the data transfer rate of all of the data transfer devices in cage <b>13</b>, these devices are less prone to error caused by vibration. Such vibration could be because of a building vibration or could be because equipment in close proximity to drive cage <b>13</b> is setting up a vibration in drive cage <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It should be appreciated that, in operation, system <b>10</b> could reduce one data transfer unit, or all the data transfer units. Moreover, such reduction need not be equally applied within cage <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Device <b>16</b> is used, if desired, to induce known vibration to cage <b>13</b> for calibration purposes. For example, device <b>16</b> may be utilized to empirically determine vibration frequencies and/or amplitudes at which degraded performance of data transfer devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N is experienced for setting control threshold values according to embodiments of the invention. Additionally or alternatively, device <b>16</b> may be utilized in determining data transfer rate adjustments suitable for addressing particular vibration frequencies and/or amplitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block schematic diagram of one embodiment of the operation of the teachings of the inventive concept. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, accelerometer <b>11</b> within system <b>20</b> provides a signal, which in the embodiment discussed is an amplitude (and/or frequency) curve. This signal is provided via cable <b>12</b> to circuit <b>15</b>, which has associated therewith CPU <b>21</b> and data base <b>22</b>. Circuit <b>15</b> could be a RAID circuit if desired and could be located within cage <b>13</b> or remote therefrom. Cable <b>12</b> could be replaced with a wireless transmitter if desired. Circuit <b>15</b> matches the currently provided signal from accelerometer <b>11</b> against one or more signal curves, as stored in data base <b>22</b>, to determine if the vibration level of drive cage <b>13</b> exceeds a desired amount. If it does not, then data transfer devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N are allowed to operate at their normal speed or at their present settings. If, however, the current vibration exceeds the desired vibration level then the circuit operates to reduce the data transfer rate of at least one of data transfer devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N. As discussed, this reduction could be by turning one or more devices off, by reducing the data transfer rate of one or more devices via signals sent over path <b>202</b>, or combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a flow chart of one embodiment of the generation of a desired vibration level for establishing standard reference signal levels for vibration which will then be utilized to compare against subsequent vibration signals to determined if action needs be taken. Process <b>301</b>, if desired, may be used to set the number of different signal levels desired. These levels could be established so that a user from time to time could select different acceptable vibration levels for a particular device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Process <b>302</b> determines whether any signal levels are user supplied. This again is optional. If the user supplies a known signal, process <b>303</b> controls how this signal is to be obtained from the user. If there are no user supplied levels, then the system optionally, under process <b>304</b>, induces known vibration (for example, via device <b>16</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) into drive cage <b>13</b>. In process <b>305</b> the signal is captured from accelerometer <b>11</b> via circuit, <b>15</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The captured signal is then stored in data base <b>22</b>, for example under control of CPU <b>21</b> as shown by process <b>306</b>. After this recording is complete the system then checks, via process <b>307</b>, to see if there are more levels to be established. If there are, then processes <b>304</b>, <b>305</b>, and <b>306</b> are repeated until all of the desired levels have been set. At that point the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a flow chart of one embodiment <b>40</b> of the teachings of the invention. Process <b>401</b> compares a recent accelerometer signal obtained from accelerometer <b>111</b> against a standard. This standard could be the only signal in data base <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) pertaining to the system being tested or could be a standard that is selected from among several, via process <b>402</b>. Some of the signals could be provided, if desired, live from the user and not stored previously if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Process <b>403</b> determines if the signal is too high, e.g., the amplitude at a certain frequency is outside of a given range. This can be accomplished by well-known signal level comparitor devices, such as one of the many integrated circuit comparitors available today, or as may be implemented in software.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In process <b>404</b>, if the vibration signal that is currently being received is out of range then a control signal is sent and this signal is received by process <b>405</b> and is used to adjust the data transfer rate of one or more of data transfer devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>14</b>-N (as discussed above). The system then compares the new vibration signal (after adjustment), via process <b>406</b>, and if the signal is still too high, via process <b>407</b>, then an additional speed reduction is initiated via process <b>404</b> and <b>405</b>. Again, if desired, the accelerometer signal is compared to see if the vibration signal is within the acceptable range. If it is, then the whole process repeats via process <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system can be set to monitor vibration even when no data is being transferred, or data transfer is off. Such an embodiment might be desired because, if extrinsic vibration is too high, other data transfer devices in other locations might be used to reduce errors. This, for example, could be controlled via process <b>408</b>, which signals that this device is available when the signal level (vibration) is not too high. Process <b>409</b> signals to select another device when vibration of this device is higher than desired.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that while the illustrative embodiment has focused on data transfer devices, such as disk drives or printers, other devices, e.g., any devices which are the source of vibration and/or is susceptible to the effects of vibration such as fans, scanners, and the like, may be subject to the same control. Also the device which suffers from excess vibration may not be the device which causes such vibration. Thus, it may be desirable to reduce a parameter of a device other than a data transfer device to achieve the desired results.</p>
