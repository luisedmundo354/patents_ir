<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/971,355, filed Oct. 22, 2004 and entitled “Adjustable Conveyor System,” which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/574,280 entitled “Stowable Material Transport Conveyor,” filed Jun. 9, 2005, the entire disclosures of both applications are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various systems are used for processing dirt and/or debris mixtures, which may include rocks, concrete pieces, stumps, stones, discarded hardware, and other types of dirt and/or debris. That processing may include feeding and screening the dirt and/or debris mixtures into multiple piles. For example, one pile may contain essentially soil, and other piles may contain material of different sizes with at least some of those piles having commercial value as a recycled product. An example of a system for processing dirt and/or debris mixtures is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,608, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many processing systems are mobile to enable a user to relocate those systems when the user needs to process the mixtures and form the piles in a different location. Sometimes the user needs to relocate the systems because the piles are at the desired levels and the user needs to form the piles in different locations, such as adjacent the previous piles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To minimize relocation of the processing systems, multiple conveyors may be provided in those systems to allow the user to form piles of processed material in different locations. Alternatively, adjustable conveyor systems may be provided to allow the user to form piles in different locations, or to form wider piles, and still allow easy relocation of the processing systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment provides a system for conveying material. The system includes: a hopper having a feed end and a discharge end, wherein the feed end is configured to receive material; and an elongate conveyor downstream from the discharge end, wherein the elongate conveyor is configured to pivot about at least three axes.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> depict an embodiment of an adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> having a conveying structure <b>22</b>, a support structure <b>24</b>, and a feed structure <b>26</b>. The adjustable conveyor system may be supported by a vehicle <b>110</b>. Vehicle <b>110</b> includes an elongate vehicle frame <b>112</b>. Supporting one end of the frame for movement over the ground, which is the rear end of the frame in the particular embodiment illustrated, are transport wheels <b>114</b>. The opposite end of the vehicle frame, which is the frame's forward end, mounts a hitch component <b>116</b>, which is connectable with suitable hitch structure at the rear of a drawing vehicle or tractor to ready the vehicle for movement as a trailer over a road or highway.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> is shown to be supported by a particular vehicle, the adjustable conveyor system may be supported by any suitable structure configured to enable the user to relocate or move the adjustable conveyor system to desired locations. For example, adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> may be mounted on any mobile screening system, which may or may not be on a vehicle, and which may be wheeled or tracked.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Conveying structure <b>22</b> includes any structure configured to transport material from a feed end <b>28</b> to a discharge end <b>30</b>. The conveying structure includes an elongate conveyor <b>32</b> including an elongate frame <b>34</b>, end rolls <b>35</b>, rollers <b>36</b>, and a conveyor belt <b>38</b>. Conveyor belt <b>38</b> moves in a direction from feed end <b>28</b> to discharge end <b>30</b> and may be made of any suitable material configured to flex and remain operatively connected to elongate conveyor <b>38</b> when all or portions of the elongate conveyor is pivoted around plural axes, as further discussed below. Any suitable drive system may be used configured to move conveyor belt <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The elongate conveyor includes a feed portion <b>40</b> and a conveying portion <b>42</b> pivotally connected to the feed portion, as further discussed below. Feed portion <b>40</b> is configured to received material from, for example, feed structure <b>26</b>. Conveying portion <b>42</b> is configured to move material from feed portion <b>40</b> to discharge end <b>30</b> and may be a substantial portion or a majority of length of elongate conveyor <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A pair of elongate skirt boards (not shown) may be mounted along elongate frame <b>34</b>. Those skirt boards have lower edges adjacent the upper belt run of conveyor belt <b>38</b>, and from the lower edges extend upwardly and then incline outwardly to terminate in upper edges. The skirt boards help to maintain material suitable located over the conveyor belt as the material is carried forwardly by the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Conveying portion <b>42</b> is pivotably connected to feed portion <b>40</b> via hinge connections <b>44</b> configured to allow conveying portion <b>42</b> to pivot around an incline axis A. An example of suitable hinge connections is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The hinge connections allow adjusting of the incline of conveying portion <b>42</b> from a horizontal position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to plural inclined positions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, the hinge connections allow pivoting of conveying portion <b>42</b> from a pivoted position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to a travel position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. To facilitate the pivoting of conveying portion <b>42</b>, a first pivoting connector assembly <b>46</b> may be connected to conveying portion <b>42</b>, which includes any structure configured to pivot the conveying portion around incline axis A. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, first pivoting connector assembly <b>46</b> includes a radial swinging or telescoping cylinder <b>48</b> connected to conveying portion <b>42</b> configured to pivot that portion in any suitable range. First pivoting connector assembly <b>46</b> may be connected to any suitable hydraulic system (not shown) or other drive system configured to selectively move telescoping cylinder <b>48</b> thereby pivoting conveying portion <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The conveying portion also is pivotably connected to feed portion <b>40</b> via rotary connection <b>50</b> configured to allow conveying portion <b>42</b> to pivot around a stowing axis B. An example of a suitable rotary connection is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The rotary connection allows the pivoting of conveying portion <b>42</b> from a working position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to a pivoted position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Any suitable locking mechanism, such as locking pins, latches, etc., may be used to lock conveying portion <b>42</b> in the working position and/or the pivoted position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A second pivoting connector assembly <b>52</b> may be connected to rotary connection <b>50</b> and includes any structure configured to pivot conveying portion <b>42</b> around stowing axis B. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, second pivoting connector assembly <b>52</b> includes a radial swinging or telescoping cylinder <b>54</b> connected to a lever <b>56</b>, which is connected to rotary connection <b>50</b>. The second pivoting connector assembly may be configured to pivot conveying portion <b>42</b> in any suitable range. Additionally, second pivoting connector assembly <b>52</b> may be connected to any suitable hydraulic system (not shown) or other drive system configured to selectively move telescoping cylinder <b>54</b> thereby pivoting conveying portion <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Support structure <b>24</b> includes any structure configured to support elongate conveyor <b>32</b>. The support structure includes support bar <b>58</b> pivotally mounted on vehicle frame <b>112</b>. Support bar <b>58</b> includes a first end portion <b>60</b> below vehicle frame <b>112</b> and a second end portion <b>62</b> above vehicle frame <b>112</b>. The first end portion supports elongate conveyor <b>32</b> between feed portion <b>40</b> and conveying portion <b>42</b> below vehicle frame <b>112</b>. Additionally, first end portion <b>60</b> allows elongate conveyor <b>32</b> to pivot among plural extended or working positions around a spreading axis C. Although the support structure is illustrated to support the elongate conveyor below the vehicle frame, the support structure may be configured to support that conveyor above or on the same plane as the vehicle frame. Moreover, although support bar <b>58</b> is shown to support elongate conveyor <b>32</b> between feed portion <b>40</b> and conveying portion <b>42</b>, that conveyor may be supported in any suitable location and by any suitable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Additionally, a third pivoting connector assembly <b>64</b> operatively connects second end portion <b>62</b> and conveying portion <b>42</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b>. The third pivoting connector assembly includes any structure configured to pivot conveying portion <b>42</b> around incline axis A. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, third pivoting connector assembly <b>64</b> may include a telescoping cylinder <b>66</b>, a central cable <b>68</b>, a cable cross beam <b>70</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), support cables <b>72</b>, and connectors <b>74</b> located on the sides of conveying portion <b>42</b> of the elongate conveyor. The third pivoting connector assembly may be configured to pivot conveying portion <b>42</b> in any suitable range thereby allowing for plural extended positions, three of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Additionally, third pivoting connector assembly <b>64</b> may be connected to any suitable hydraulic system (not shown) or other drive system configured to selectively move telescoping cylinder <b>66</b> thereby pivoting conveying portion <b>42</b> around incline axis A.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The adjustable conveyor system further includes a fourth pivoting connector assembly <b>76</b>, which includes any structure configured to pivot elongate conveyor <b>32</b> around spreading axis C. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, fourth pivoting connector assembly <b>76</b> may include a telescoping cylinder <b>78</b> connected to a lever <b>80</b>, which is connected to support bar <b>58</b>. The fourth pivoting connector assembly may be configured to pivot elongate conveyor <b>32</b> in any suitable range. Additionally, fourth pivoting connector assembly <b>76</b> may be connected to any suitable hydraulic system (not shown) or other drive system configured to selectively move telescoping cylinder <b>78</b> thereby pivoting elongate conveyor <b>32</b> around spreading axis C.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Fourth pivoting connector assembly <b>76</b> may be configured to pivot elongate conveyor in any suitable pivot range thereby allowing adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> to have plural extended or working positions, two of those positions are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Those plural working positions allow the discharge of material into wider piles. For example, the fourth pivoting connector assembly may allow for a 54-degree range, which may allow for approximately four times the pile volume compared to a non-pivoting conveyor assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although the pivotal connections illustrated include hinges and rotary connections, any suitable pivotal connection configured to allow adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> to pivot around plural axes may be used. Additionally, although the pivoting connector assemblies illustrated include radial swinging or telescoping cylinders and drive systems, any suitable pivoting connector structure configured to allow adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> to pivot around plural axes may be used. For example, rotary hydraulic cylinders, rotary pneumatic cylinders, servo motors, and rotary turntable systems may alternatively, or additionally, be used. Moreover, although the pivoting connector assemblies illustrated all have similar structures, any combination of similar or different structures may be used for the pivoting connector assemblies of the adjustable conveyor system. Furthermore, although four pivoting connector assemblies have been illustrated, the adjustable conveyor system may have more or less assemblies configured to allow that system to pivot around plural axes, including the axes disclosed above.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Feed structure <b>26</b> includes any structure configured to receive material and feed that material to conveying structure <b>22</b>. The feed structure includes a hopper <b>82</b> located below vehicle frame <b>112</b> with a feed end <b>84</b> and a discharge end <b>86</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>). The hopper may be any suitable hopper including a hopper with wing walls <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, which may be stationary or hinged.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hopper <b>82</b> may be completely open at the forward end of the hopper. This is referred to herein as a completely open forward throat for the hopper, which is advantageous, as it means that randomly encountered large objects, such as stumps, used plumbing hardware, rocks, etc., are free to move forwardly with the conveyor belt without meeting an over hanging obstruction that would impede such motion. Hopper <b>82</b> also is operatively connected to feed portion <b>40</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b> and thus pivots with elongate conveyor <b>32</b> around spreading axis C via fourth pivoting connector assembly <b>76</b>. Although hopper <b>82</b> is illustrated to be below vehicle frame <b>112</b>, the hopper may be configured to be above or in the same plane as the vehicle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hopper <b>82</b> also is supported by support structure <b>24</b>. Support structure <b>24</b> includes tracks <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>, which includes any structure configured to support hopper <b>82</b> and/or feed portion <b>40</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b> and allow pivoting around spreading axis C. Hopper <b>82</b> is slidingly connected to the tracks via cam or track followers <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. Although the support structure is illustrated to include tracks, any suitable structure configured to support hopper <b>82</b> and/or feed portion <b>40</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b> and allow pivoting around spreading axis C may be used. Additionally, although hopper <b>82</b> is shown to include the track followers, feed portion <b>40</b> may instead or in addition have track followers slidingly connected to tracks <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Feed structure <b>26</b> also may include a stationary hopper <b>100</b> located above vehicle frame <b>112</b>. Hopper <b>82</b> and stationary hopper <b>100</b> are configured to ensure that materials are properly fed onto feed portion <b>40</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b> regardless of the working position the elongated conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although feed structure <b>26</b> is illustrated to include swinging and stationary hoppers, one type of hopper may be used exclusively or any other combination may be used that is configured to ensure that materials are properly fed onto feed portion <b>40</b> of the elongate conveyor. Additionally, although feed structure <b>26</b> is shown to be located just above feed portion <b>40</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b>, additional structure may be located between feed structure <b>26</b> and feed portion <b>40</b> so long as the feed portion is downstream from the feed structure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In operation, conveying structure <b>22</b> and feed structure <b>26</b> is pivotable among plural extended or working positions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, via fourth pivoting connector assembly <b>76</b>. Adjustable conveyor system may thus be adjusted among the plural extended positions based on desired pile locations or pile widths.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the adjustable conveyor system needs to be moved or relocated, the system may be adjusted to an inoperative or travel position. First, the conveying and feed structures are pivoted to a starting position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> via third pivoting connector assembly <b>64</b> and/or fourth pivoting connector assembly <b>76</b>. Second, conveying portion <b>42</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b> is pivoted to an intermediate extended position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> via second pivoting connector assembly <b>52</b>. Third, conveying portion <b>42</b> is pivoted to an intermediate inoperative position running lengthwise along the vehicle frame illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> via first pivoting connector assembly <b>46</b>. Fourth, conveying portion <b>42</b> is pivoted to a travel or an inoperative position running lengthwise and/or inclining along the vehicle frame illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> via second pivoting connector assembly <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, a locking assembly <b>102</b> may be used to secure conveying portion <b>42</b> in the travel position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Locking assembly <b>102</b> may include trailering mount <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> or any other suitable structure configured to secure conveying portion <b>42</b> of the elongate conveyor to the travel position. Thus, the adjustable conveyor system is configured to pivot conveying portion <b>42</b> among an inoperative position, where the conveying portion runs lengthwise along vehicle frame <b>112</b> (where an end of the conveying portion may extend beyond an end of the vehicle frame), and plural working positions, where the conveying portion runs laterally of the vehicle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To adjust the adjustable conveyor system from the inoperative position to one of plural extended or working positions, the steps above may simply be reversed. However, the steps discussed above may be performed in different sequences and in different combinations, not all steps being required for all embodiments of the adjustable conveyor system.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> has been described to include feed structure <b>26</b>, such structure is not essential to the adjustable conveyor system. For example, adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> may be used to receive the discharge from a screening system or any other system and not require a feed structure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally, or alternatively, adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> may be driven by a two-speed or other variable-speed hydraulic motor (not shown). Adjusting the speed of the conveyor during operation may allow piling of material at two or more distances from discharge end <b>30</b>, which may allow an increase of pile volume as compared to a non-variable-speed conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref> show a mobile screening system or feeding and screening vehicle <b>210</b> that includes an embodiment of the adjustable conveyor system. The vehicle includes an elongate vehicle frame <b>212</b>. Supporting one end of the frame for movement over the ground, which is the rear end of the frame are transport wheels <b>214</b>. The opposite end of the vehicle frame, which is the frame's forward end, mounts a hitch component <b>216</b>, which is connectable with suitable hitch structure at the rear of a drawing vehicle or tractor to ready the vehicle for movement as a trailer over the road or highway. Although the mobile screening system is shown to be supported by a wheeled vehicle frame, any suitable vehicle frame may be used, including a tracked vehicle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The forward portion of the vehicle includes a hopper and an inclined, material-transport conveyor, which carries material fed from the hopper rearwardly to an elevated position on the vehicle. The material-transport conveyor is shown at <b>226</b>, and the hopper at <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The transport conveyor may extend a substantial portion of the length of the vehicle frame, and extends from adjacent the forward end of the vehicle frame to slightly beyond its midpoint progressing from the forward to the rear end of the frame. The hopper is disposed over a lower inclined portion of the inclined transport conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Mounted as a continuation of the material-transport conveyor, in a position extending from approximately the midpoint of the vehicle to the rear end of the vehicle, is a multiple deck screen assembly <b>290</b>. The assembly has two decks, namely upper deck <b>300</b> and lower deck <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each deck includes heavy-duty screening extending along the length of the deck. The screening on the top deck has a coarser mesh than the screening on the deck below it. The screening in both decks slope or incline downwardly progressing from the feed end of the screen assembly, which is directly adjacent the outfeed end of the material-transport conveyor, to the discharge end of the assembly, which is located at the rear of the vehicle approximately over wheels <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Material on traveling through the screen assembly is separated into three different fractions. The largest fraction, comprising stumps, large rocks, etc., travels down the upper deck without passing through the screen of the deck and then onto a material-channeling structure or chute <b>320</b>. The largest material leaving the upper deck of the screen assembly travels onto this chute then to be deflected into a region located rearwardly of the rear end of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Adjacent the rear end of the vehicle is an intermediate deck conveyor <b>330</b>. Material that passes through the upper deck screen and is retained on the lower deck, on cascading down the incline of the lower deck, is deposited on conveyor <b>330</b> to collect as a pile at an end of section <b>332</b> with the section in its inclined position. Intermediate deck conveyor <b>330</b> may include any suitable structure configured to provide adjustability between an extended position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and an inoperative position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18</figref>. For example, the intermediate deck conveyor may be pivotally connected at two or more locations along the length of the conveyor. Additionally, a pivoting connector assembly, such as the assemblies described above, may be used to pivot the intermediate deck conveyor between the extended position and the inoperative position.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although intermediate deck conveyor <b>330</b> is shown to have particular inoperative and extended positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>, the intermediate deck conveyor may be configured to have any suitable inoperative and/or extended positions. For example, at least some of the pivotal connections and pivoting connector assemblies described for adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> may be used to enable intermediate deck conveyor <b>330</b> to be adjusted between an extended position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and an inoperative position in which a substantial portion of that conveyor runs lengthwise along a side of vehicle frame <b>212</b> towards a central portion of the vehicle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Extending under the lower deck of the screen assembly, and in an inclined position, is what is referred to as an under-screen conveyor <b>360</b>. That conveyor extends throughout a portion of its length completely under the lower deck of the screen assembly, and functions to collect material that passes through the lower deck and to convey the material upwardly and toward the front of the vehicle frame.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Downstream the outfeed end of the under-screen conveyor is an embodiment of the adjustable conveyor system <b>420</b>. The adjustable conveyor system includes at least some of the structure discussed above and is configured to be adjustable among an inoperative position and plural extended positions. For example, adjustable conveyor system <b>420</b> includes a conveying structure <b>422</b>, a support structure <b>424</b>, and a feed structure <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additionally, the adjustable conveyor system is adjustable among plural extended positions, three of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and an inoperative position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18</figref>. Furthermore, a locking assembly <b>202</b> may be used to secure conveying structure <b>422</b> in the inoperative position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Locking assembly <b>202</b> may include trailering mount <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> or any other suitable structure configured to secure conveying structure <b>422</b> of the adjustable conveyor system to the inoperative position.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As discussed above, although the pivoting connector assemblies illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-18</figref> include radial swinging or telescoping cylinders and drive systems, any suitable pivoting connector structure configured to allow adjustable conveyor system <b>20</b> to pivot around plural axes may be used. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-20</figref> illustrate an alternative second pivoting connector assembly <b>152</b>. The second pivoting connector assembly <b>152</b> may be connected to rotary connection <b>50</b> and includes any structure configured to pivot conveying portion <b>42</b> of elongate conveyor <b>32</b> around stowing axis B. For example, second pivoting connector assembly <b>152</b> may include a rotary turntable or rotary actuator <b>154</b> connected to rotary connection <b>50</b>. An example of a suitable rotary actuator is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,422,366, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The rotary actuator may be configured to pivot conveying portion <b>42</b> in any suitable range. Additionally, rotary actuator <b>154</b> may be connected to any suitable hydraulic system (not shown) or other drive system configured to selectively move the rotary actuator thereby pivoting conveying portion <b>42</b>. Although rotary actuator <b>154</b> is shown to be included in second pivoting connector assembly <b>152</b>, the rotary actuator may be used for any combination of the pivoting connector assemblies discussed above. Additionally, the pivoting connector assemblies discussed may include any combination of telescoping cylinders, rotary actuators, and/or other suitable pivoting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Although the adjustable conveyor system and features of the adjustable conveyor system have been shown and described with reference to the foregoing operational principles and preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will find apparent that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the claims. The present disclosure is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variances that fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
