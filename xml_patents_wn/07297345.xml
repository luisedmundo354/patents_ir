<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to systems, methods and apparatuses for manufacturing dosage forms, and to dosage forms made using such systems, methods and apparatuses.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A variety of dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules and gelcaps are known in the pharmaceutical arts. Tablets generally refer to relatively compressed powders in various shapes. One type of elongated, capsule-shaped tablet is commonly referred to as a “caplet.” Capsules are typically manufactured using a two piece gelatin shell formed by dipping a steel rod into gelatin so that the gelatin coats the end of the rod. The gelatin is hardened into two half-shells and the rod extracted. The hardened half-shells are then filled with a powder and the two halves joined together to form the capsule. (See generally, H<smallcaps>OWARD </smallcaps>C. A<smallcaps>NSEL ET AL</smallcaps><i>., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems </i>(7th Ed. 1999).)</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gelatin-coated tablets, commonly known as geltabs and gelcaps, are an improvement on gelatin capsules and typically comprise a tablet coated with a gelatin shell. Several well known examples of gelcaps are McNeil Consumer Healthcare's acetaminophen based products sold under the trade name Tylenol®. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,820,524; 5,538,125; 5,228,916; 5,436,026; 5,679,406; 5,415,868; 5,824,338; 5,089,270; 5,213,738; 5,464,631; 5,795,588; 5,511,361; 5,609,010; 5,200,191; 5,459,983; 5,146,730; 5,942,034 describe geltabs and gelcaps and methods and apparatuses for making them. Conventional methods for forming gelcaps are generally performed in a batchwise manner using a number of stand alone machines operating independently. Such batch processes typically include the unit operations of granulating, drying, blending, compacting (e.g., in a tablet press), gelatin dipping or enrobing, drying, and printing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, these processes have certain drawbacks. For example, because these systems are batch processes, each of the various apparatuses employed is housed in a separate clean room that must meet FDA standards. This requires a relatively large amount of capital in terms of both space and machinery. A process that would increase and streamline production rates would therefore provide many economic benefits including a reduction in the size of facilities needed to mass produce pharmaceutical products. Generally, it would be desirable to create a continuous operation process, as opposed to a batch process, for formation of gelcaps and other dosage forms.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, gel dipping and drying operations are in general relatively time consuming. Thus, a process that simplifies the gelatin coating operation in particular and reduces drying time would also be advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current equipment for making gelcaps and geltabs is designed to produce these forms only according to precise specifications of size and shape. A more versatile method and apparatus, which could be used to produce a variety of dosage forms to deliver pharmaceuticals, nutritionals, and/or confections, would therefore also be advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, applicants have now discovered that a wide variety of dosage forms, including compressed tablets, gelcaps, chewable tablets, liquid fill tablets, high potency dosage forms, and the like, some of which in and of themselves are novel, can be made using unique operating modules. Each operating module performs distinct functions, and therefore may be used as a stand alone unit to make certain dosage forms. Alternatively, two or more of the same or different operating modules may be linked together to form a continuous process for producing other dosage forms. In essence, a “mix and match” system for the production of dosage forms is provided by the present invention. Preferably, the operating modules may be linked together as desired to operate as a single continuous process.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The methods, systems, and apparatuses of this invention can be used to manufacture conventional dosage forms, having a variety of shapes and sizes, as well as novel dosage forms that could not have been manufactured heretofore using conventional systems and methods. In its most general sense, the invention provides: 1) a compression module for making compressed dosage forms from compressible powders, 2) a thermal cycle molding module for making molded dosage forms, or for applying a coating to a substrate, 3) a thermal setting molding module for making molded dosage forms, which may take the form of inserts for dosage forms, 4) a transfer device for transferring dosage forms from one module to another, and 5) a process for making dosage forms comprising at least two of the above modules linked together, preferably via the transfer device. Such process may be run on a continuous or indexing basis.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a preferred method for producing certain dosage forms according to the invention, which employs all of the operating modules linked into a continuous process. In particular, the method reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> produces a dosage form <b>10</b> comprising a molded coating <b>18</b> on the outside surface of a compressed dosage form <b>12</b> also containing an insert <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> depict a preferred system for practicing the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an alternative dosage form <b>10</b>′ that may be made according to the invention comprising a molded coating <b>18</b>′ over a compressed dosage form <b>12</b>′. It may be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> that the coating and the compressed dosage form need not have the same shape.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">By way of overview, this preferred system <b>20</b> comprises a compression module <b>100</b>, a thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> and a transfer device <b>300</b> for transferring a compressed dosage form made in the compression module <b>100</b> to the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Linkage of the compression module, transfer device, and the thermal cycle molding module in this manner results in a continuous, multi-station system. Compression is accomplished in the first module, molding of a coating around the resulting compressed dosage form is performed in the second module, and transfer of the dosage form from one module to the other is accomplished by the transfer device.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In other preferred embodiments, the system <b>20</b> also includes a thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> for forming a molded dosage form, which may comprise the final dosage form or be an insert for incorporation into another dosage form. In a preferred embodiment, the insert comprises a high potency additive. The invention is not limited to the type or nature of insert. Rather, the term insert is used simply to denote a pellet-type component embedded in another dosage form. Such an insert may itself contain a medicant, and retains its shape while being placed within the powder.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">When used in the preferred, linked system comprising a compression module, the insert is formed in Step B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Following this, the insert is inserted into uncompressed powder within compression module <b>100</b>. After insertion the powder and insert are compressed (Step C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> can be separate from or part of the compression module <b>100</b>. If the thermal setting molding module is separate from the compression module <b>100</b>, a transfer device <b>700</b> can be used to transfer the insert from the thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> to the compression module <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The linked system for creating dosage forms, as well as each individual operating module, provide many processing advantages. The operating modules may be used separately or together, in different sequences, depending on the nature of the dosage form desired. Two or more of the same operating modules may be used in a single process. And although the apparatuses, methods and systems of this invention are described with respect to making dosage forms, it will be appreciated that they can be used to produce non-medicinal products as well. For example, they may be used to make confections or placebos. The molding module can be used with numerous natural and synthetic materials with or without the presence of a medicant. Similarly, the compression module can be used with various powders with or without drug. These examples are provided by way of illustration and not by limitation, and it will be appreciated that the inventions described herein have numerous other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When linked in a continuous process, the operating modules can each be powered individually or jointly. In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a single motor <b>50</b> powers the compression module <b>100</b>, the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b>, and the transfer device <b>300</b>. The motor <b>50</b> can be coupled to the compression module <b>100</b>, the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> and the transfer device <b>300</b> by any conventional drive train, such as one comprising gears, gear boxes, line shafts, pulleys, and/or belts. Of course, such a motor or motors can be used to power other equipment in the process, such as the dryer <b>500</b> and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Compression Module</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-25</figref> generally depict the compression module <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a three dimensional view of the compression module <b>100</b> and the transfer device <b>300</b>. The compression module <b>100</b> is a rotary device that performs the following functions: feeding powder to a cavity, compacting the powder into a compressed dosage form and then ejecting the compressed dosage form. When the compression module is used in conjunction with the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b>, upon ejection from the compression module the compressed dosage form may be transferred to the molding module either directly or through the use of a transfer device, such as transfer device <b>300</b> described below. Optionally, an insert formed by another apparatus, such as the thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> described below, can be inserted into the powder in the compression module before the powder is compressed into the compressed dosage form.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In order to accomplish these functions the compression module <b>100</b> preferably has a plurality of zones or stations, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, including a fill zone <b>102</b>, an insertion zone <b>104</b>, a compression zone <b>106</b>, an ejection zone <b>108</b> and a purge zone <b>110</b>. Thus, within a single rotation of the compression module <b>100</b> each of these functions are accomplished and further rotation of the compression module <b>100</b> repeats the cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>14</b>, the rotary portion of the compression module generally includes an upper rotor <b>112</b>, a circular die table <b>114</b>, a lower rotor <b>116</b>, a plurality of upper <b>118</b> and lower <b>120</b> punches, an upper cam <b>122</b>, a lower cam <b>123</b> and a plurality of dies <b>124</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts a portion of the rotors <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, and die table <b>114</b> from a side view, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts a vertical cross-section through the rotors <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and die table <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> depicts an annular cross-section through rotors <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and die table <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> are two dimensional representations of the circular path the punches <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> follow as they rotate with respect to the cams <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> with the rotors removed from the drawing for purposes of illustration.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Each of the rotors <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> and the die table <b>114</b> include a plurality of cavities <b>126</b> which are disposed along the circumferences of the rotors and die table.

Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> only shows the die table <b>114</b>, it will be appreciated that the upper <b>112</b> and lower rotors <b>116</b> each have the same number of cavities <b>126</b>. The cavities <b>126</b> of each rotor are aligned with a cavity <b>126</b> in each of the other rotors and the die table. There are likewise preferably two circular rows of upper punches <b>118</b> and two circular rows of lower punches <b>120</b>, as best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts the outer row of punches, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the inner row of punches.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Conventional rotary tablet presses are of a single row design and contain one powder feed zone, one compression zone and one ejection zone. This is generally referred to as a single sided press since tablets are ejected from one side thereof. Presses offering a higher output version of the single row tablet press employing two powder feed zones, two tablet compression zones and two tablet ejection zones are commercially available. These presses are typically twice the diameter of the single sided version, have more punches and dies, and eject tablets from two sides thereof. They are referred to as double sided presses.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In a preferred embodiment of the invention the compression module described herein is constructed with two concentric rows of punches and dies. This double row construction provides for an output equivalent to two single side presses, yet fits into a small, compact space roughly equal to the space occupied by one conventional single sided press. This also provides a simplified construction by using a single fill zone <b>102</b>, a single compression zone <b>106</b>, and a single ejection zone <b>108</b>. A single ejection zone <b>108</b> is particularly advantageous in the linked process of the invention, because the complexity of multiple transfer devices <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> having double sided construction is avoided. Of course, a compression module with one row or more than two rows can also be constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The upper punches <b>118</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> extend from above the cavities <b>126</b> in the upper rotor <b>112</b> through the cavities <b>126</b> in the upper rotor and, depending on their position, either proximal to or within the cavities <b>126</b> of the die table <b>114</b>. Similarly, the lower punches extend from beneath the cavities <b>126</b> in the lower rotor <b>116</b> and into the cavities <b>126</b> in the die table <b>114</b>, as is also best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>. The cavities <b>148</b> in the upper and lower rotors serve as guides for the upper <b>118</b> and lower <b>120</b> punches respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Disposed within each of the cavities <b>126</b> of the die table is a die <b>124</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-14</figref> depict the dies <b>124</b> and cross sections through the die table <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a partial cross section of the die table <b>114</b> taken along an arc through a portion of the die table <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a cross section taken vertically along a radius though the die table <b>114</b>. Because there are preferably two circular rows of dies, the two rows of dies lie along two concentric radii, as best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Preferably, the dies <b>124</b> are metallic, but any suitable material will suffice. Each die <b>124</b> may be retained by any of a variety of fastening techniques within the respective cavity <b>126</b> of the die table <b>114</b>. For example, the dies <b>124</b> may be shaped so as to have a flange <b>128</b> that rests on a seating surface <b>130</b> formed in the die table <b>114</b> and a pair of o-rings <b>144</b> and grooves <b>146</b>, as best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an enlarged view of the dies shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> without the upper punches inserted into the dies. It will be appreciated that all the dies <b>124</b> are similar in construction.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Each die <b>124</b> comprises a die cavity <b>132</b> for receiving the upper and lower punches <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. The die cavities <b>132</b> and the lower punches <b>118</b> that extend a distance into the die cavities <b>132</b> define the volume of powder to be formed into the compressed dosage form and hence the dosage amount. Thus, the size of die cavity <b>132</b> and the degree of insertion of the punches into the die cavities <b>132</b> can be appropriately selected or adjusted to obtain the proper dosage.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In a preferred embodiment, the die cavities are filled using the assistance of a vacuum. Specifically, each die <b>124</b> has at least one port <b>134</b> disposed within it, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>, and <b>12</b>. Disposed within or proximal to each port <b>134</b> is a filter <b>136</b>. The filters <b>136</b> are generally a metallic mesh or screen appropriately sized for the particles that will be flowing through the die cavities <b>134</b>. One surprising feature of the present compression module is that the filters may comprise screens having a mesh size larger than the average particle size of the powder, which is typically about 50 to about 300 microns. While the filters <b>136</b> are preferably metallic, other suitable materials may be employed, such as fabrics, porous metals or porous polymer constructions. The filter <b>136</b> may be a single stage or multi-stage filter, but in the preferred embodiment the filter <b>136</b> is a single stage filter. The filter may also be located anywhere in the vacuum passages. Alternatively, it can be located externally to the die table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. In a preferred embodiment the filters are located in the die wall ports <b>134</b> as close as possible to the punches. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. This creates the least amount of residue requiring purging and subsequent recycling in the purge zone <b>110</b> and powder recovery system. The top of the die cavity <b>132</b> is preferably open and defines a second port.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The die table <b>114</b> preferably comprises channels <b>138</b> within it that circle each pair of dies <b>124</b> and extend to the ports <b>134</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In addition the die table <b>114</b> preferably has a plurality of relatively small openings <b>140</b> on its outer periphery that connect each of the respective channels <b>138</b>, so that the die cavities can be connected to a vacuum source (or suction source). Disposed along a portion of the periphery of the die table <b>114</b> are a stationary vacuum pump <b>158</b> and a vacuum manifold <b>160</b>, which make up a portion of the fill zone <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The vacuum pump <b>158</b> provides a source of vacuum for pulling powder into the die cavities <b>132</b>. The vacuum pump <b>158</b> is connected to the vacuum manifold <b>160</b> with suitable tubing <b>162</b>. The vacuum manifold <b>160</b> is aligned with the openings <b>140</b>. As the die table <b>114</b> rotates during operation of the vacuum pump <b>158</b>, the openings <b>140</b> in the die table <b>114</b> become aligned with the vacuum manifold <b>160</b> and a vacuum is formed through the respective channel <b>138</b> and die cavity <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Vacuum is accordingly applied through the respective ports <b>134</b> and channels <b>138</b> to pull powder into the die cavity <b>132</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>. A seal can be created around the ports <b>134</b> and the channel <b>138</b> proximal to the port <b>134</b> with any of a variety of techniques. In the preferred embodiment shown a seal is created using o-rings <b>144</b> and grooves <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Conventional tablet presses rely on highly flowable powders and the effects of gravity to fill the die cavity. The performance of these machines in terms of fill accuracy and press speed are therefore entirely dependent on the quality and flowabilty of the powder. Since non-flowing and poorly flowing powders cannot be effectively run on these machines these materials must be wet granulated in a separate batch process which is costly, time consuming, and energy inefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The preferred vacuum fill system described is advantageous over conventional systems in that poorly flowing and non-flowing powders can be run at high speed and high accuracy without the need for wet granulation. In particular, powders having a minimum orifice diameter of flowability greater than about 10, preferably 15, more preferably 25 mm, as measured by the Flowdex test, may be successfully compressed into dosage forms in the present compression module. The Flowdex test is performed as follows. The minimum orifice diameter is determined using a Flodex Apparatus Model 21-101-050 (Hanson Research Corp., Chatsworth, Calif.), which consists of a cylindrical cup for holding the powder sample (diameter 5.7 cm, height 7.2 cm), and a set of interchangeable disks, each with a different diameter round opening at the center. The disks are attached to the cylindrical cup to form the bottom of the “cup.” For filling, the orifice is covered with a clamp. Minimum orifice diameter measurements are performed using 100 g samples of powder. A 100 g sample is placed into the cup. After 30 seconds the clamp is removed, and the powder allowed to flow out of the cup through the orifice. This procedure is repeated with increasingly smaller orifice diameters until the powder no longer flows freely through the orifice. The minimum orifice diameter is defined as the smallest opening through which the powder flows freely.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Moreover, compression of such relatively poorly flowing powders may be done while operating the compression module at high speeds, i.e., the linear velocity of the dies is typically at least about 115 cm/sec, preferably at least about 230 cm/sec. In addition, weight variations in the final compressed dosage forms are significantly less, since vacuum filling of the die cavity causes a densifying effect on the powder in the die cavity. This minimizes the density variations powders typically exhibit due to compaction, static head pressure variation, or lack of blend homogeneity. The relative standard deviation in weight of compressed dosage forms made according to the invention is typically less than about 2%, preferably less than about 1%.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In addition, better content uniformity can also be achieved with the present vacuum fill system, since little mechanical agitation is required to cause the powder to flow into the die cavity. In conventional tablet presses, the mechanical agitation required to assure die filling has the adverse effect of segregating small from large particles.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Known powder filling equipment employ vacuum to fill uncompressed powders into capsules or other containers. See. For example, Aronson, U.S. Pat. No. 3,656,518 assigned to Perry Industries, Inc. However, these systems have filters that are always in contact with the powder and therefore unsuitable for adaptation to compression machines. Forces on the order of 100 kN can be experienced during compression of powders into dosage forms. Such high forces would damage the filters. U.S. Pat. No. 4,292,017 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,392,493 to Doepel describe a high speed rotary tablet compression machine which uses vacuum die filling. However separate turntables are used for filling and compression. Dies are filled on the first turntable and thereafter transferred to a separate turntable for compression. Advantageously, according to the invention, the filters are protected during compression, since the lower punches move above the filter port prior to the die cavities entering the compression zone.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Powder is fed into the die cavities <b>132</b> in the fill zone <b>102</b>. The powder may preferably consist of a medicant optionally containing various excipients, such as binders, disintegrants, lubricants, fillers and the like, as is conventional, or other particulate material of a medicinal or non-medicinal nature, such as inactive placebo blends for tableting, confectionery blends, and the like. One particularly preferred formulation comprises medicant, powdered wax (such as shellac wax, microcrystalline wax, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and optionally disintegrants and lubricants and is described in more detail in commonly assigned co-pending U.S. Pat. Application Ser. No. 09/966,493, entitled “Immediate Release Tablet” (attorney docket number MCP 274) which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Suitable medicants include for example pharmaceuticals, minerals, vitamins and other nutraceuticals. Suitable pharmaceuticals include analgesics, decongestants, expectorants, antitussives, antihistamines, gastrointestinal agents, diuretics, bronchodilators, sleep-inducing agents and mixtures thereof. Preferred pharmaceuticals include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, chlorpheniramine maleate, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, famotidine, loperamide, ranitidine, cimetidine, astemizole, terfenadine, fexofenadine, loratadine, cetirizine, antacids, mixtures thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. More preferably, the medicant is selected from the group consisting of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, pseudoephedrine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, aluminum hydroxide, mixtures thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The medicant(s) is present in the dosage form in a therapeutically effective amount, which is an amount that produces the desired therapeutic response upon oral administration and can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. In determining such amounts, the particular medicant being administered, the bioavailability characteristics of the medicant, the dose regime, the age and weight of the patient, and other factors must be considered, as known in the art. Preferably, the compressed dosage form comprises at least about 85 weight percent of medicant.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">If the medicant has an objectionable taste, and the dosage form is intended to be chewed or disintegrated in the mouth prior to swallowing, the medicant may be coated with a taste masking coating, as known in the art. Examples of suitable taste masking coatings are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,851,226, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,114, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,436. Commercially available taste masked medicants may also be employed. For example, acetaminophen particles which are encapsulated with ethylcellulose or other polymers by a coaccervation process may be used in the present invention. Coaccervation-encapsulated acetaminophen may be purchased commercially from Eurand America, Inc. Vandalia, Ohio, or from Circa Inc., Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Suitable excipients include fillers, which include water-soluble compressible carbohydrates such as dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, lactose, and mixtures thereof, water insoluble plasticly deforming materials such as microcrystalline cellulose or other cellulosic derivatives, water-insoluble brittle fracture materials such as dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and the like; other conventional dry binders such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and the like; sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, and saccharin; lubricants, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, and waxes; and glidants, such as colloidal silicon dioxide. The mixture may also incorporate pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, including, for example, preservatives, flavors, antioxidants, surfactants, and coloring agents. Preferably however, the powder is substantially free of water soluble polymeric binders and hydrated polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Included within the fill zone <b>102</b> may be a doctor blade <b>131</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that “doctors” or levels the powder along the die table <b>114</b> as the die table <b>114</b> rotates through the fill zone <b>102</b>. In particular, as a filled die cavity <b>132</b> rotates past the powder bed, the die table <b>114</b> passes against the doctor blade <b>131</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) which scrapes the surface of the die table <b>114</b> to assure the precise leveling and measurement of powder filling the die cavity <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">After the punches leave the fill zone <b>102</b> they enter the insertion zone <b>104</b>. In this zone the lower punches <b>120</b> may retract slightly to allow for an optional insert to be embedded into the soft uncompressed powder in the die cavity <b>132</b> via a transfer device <b>700</b>. This mechanism is described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">After continued rotation and before entering the compression zone <b>106</b>, the upper punch <b>118</b> is pushed into the die cavity <b>132</b> by the cam track <b>122</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>16</b>. Following this, the upper and lower punches <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> engage the first stage rollers <b>180</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> where force is applied to the powder via the first stage rollers. After this initial compression event, the punches enter the second stage rollers <b>182</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The second stage rollers <b>182</b> drive the punches <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> into the die cavity <b>132</b> to further compress the powder into the desired compressed dosage form. Once past the compression zone the upper punches retract from the die cavity <b>132</b> and the lower punches begin to move upward prior to entering the ejection zone <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Because the distances traveled by the outer and inner rows of punches along their respective circular paths differ, the sizes of the rollers <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> that activate each row differ. This enables compression of the inner and outer rows to be simultaneous. In particular, the rollers that activate the inner row are smaller in diameter than the rollers that activate the outer row (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), but the inner and outer rollers have their greatest diameter along the same radial line. Thus, the outer row punches and inner row punches will each begin to be compressed at the same time, thus entering the die cavities simultaneously. By assuring the same dwell time under compression, consistency of compressed dosage form thickness between inner and outer rows is assured. This thickness control is particularly important should the compressed dosage forms be subjected to subsequent operations, such as the application of coatings and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref>, <b>18</b>, and <b>19</b> are three possible geometries for the compression frame on which the compression rollers are mounted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates one possible “C” geometry for the compression frame. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 17C</figref> deflection of the compression frame displaces the rollers by the amount “Δ” under the significant forces of compression (The double row compression module illustrated here preferably has twice this rating or 200 kN.) An advantage of the frame geometry depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A through 17C</figref> is that the displacement A is parallel to the radial axis of the compression rollers <b>182</b>. This slight deflection can easily be compensated for by thickness controls on the machine. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the frame occupies a significant amount of space. Accordingly there is less room for other equipment to be mounted on or near the compression module (this is represented by angle φ).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A through 18C</figref> illustrate an alternate “C” frame geometry. This arrangement has the advantage of occupying significantly less space than the arrangement outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A through 17C</figref>. However in this embodiment, deflection of the compression frame displaces the rollers out of the horizontal plane. This is represented by angle θ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>. θ increases as the load increases. The net effect is an inconsistency between inner and outer row compressed dosage form thickness that also varies with compression force.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A through 19D</figref> illustrate a preferred embodiment of the compression frame. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref>, the frame comprises a throat <b>179</b> and two arms <b>178</b>. The arms <b>178</b> forms an oblique angle Ω with respect to the axial axis of the rollers A-A. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19B and 19D</figref> despite deflection of the frame and displacement Δ of the rollers, the rollers remain horizontal. An additional advantage of this construction is a significantly greater free space angle <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>. This compression frame configuration can also advantageously pivot about an axis away from the compression module to allow for access or removal of the die table.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Following the formation of the compressed dosage form in the compression zone <b>106</b>, the respective die cavity <b>132</b> rotates to ejection zone <b>108</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The upper punches <b>118</b> move upward due to the slope of the cam tracks <b>122</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>16</b> and out of the die cavities. The lower punches <b>120</b> move upward and into the die cavities <b>132</b> until eventually the lower punches <b>120</b> eject the compressed dosage form out of the die cavity <b>132</b>, and optionally into a transfer device <b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the purge zone <b>110</b>, excess powder is removed from the filters <b>136</b> after the compressed dosage form has been ejected from the die cavities <b>132</b>. This cleans the filters before the next filling operation. The purge zone <b>110</b> accomplishes this by blowing air through or placing suction pressure on the filters <b>136</b> and channels <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In a preferred embodiment the purge zone <b>110</b> includes a stationary positive pressure source <b>190</b>, such as an air pump or pressurized air bank, and a pressure manifold <b>192</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The pressure manifold <b>192</b> may be disposed proximal to the periphery of the die table <b>114</b> and between the compression zone <b>106</b> and the fill zone <b>102</b>, as best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</figref>. The pressure manifold <b>192</b> preferably has at least one port <b>194</b> (although any number of ports can be used) that can be placed in fluid communication with the filters as the die table <b>114</b> rotates. Pressure source <b>190</b> applies pressure through tubing <b>196</b> and the pressure manifold <b>192</b> to each respective channel <b>138</b> and die cavity <b>132</b> as the die table <b>114</b> rotates and the openings <b>140</b> become aligned with the pressure manifold ports <b>194</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 22</figref>. It will be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> that in the purge zone <b>110</b> the upper punches <b>118</b> are removed from the die cavities <b>132</b> and the lower punches <b>120</b> are disposed beneath the filters <b>136</b>, so that pressure can be applied through the openings <b>140</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. When the lower punch <b>120</b> is inserted into the die cavity <b>132</b> above the filters <b>136</b> and die ports <b>134</b>, die cavity <b>132</b> is disconnected from the vacuum source <b>142</b>, and vacuum is no longer exerted on the powder.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The positive pressure cleans out the filters to remove any buildup of powder by transmitting pressurized air from the pressure manifold through the channels and through the die cavities. The pressurized air blows the powder up through the top of the die cavities to a collection manifold <b>193</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22</figref>, <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. From the collection manifold, the powder can be sent to a collection chamber or the like and if desired reused.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In order to increase the efficiency of the purge zone <b>110</b>, the purge zone <b>110</b> may further include a suction source <b>197</b> that applies suction to the collection manifold <b>193</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> and a collection chamber <b>193</b> that receives the powder from the suction source <b>197</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">If desired the purge zone <b>110</b> can include a recovery system to recover the removed powder and send it back to hopper <b>169</b> or the powder bed <b>171</b>. This is advantageous because it minimizes waste. One embodiment of the recovery system is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>. The recovery system feeds the purged powder into the die cavities <b>132</b> prior to their arrival at the fill zone <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the recovery system includes shoe block <b>195</b>, a blower <b>197</b>, a cyclone receiver <b>199</b>, a delivery manifold <b>198</b>, and an agitator <b>191</b>. The shoe block <b>195</b> is disposed about and contacts a portion of the periphery of the die table <b>114</b> between the pressure manifold <b>192</b> and the fill zone <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The shoe block <b>195</b> may be spring loaded by springs <b>189</b> so that it fits tightly against the die table <b>114</b> as the die table <b>114</b> rotates past it. The shoe block <b>195</b> is aligned with the openings <b>140</b> in the die table <b>114</b> to create a pressure seal between the openings <b>140</b> and the shoe block <b>189</b>. This pressure seal prevents purged powder in the die cavities <b>132</b> from being blown back out of the die cavities. Alternately, shoe block <b>195</b> can be dispensed with if the lower punches <b>120</b> are moved upward to cover the die ports <b>134</b> and then moved down again prior to entering the fill zone <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The blower <b>197</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is coupled to the collection manifold <b>193</b> to pull powder from the die cavities <b>132</b>. The blower <b>197</b> sends purged powder from the collection manifold <b>193</b> to the cyclone dust separator <b>199</b>, which operates at a partial vacuum. The cyclone dust separator <b>199</b> collects the purged powder and sends it to the delivery manifold <b>198</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. A filter bag dust separator can be substituted for the cyclone dust separator. Once the dust is separated from the air stream <b>199</b> it falls into the delivery manifold <b>198</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref></p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The delivery manifold <b>198</b> is disposed just above the die table <b>114</b> so that as the die table <b>114</b> rotates, the top of the die table <b>114</b> comes into contact with the delivery manifold <b>198</b>, creating a pressure seal between the delivery manifold <b>198</b> and the die table <b>114</b>. The die cavities are open to the delivery manifold <b>198</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> so that purged powder can flow into the die cavities by gravity or other means such as an optional vacuum source (not shown). The agitator <b>191</b> rotates within the delivery manifold <b>198</b> to direct the purged powder to the die cavities <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In operation, the die table <b>114</b> rotates proximal to the pressure manifold <b>192</b> and beneath the collection manifold <b>193</b>. As described above, pressurized air is sent through the openings <b>140</b> in the periphery of the die table and vacuum is applied to the collection manifold <b>193</b> and the two together cause powder to flow from the channels <b>138</b> and the die cavities <b>132</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> to the collection manifold <b>193</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">From the collection manifold <b>193</b>, the purged powder flows to the cyclone dust separator <b>199</b> where the purged powder is directed to the agitator <b>191</b> and the delivery manifold <b>198</b>. The die table <b>114</b> continues to rotate so that the purged die cavities <b>132</b> pass to the shoe block <b>195</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The openings <b>140</b> of the die cavities are sealed by the shoe block <b>195</b> so that powder can flow into the die cavities <b>132</b>, but will not flow out of the openings <b>140</b>. The delivery manifold <b>198</b> directs the purged powder from the cyclone dust separator <b>199</b> back into the die cavities <b>132</b>. Following this, the die table <b>114</b> continues to rotate to the fill zone <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">An alternate embodiment of the powder recovery system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. This embodiment dispenses with the delivery manifold <b>198</b> and shoe block <b>195</b>. Purged powder is delivered back into the fill zone <b>102</b> rather than into the die cavity <b>134</b>. A rotary valve <b>125</b> is employed to prevent powder from powder bed <b>171</b> from entering the cyclone dust separator <b>199</b>. A series of two gate or flap valves (not shown) may also be used in place of the rotary valve <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The above systems for purging the powder from the die cavities <b>132</b> and channels <b>138</b> prevents powder build-up and minimizes waste. Of course, this invention in its broadest sense can be practiced without such a purge zone <b>110</b> or a recovery system.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Thermal Cycle Molding Module</heading>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> may function in one of several different ways. It may for example be used to form a shell or coating over at least part of a dosage form such as a compressed dosage form such as a tablet. It may also be used as stand alone equipment to produce a molded dosage form per se. Such a coating or dosage form is made from a flowable material. Preferably, the molding module is used to apply a coating of flowable material to a dosage form. More preferably, the molding module is used to apply a coating of a flowable material to a compressed dosage form made in a compression module of the invention and transferred via a transfer device also according to the invention. The coating is formed within the molding module by injecting the flowable material, preferably comprising a natural or synthetic polymer, into a mold assembly around the dosage form. The flowable material may or may not comprise a medicant and appropriate excipients, as desired. Alternately, the molding module may be used to apply a coating of flowable material to a molded dosage form, or other substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Advantageously, the thermal cycle molding module may be used to apply smooth coatings to substrates that are irregular in topography. The coating thickness achieved with the thermal cycle molding module typically ranges from about 100 to about 400 microns. However, the relative standard deviation in the thickness of the coating can be as high as about 30%. This means the outside of the coated dosage form can be made to be highly regular and smooth, even if the substrate below it is not. Once coated, the relative standard deviations in thickness and diameter of the coated dosage form are typically not greater than about 0.35%. Typical coated dosage form thicknesses (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref> as t) are on the order of about 4 to 10 mm, while typical coated dosage form diameters (d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref>) range from about 5 to about 15 mm. It should be noted that subcoats, which are often present in conventional dosage forms, are not necessary on dosage forms coated using the thermal cycle molding module.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> preferably cycles between hot and cold temperatures during operation. Preferably, the actual mold cavity is held at a temperature generally above the melting point or gel point of the flowable material during injection and filling thereof. After the mold cavity is filled its is quickly decreased to below the melting point or gel point of the flowable material thus causing it to solidify or set. The mold itself is thin like an “egg shell,” and constructed of a material with a high thermal conductivity, such that the mass and geometry of the mold have a negligible effect on the speed at which this thermal cycle is accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">A significant advantage, then, of the thermal cycle molding module is the dramatically reduced cycle times it affords due to the fact that it can cycle between temperatures that are relatively far apart. The temperature differential between the actual mold cavity and the flowable material is the major driving force in the solidification rate of the flowable material. By substantially increasing this rate higher equipment output can be achieved and subsequent savings in equipment, labor, and plant infrastructure can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Moreover, molding of gelatin or similar materials, for example non-polymers such as the basic elements, metals, water, and alcohol, have not previously been possible using conventional molding techniques such as injection molding. Precise control over the temperature and pressure of such materials, as well as the mold cavity temperature are required to assure these materials are sufficiently flowable to fill the mold cavity completely. On the other hand, the mold cavity must subsequently be cooled enough to assure that the material will eventually solidify. In particular, gelatin, once hydrated, has a very abrupt transition temperature between the liquid phase and the solid or gel phase. It therefore cannot be characterized as a thermoplastic material. Accordingly, in order to mold gelatin and materials like it the temperature of the mold must cycle from a first temperature above its melting or gel point (to assure that the material will flow and completely fill the mold cavity) to a second temperature below its melting or gel point (to solidify it).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the flowable material comprises gelatin. Gelatin is a natural, thermogelling polymer. It is a tasteless and colorless mixture of derived proteins of the albuminous class which is ordinarily soluble in warm water. Two types of gelatin—Type A and Type B—are commonly used. Type A gelatin is a derivative of acid-treated raw materials. Type B gelatin is a derivative of alkali-treated raw materials. The moisture content of gelatin, as well as its Bloom strength, composition and original gelatin processing conditions, determine its transition temperature between liquid and solid. Bloom is a standard measure of the strength of a gelatin gel, and is roughly correlated with molecular weight. Bloom is defined as the weight in grams required to move a half-inch diameter plastic plunger 4 mm into a 6.67% gelatin gel that has been held at 10° C. for 17 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In a preferred embodiment wherein the flowable material is an aqueous solution comprising 20% 275 Bloom pork skin gelatin, 20% 250 Bloom Bone Gelatin, and approximately 60% water, the mold cavities are cycled between about 35° C., and about 20° C. in about 2 seconds (a total of 4 seconds per cycle).</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Other preferred flowable materials comprise polymeric substances such as polysaccharides, cellulosics, proteins, low and high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (including polyethylene oxide), and methacrylic acid and methacrylate ester copolymers. Alternative flowable materials include sucrose-fatty acid esters; fats such as cocoa butter, hydrogenated vegetable oil such as palm kernel oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, and soybean oil; mono- di- and triglycerides, phospholipids, waxes such as Carnauba wax, spermaceti wax, beeswax, candelilla wax, shellac wax, microcrystalline wax, and paraffin wax; fat-containing mixtures such as chocolate; sugar in the form on an amorphous glass such as that used to make hard candy forms, sugar in a supersaturated solution such as that used to make fondant forms; carbohydrates such as sugar-alcohols (for example, sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, xylitol), or thermoplastic starch; and low-moisture polymer solutions such as mixtures of gelatin and other hydrocolloids at water contents up to about 30%, such as for example those used to make “gummi” confection forms.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The flowable material may optionally comprise adjuvants or excipients, in which may comprise up to about 20% by weight of the flowable material. Examples of suitable adjuvants or excipients include plasticizers, detackifiers, humectants, surfactants, anti-foaming agents, colorants, flavorants, sweeteners, opacifiers, and the like. In one preferred embodiment, the flowable material comprises less than 5% humectants, or alternately is substantially free of humectants, such as glycerin, sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, or propylene glycol. Humectants have traditionally been included in pre-formed films employed in enrobing processes, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,730 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,983, assigned to Banner Gelatin Products Corp., in order to ensure adequate flexibility or plasticity and bondability of the film during processing. Humectants function by binding water and retaining it in the film. Pre-formed films used in enrobing processes can typically comprise up to 45% water. Disadvantageously, the presence of humectant prolongs the drying process, and can adversely affect the stability of the finished dosage form.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Advantageously, drying of the dosage form after it has left the thermal cycle molding module not is required when the moisture content of the flowable material is less than about 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Whether coating a dosage form or preparing a dosage form per se, use of the thermal cycling molding module advantageously avoids visible defects in the surface of the product produced. Known injection molding processes utilize sprues and runners to feed moldable material into the mold cavity. This results in product defects such as injector marks, sprue defects, gate defects, and the like. In conventional molds, sprues and runners must be broken off after solidification, leaving a defect at the edge of the part, and generating scrap. In conventional hot runner molds, sprues are eliminated, however a defect is produced at the injection point since the hot runner nozzle must momentarily contact the chilled mold cavity during injection. As the tip of the nozzle retracts it pulls a “tail” with it, which must be broken off. This defect is particularly objectionable with stringy or sticky materials. Unwanted defects of this nature would be particularly disadvantageous for swallowable dosage forms, not only from a cosmetic standpoint but functionally as well. The sharp and jagged edges would irritate or scratch the mouth, tongue and throat.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The thermal cycle molding module avoids these problems. It employs nozzle systems (referred to herein as valve assemblies) each comprising a valve body, valve stem and valve body tip. After injection of flowable material into the mold cavity, the valve body tip closes the mold cavity while comforming seemlessly to the shape of the mold cavity. This technique eliminates visible defects in the molded product and also allows a wide range of heretofore unmoldable or difficult to mold materials to be used. Moreover, use of the thermal cycle molding module according to the invention avoids the production of scrap flowable material, in that substantially all of the flowable material becomes part of the finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">For convenience, the thermal cycle molding module is described generally herein as it is used to apply a coating to a compressed dosage form. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>, which is explained further below, depicts an embodiment in which molded dosage forms per se are made using the thermal cycle molding module.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> generally includes a rotor <b>202</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> around which a plurality of mold units <b>204</b> are disposed. As the rotor <b>202</b> revolves, the mold units <b>204</b> receive compressed dosage forms, preferably from a transfer device such as transfer device <b>300</b>. Next, flowable material is injected into the mold units to coat the compressed dosage forms. After the compressed dosage forms have been coated, the coating may be further hardened or dried if required. They may be hardened within the mold units or they may be transferred to another device such as a dryer. Continued revolution of the rotor <b>202</b> repeats the cycle for each mold unit.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a three dimensional view of the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> as described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is a partial view through a section of the thermal cycle molding module as viewed from above showing multiple mold units <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is a section through one of the mold units <b>204</b>. The thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> includes at least one reservoir <b>206</b> containing the flowable material, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. There may be a single reservoir for each mold unit, one reservoir for all the mold units, or multiple reservoirs that serve multiple mold units. In a preferred embodiment, flowable material of two different colors are used to make the coating, and there are two reservoirs <b>206</b>, one for each color. The reservoirs <b>206</b> may be mounted to the rotor <b>202</b> such that they rotate with the rotor <b>202</b>, or be stationary and connected to the rotor via a rotary union <b>207</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The reservoirs <b>206</b> can be heated to assist the flowable material in flowing. The temperature to which the flowable material should be heated of course depends on the nature of the flowable material. Any suitable heating means may be used, such as an electric (induction or resistance) heater or fluid heat transfer media. Any suitable tubing <b>208</b> may be used to connect the reservoirs <b>206</b> to the mold unit <b>204</b>. In a preferred embodiment, tubing <b>208</b> extends through each of the shafts <b>213</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref> to each of the center mold assemblies <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">A preferred embodiment of a mold unit <b>204</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The mold unit <b>204</b> includes a lower retainer <b>210</b>, an upper mold assembly <b>214</b>, and a center mold assembly <b>212</b>. Each lower retainer <b>210</b>, center mold assembly <b>212</b>, and upper mold assembly <b>214</b> are mounted to the rotor <b>202</b> by any suitable means, including but not limited to mechanical fasteners. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> depicts a single mold unit <b>204</b> all of the other mold units <b>204</b> are similar. The lower retainer <b>210</b> and the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> are mounted so that they can move vertically with respect to the center mold assembly <b>212</b>. The center mold assembly <b>212</b> is preferably rotatably mounted to the rotor <b>202</b> such that it may rotate 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref> depicts the sequence of steps for making a molded dosage form per se.

At the beginning of the cycle (the rotor at the 0 degree position) the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> and the center mold assembly <b>212</b> are in the open position. As the rotor continues to revolve the mold assemblies close to form a mold cavity. After the mold assemblies close, hot flowable material is injected from either the upper mold assembly, the center mold assembly, or both into the mold cavity. The temperature of the mold cavity is decreased, and a thermal cycle is completed. After the flowable material hardens, the mold assemblies open. Upon further revolution of the rotor, the finished molded dosage forms are ejected thus completing one full revolution of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> depicts the sequence of steps for using a second embodiment of the thermal cycle molding module. Here a coating is formed over a compressed dosage form. In this embodiment, the thermal cycle molding module coats the first half of a dosage form during revolution of the rotor <b>202</b> between 0 and 180 degrees. The second half of the dosage form is coated during revolution of the rotor between 180 and 360 degrees. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> is a timing diagram showing movement and rotation of the mold units as the rotor completes one revolution. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref> is a section through one of the mold units showing upper mold assembly <b>214</b> and center mold assembly <b>212</b>. Note that the center mold assembly <b>212</b> in this embodiment is capable of rotation about its axis.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">At the beginning of the molding cycle (rotor at the 0 degree position) the mold assemblies are in the open position. Center mold assembly <b>212</b> has received a compressed dosage form, for example from a compression module according to the invention transferred via a transfer device also according to the invention. As the rotor continues to revolve, the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> closes against center mold assembly <b>212</b>. Next, flowable material is injected into the mold cavity created by union of the mold assemblies to apply a shell to the first half of the compressed dosage form. The flowable material is cooled in the mold cavity. The mold assemblies open with the half coated compressed dosage forms remaining in the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>. Upon further revolution of the rotor, the center mold assembly rotates 180 degrees. As the rotor moves past 180 degrees the mold assemblies again close and the uncoated half of the compressed dosage form is covered with flowable material. A thermal cycle is completed with setting or hardening of the coating on the second half of the compressed dosage form. The mold assemblies again open and the coated compressed dosage form is ejected from the thermal cycle molding module.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref> depicts the sequence of steps for using a preferred embodiment of the thermal cycle molding module to form a coating over a compressed dosage form. In this embodiment, part of a compressed dosage form is coated in the mold cavity created by union of the lower retainer and the center mold assembly <b>212</b> during revolution of the rotor between 0 and 360 degrees. Simultaneously, the remainder of a second compressed dosage form, the first part of which has already been coated during a previous revolution of the rotor, is coated in the mold cavity created by the union of the center mold assembly and the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>. Compressed dosage forms transit through the thermal cycle molding module in a helix, receiving partial coatings during a first full rotation of the rotor, and then the remainder of their coatings during a second full rotation of the rotor. Compressed dosage forms are therefore retained in the thermal cycle molding module for two revolutions of the rotor (720 degrees) prior to being ejected as finished products. This embodiment of the thermal cycle molding module is advantageous in that size of the molding module may be drastically reduced, i.e., to one half the diameter of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> for a given dosage form output per rotation. This embodiment of the thermal cycle molding module is more economic to fabricate, operate, and house in a high output manufacturing plant.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref> is a timing diagram showing movement of the mold units and rotation of the center mold assembly as the rotor completes two revolutions (0 through 720 degrees). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref> is a section through one of the mold units. At the beginning of the cycle (0 degrees rotation of the rotor) the mold units are in the open position. The center mold assembly <b>212</b> contains a partially coated compressed dosage form. The lower mold assembly <b>210</b> receives an uncoated compressed dosage form, for example from a compression module <b>100</b> via a transfer device <b>300</b>. Upon rotation of the rotor, the center mold assembly <b>212</b> rotates 180 degrees about its axis, which is radial to the rotor. This presents the partially coated compressed dosage form to the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>, which is empty. The partially coated compressed dosage form is then disposed between the upper and center mold assemblies <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>. As the rotor continues to rotate, the mold units close. The lower retainer <b>210</b> and center mold assembly <b>212</b> create a seal around the uncoated compressed dosage form, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Flowable material is injected into the mold cavity created between the lower retainer <b>210</b> and the center mold assembly <b>212</b> over the uncoated compressed dosage form to cover a part thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the flowable material coats about half of the uncoated compressed dosage form, the top half as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. Simultaneously with the mating of the lower retainer <b>210</b> and the center mold assembly <b>212</b>, the center <b>212</b> and upper <b>214</b> mold assemblies mate to create seals around the partially coated compressed dosage form. Flowable material is injected through the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> into the mold cavity created by the center mold assembly and the upper mold assembly to coat the remaining portion of the partially coated compressed dosage form, the top portion as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. The lower retainer <b>210</b> and upper mold assembly <b>214</b> are mated with the center mold assembly <b>212</b> simultaneously. Accordingly, when an uncoated compressed dosage form is being partially coated between the lower retainer <b>210</b> and the center mold assembly <b>212</b>, the remainder of a partially coated compressed dosage form is being coated between the center <b>212</b> and upper mold assemblies <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Following this, the lower retainer and the mold assemblies separate. The fully coated compressed dosage form is retained in the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>. The partially coated compressed dosage form is retained in the center mold assembly <b>214</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The fully coated compressed dosage form is then ejected from the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. Following this, an uncoated compressed dosage form is transferred to the lower retainer <b>210</b>, such that the lower retainer <b>210</b>, center mold assembly <b>212</b>, and upper mold assembly <b>214</b> return to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. The process then repeats itself.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In the preferred embodiment shown, each mold unit can coat eight compressed dosage forms. Of course, the mold units can be constructed to coat any number of compressed dosage forms. Additionally and preferably, the compressed dosage forms are coated with two different colored flowable materials. Any colors can be used. Alternatively, only a portion of the compressed dosage form may be coated while the remainder is uncoated.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The molds may also be constructed to impart regular or irregular, continuous or discontinuous, coatings, i.e., of various portions and patterns, to the dosage forms. For example, dimple patterned coatings, similar to the surface of a golf ball, can be formed using a molding module comprising mold insert having dimple patterns on their surfaces. Alternatively, a circumferential portion of a dosage form can be coated with one flowable material and the remaining portions of the dosage form with another flowable material. Still another example of an irregular coating is a discontinuous coating comprising holes of uncoated portions around the dosage form. For example, the mold insert may have elements covering portions of the dosage form so that such covered portions are not coated with the flowable material. Letters or other symbols can be molded onto the dosage form. Finally, the present molding module allows for precise control of coating thickness on a dosage form.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">When used to form a coating on a dosage form, the molding module of this invention advantageously dispenses with the need for a subcoating on the dosage form. When conventional compressed dosage forms are coated by processes such as dipping, this generally requires placing a subcoating on the compressed dosage form prior to the dipping step.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Preferred embodiments of the lower retainer, center mold assembly and upper mold assembly are described below. These embodiments of the lower retainer, center mold assembly and upper mold assembly are part of a thermal cycle molding module for applying a coating to a compressed dosage form.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">1. The Lower Retainer</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The lower retainer <b>210</b> is mounted to the rotor <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> in any suitable fashion and comprises a plate <b>216</b> and a dosage form holder <b>217</b>. Each dosage form holder can be connected to the plate by any one of a variety of fastening techniques including without limitation snap rings and groves, nuts and bolts, adhesives and mechanical fasteners. Although the cross-section of the lower retainer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 through 35</figref> depicts only four dosage form holders <b>217</b>, the lower retainer preferably has four additional dosage form holders for a total of eight. Each dosage form holder includes a flanged outer sleeve <b>218</b>, an elastomeric collet <b>220</b>, a center support stem <b>222</b> and a plurality of flexible fingers <b>223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The configuration of the lower retainer is best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36-39</figref>. The center support stem <b>222</b> establishes the vertical position of the dosage form. The elastomeric collet <b>220</b> masks and seals the periphery of the dosage form, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>. Each elastomeric collet <b>220</b> mates with a corresponding portion of the center mold assembly <b>212</b> in order to create a seal around the dosage form. Although the elastomeric collets can be formed in a variety of shapes and sizes, in a preferred embodiment the elastomeric collets are generally circular and have a corrugated inside surface <b>221</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. The inside surface <b>221</b> comprises very small vent holes <b>224</b> for air to vent through when the lower retainer <b>210</b> is mated with the center mold assembly <b>212</b> and flowable material is injected over the top portion of the dosage form. The vent holes <b>224</b> are relatively small so that the flowable material injected over the dosage form from the center mold assembly <b>212</b> will generally not flow through the vent holes <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36-39</figref> disposed about the elastomeric collet <b>220</b> are flexible fingers <b>223</b>. The flexible fingers <b>223</b> are mounted within the lower retainer <b>210</b> by any suitable means and are attached to the support stem <b>222</b> to move up and down with the movement of the support stem <b>222</b>, as best understood by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>. The flexible fingers can be coupled to the center support stem by any of a variety of fastening techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In the preferred embodiment shown, the flexible fingers <b>223</b> are metal and spring radially outward when pushed out as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, so that a dosage form can be received by or released from an elastomeric collet <b>220</b>. The flexible fingers <b>223</b> move radially inward when retracted by the center support stem <b>222</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref> to hold the dosage form within the elastomeric collet <b>220</b> firmly. Since the fingers move radially inward they also provide a centering function. The flexible fingers <b>223</b> fit between the elastomeric collet <b>220</b> and the flanged outer sleeve <b>218</b> so that when the lower retainer <b>210</b> is mated with the center mold assembly <b>212</b>, the dosage form is tightly held in place and a seal is created around the dosage form. When an uncoated dosage form is being transferred to the lower retainer <b>210</b> or a partially coated dosage form is being transferred from the lower retainer <b>210</b> to the center mold assembly <b>212</b>, the center support stem <b>222</b> moves to an upward position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> and the flexible fingers <b>223</b> expand radially outward. Expansion of the flexible fingers <b>223</b> allows the elastomeric collet <b>220</b> to expand as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Radial expansion and contraction of the dosage form holder <b>217</b> can be accomplished by alternative means. For example the flexible fingers <b>223</b> can be replaced by rigid fingers that pivot on bearings and are actuated by cam followers. Alternatively linear bearings and plungers arranged in a radial fashion can move or collapse in the radial direction. Mechanisms similar to the shutter of a camera or inflatable bladders in the shape of an inner tube or torus can also provide similar actions and movements.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">An actuator assembly <b>225</b> that includes in a preferred embodiment a spring <b>228</b>, a plate <b>227</b>, a linear bearing <b>237</b> and a small cam follower <b>229</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> can be used to accomplish the vertical movement required to close or open the dosage form holder <b>217</b>. The plate <b>227</b> is mounted to the support stem <b>222</b> so that movement of the plate <b>227</b> in the vertical direction moves the support stem <b>222</b>. In a preferred embodiment, there is one plate <b>227</b> for every eight support stems <b>222</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The spring <b>228</b> biases the plate <b>227</b> and therefore the support stems <b>222</b> to an upward position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> in which the dosage form is not sealed within the dosage form holder <b>217</b>. During rotation of the rotor <b>202</b>, the small cam follower <b>229</b> rides in small cam track <b>215</b>, which causes the plate <b>227</b> to move down to seal the dosage form in the dosage form holders <b>217</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. After molding, the small cam follower <b>229</b> along with the spring <b>228</b> causes the plate <b>227</b> to move upward and release the dosage forms.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Because the flowable material is injected from above the dosage form, as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 37</figref>, the edge <b>226</b> of the elastomeric collet stops flow of the flowable material. Consequently, only the portion of the dosage form <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> that is above the elastomeric collet <b>220</b> will be coated when the lower retainer <b>210</b> and center mold assembly <b>210</b> are mated. This permits a first flowable material to be used to coat one part of the dosage form, and a second flowable material to coat the remainder of the dosage form—that portion which is beneath the elastomeric collet. Although the elastomeric collet is shaped so that about half of the dosage form will be coated at one time, the elastomeric collet can be of any desired shape to achieve a coating on only a certain portion of the dosage form.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">When two halves of a dosage form are coated with different flowable materials, the two flowable materials may be made to overlap, or if desired, not to overlap. With the present invention, very precise control of the interface between the two flowable materials on the dosage form is possible. Accordingly, the two flowable materials may be made flush with each other with substantially no overlap. Or the two flowable materials may be made with a variety of edges, for example to allow the edges of the flowable materials to interlock.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Any suitable controls including without limitation mechanical, electronic, hydraulic or pneumatic can be used to move the lower retainer. In a preferred embodiment the controls are mechanical and include a large cam follower <b>231</b>, large cam track <b>211</b> and actuator arm <b>235</b>. The large cam follower <b>231</b> rides in large cam track <b>211</b> and moves up and down within the large cam track. The actuator arm connects the large cam follower to the lower retainer so that movement of the large cam follower up and down causes the lower retainer to move up and down. Thus, as rotor <b>202</b> rotates the lower retainer <b>210</b> rotates with the rotor <b>202</b> and the large cam follower <b>231</b> moves along the large cam track <b>211</b>, which is stationary. When at a position to receive dosage forms, the lower retainer <b>210</b> is in a down position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 38</figref>. After dosage forms have been transferred to the lower retainer <b>210</b>, the support stems <b>220</b> move down due to actuation of cam follower <b>229</b> and actuator assembly <b>225</b> to seal the dosage forms in the lower retainer <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 39</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Following this, the large cam follower <b>231</b> causes the lower retainer <b>210</b> to move up and mate with the center mold assembly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. Once mated, the dosage form is partially coated in the center mold assembly <b>212</b>. Continued rotation of the rotor <b>202</b> causes the large cam follower <b>231</b> to move down in the large cam track <b>211</b>, which then causes the lower retainer <b>210</b> to lower and separate from the center mold assembly <b>212</b> back to the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 35</figref>. In addition, rotation of the rotor <b>202</b> also causes the actuator <b>225</b> to move the support stems <b>222</b> as described above. The support stem <b>222</b> moves to release the dosage forms just prior to or simultaneously with the lower retainer moving downward to separate from the center mold assembly <b>212</b>. Thus, the lower retainer functions to receive dosage forms, hold dosage forms while being partially coated in the center mold assembly <b>212</b>, and transfer dosage forms to the center mold assembly after they have been partially coated.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">2. The Center Mold Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The center mold assembly <b>212</b> is rotatably mounted to the rotor <b>202</b> on an axis that is radial to the rotor. That is, the axis of rotation of the center mold assembly is perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the rotor. The arrangement allows the center mold assembly to rotate 180 degrees (end for end) at a prescribed time while the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> is simultaneously revolving about its vertical axis. Preferably, the center mold assembly <b>212</b> is mounted so that it is capable of rotating 180 degrees in either direction. Alternatively, the center mold assembly can be mounted so that it rotates 180 degrees in a first direction and then rotates a further 180 degrees. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> depicts several center mold assemblies <b>212</b> in a plan view. All of the center mold assemblies <b>212</b> are similarly mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The center mold assembly comprises a series of back-to-back, identical insert assemblies <b>230</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32-35</figref>, <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. The center mold assembly <b>212</b> rotates partially coated dosage forms from their downwardly oriented positions to upwardly oriented positions. The upwardly pointing portions of the dosage forms, which have been coated with flowable material, can now receive the remainder of their coatings once the center mold assembly <b>212</b> mates with the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>. Also, the insert assemblies previously pointing upward now point downward. Thus they are now in a position to mate with the lower retainer <b>210</b> to receive uncoated dosage forms.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Rotation of the center mold assembly may be accomplished, for example, using the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>. Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> are cam follower carriage <b>215</b>, cam track ring <b>285</b> comprising an upper groove <b>283</b> and lower groove <b>281</b>, linkage <b>279</b>, shaft <b>213</b>, and rotor <b>202</b>. As shown, the linkage <b>279</b> is geared and shaft <b>213</b> has a geared portion, such that the shaft <b>213</b> will rotate as the linkage <b>279</b> moves up and down. The upper groove <b>283</b> and lower groove <b>281</b> of the cam track ring <b>285</b> are connected to each other by an “X” or crisscross pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>. This “X” pattern occurs at one location on the cam track ring. This allows the cam follower carriage <b>215</b> to follow the lower groove <b>281</b> during a first revolution (360 degrees) of the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b>. On a second revolution, the cam follower carriage <b>215</b> follows the upper groove <b>283</b>. After 720 degrees of rotation the cam follower carriage <b>215</b> switches back to the lower groove <b>281</b> and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The groove pattern shown moves the linkage <b>279</b> up and down during rotation of the rotor to control the rotation of the shaft <b>213</b> and therefore the center mold assembly <b>212</b>. Thus, as the cam follower carriage <b>215</b> moves down, the linkage <b>279</b> moves down and the shaft <b>213</b> and center mold assembly <b>212</b> rotate counter clockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>. Similarly, when the cam follower carriage <b>215</b> moves up, the linkage <b>279</b> moves up and drives the shaft <b>213</b> and center mold assembly <b>212</b> to rotate clockwise. Each center mold assembly <b>212</b> is similarly mounted to a cam follower carriage <b>215</b>, so that each center mold <b>212</b> will similarly rotate first 180 degrees clockwise at the point where the upper and lower grooves cross, and then upon another revolution of the rotor <b>202</b> the center molds rotate 180 degrees counterclockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The cam follower carriage <b>215</b> has a pivot point <b>215</b>D upon which it is mounted to the linkage <b>279</b>. Attached to the cam follower carriage <b>215</b> are three cam followers <b>215</b>A, <b>215</b>B, <b>215</b>C which ride in the groove of the cam track ring <b>285</b>. The use of three cam followers (<b>215</b>A, <b>215</b>B, <b>215</b>C,) assures that the cam follower carriage <b>215</b> follows the correct path across the “X” crossing point of the cam track ring <b>285</b>, because the gap at the crossing point is shorter than the distance between any two cam followers. Upon crossing of the gap two of the three cam followers remain engaged in the cam track, while the third follower crosses the unsupported region at the crossing point. The path takes the form of a flattened or folded figure eight. The lower groove <b>281</b> is the bottom loop of the figure eight and the upper groove <b>283</b> forms the top loop.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Flowable material is preferably heated and cooled in the center mold assembly as follows. Each center mold assembly <b>212</b> further includes a valve actuator assembly <b>232</b>, a dosage form transfer actuator assembly <b>241</b>, and a plurality of manifold plates <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-47</figref>. First manifold plates <b>234</b> and second manifold plates <b>236</b> house insert assembly <b>230</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 46</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Defined within the first manifold plate <b>234</b> is a continuous channel <b>238</b> that defines a coolant/heating flow path, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref>. Channel <b>238</b> traverses around the insert assembly <b>230</b>. In a preferred embodiment the coolant/heating fluid is water but any suitable heat transfer fluid may be employed. First manifold plate <b>234</b> may also have inlet and outlet ports <b>242</b> through which the coolant can flow through to the channels <b>238</b>. Ports <b>242</b> couple the coolant channels <b>238</b> to the heat transfer system described below. The first manifold plate <b>234</b> may be mounted by any suitable means in the center mold assembly <b>212</b>, one of which is by mechanical fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Preferably, hot fluid flows through the channels <b>238</b> to heat the center mold assemblies <b>212</b> just prior to and during the injection of the flowable material. Heating can begin prior to or after enclosing the dosage forms within the mold assemblies. Then, simultaneously with or after injection of the flowable material into the mold assemblies, the heat transfer fluid is preferably switched from hot to cold to solidify the flowable material.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The second manifold plate <b>236</b> comprises a plurality of holes <b>248</b> that are aligned with holes <b>240</b> in the respective first manifold plate <b>234</b>, so that an insert assembly <b>230</b> can be fixed within the holes <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>. The second manifold plate <b>236</b> also comprises channels <b>250</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>. The flowable material flows through the channels <b>250</b> to the insert assembly <b>230</b>, which directs the flowable material to the dosage forms. Flowable material connector ports <b>252</b> may also be included within the second manifold plate <b>236</b> that allow connection of tubing <b>208</b> to channels <b>250</b>. Thus, flowable material can be injected from the reservoir <b>206</b> through the tubing <b>208</b>, ports <b>252</b>, channels <b>250</b> and to the insert assembly <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 47</figref>, the second manifold plate <b>236</b> may optionally comprise a heating flow path <b>236</b>B to warm the insert assembly <b>230</b> and maintain the flowable material temperature above its melting point. Depending on the type of flowable material used, this heating may or may not be needed. For example, some flowable materials need to be relatively warm to exhibit good flow properties. Heating flow path <b>236</b>B circulates through the second manifold plate <b>236</b> and connects to ports <b>236</b>A. From the ports, tubing (not shown) can be used to connect the heating flow path <b>236</b>B to a heat exchanger that maintains the heating fluid warm. Preferably, the heating fluid is water.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Each insert assembly <b>230</b> preferably comprises a stationary part, which includes a center insert <b>254</b> , and a moveable part, which is in essence a nozzle and comprises a valve body <b>260</b>, a valve stem <b>280</b> and valve body tip <b>282</b>, as shown best in FIGS. <b>41</b> and <b>48</b>-<b>50</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48-50</figref> illustrate one nozzle or valve assembly, in a preferred embodiment there are preferably sixteen such nozzles or valve assemblies per center mold assembly <b>212</b>, eight facing the upper mold assembly and eight facing the lower retainer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> depicts the insert assembly <b>230</b> in its closed position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> shows the insert assembly <b>230</b> positioned for injection of flowable material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> illustrates the insert assembly <b>230</b> in the dosage form transfer position.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The center insert <b>254</b> may be mounted to the first manifold plate <b>234</b> by any suitable means, and is preferably sealed with o-rings <b>262</b> and grooves <b>264</b> to prevent leakage of flowable material, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. The coolant channels <b>238</b> are defined between the first manifold plate <b>234</b> and the center insert <b>254</b>. The center insert <b>254</b> is constructed from a material that has a relatively high thermal conductivity, such as stainless steel, aluminum, berylium-copper, copper, brass, or gold. This ensures that heat can be transferred from the heat transfer fluid through the center insert to the flowable material. Heating ensures that the flowable material will flow into the center mold insert upon injection, and cooling at least partially hardens the flowable material. Depending on the type of flowable material used, however, heating may not be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Each center insert <b>254</b> comprises a center cavity <b>266</b> within it, the surface of which defines the final shape of the dosage form. In a preferred embodiment, center cavity <b>266</b> covers about half of a dosage form and is designed such that when mated with the lower retainer <b>210</b> or upper mold assembly <b>214</b> the dosage form will be covered and sealed. Center cavities <b>266</b> can be appropriately shaped and sized based on the parameters of the dosage form. Moreover, the surface of the center cavities may be designed to form coatings having a variety of features, i.e., dimple patterns (similar to a golf ball), holes, symbols including letters and numbers, or other shapes and figures. Use of the center cavities described herein also permits precise control over the thickness of the molded coating. In particular, with the present thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b> coatings having thicknesses of about 0.003 to about 0.030 inches may be consistently obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In a preferred embodiment, an air passage <b>239</b> is also disposed through the first manifold plate <b>234</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>. Compressed air is fed through the air passage <b>239</b> and used to assist in ejection of the coated dosage form from the center mold assembly <b>212</b> to the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>. Although air is preferred for this purpose, the invention is not limited thereto. An alternative ejector means, such as an ejector pin, may be used. The air can be pressurized to a relatively small pressure and can be provided from air banks or the like that lead to a connection port in the first manifold plate <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The movable portion of the insert assembly <b>230</b> includes the valve body <b>260</b>, the valve stem <b>280</b>, and the valve body tip <b>282</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. The valve stem <b>280</b> is independently moveable. The valve stem <b>280</b> and valve body <b>260</b> are slidably mounted within the insert assembly <b>230</b>. In the preferred embodiment shown, a plurality of o-rings <b>284</b> and grooves <b>286</b> seal the moveable portions of the insert assembly to the stationary portion of the insert assembly. Disposed around the valve stem <b>280</b> and the valve body tip <b>282</b> is a flowable material path through which flowable material traveling through the second manifold plate <b>236</b> flows when the insert assembly is in the open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">Although the center mold assembly <b>212</b> is constructed with identical insert assemblies <b>230</b> on both sides of its rotary axis, each insert assembly <b>230</b> performs a different function depending on whether it is oriented in the up or in the down position. When facing down, the insert assemblies <b>230</b> are actuated to inject flowable material to coat a first portion of a dosage form. The insert assemblies <b>230</b> that are facing up are presenting partially coated dosage forms to the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>. During this time, the upward facing insert assemblies are in a neutral position. Prior to the molds opening however, the upward facing insert assemblies are actuated to allow compressed air to enter the center cavity <b>266</b>. This ejects the now completely coated dosage forms from the upward facing insert assemblies. Thus the completed dosage forms remain seated or held in the upper mold assembly <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Advantageously, the center mold assembly is designed to be actuated with just one valve actuator assembly <b>232</b> and just one air actuator assembly <b>241</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>). The valve actuator assembly <b>232</b> only actuates the insert assemblies <b>230</b> that are facing down, while the air actuator assembly <b>241</b> actuates only those insert assemblies <b>230</b> facing up.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Downward facing valve stem <b>280</b> is spring loaded to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> by spring <b>290</b>. Downward facing valve stem <b>280</b> is moveable between the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> and the open position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> by valve actuator assembly <b>232</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. In the preferred embodiment shown, the valve actuator assembly <b>232</b> comprises an actuator plate <b>292</b> and cam follower <b>294</b> mounted thereto. Spring <b>290</b> is mounted within the valve stem <b>280</b> to spring load the valve stem <b>280</b> to the closed position. An end of the valve stem <b>280</b> is mounted within the actuator plate <b>292</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, so that the valve stem will move with the actuator plate <b>292</b>. Actuator plate <b>292</b> is mounted to move up and down as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. Cam follower <b>294</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 41</figref>. It rides in the cam track <b>274</b> disposed around the rotor <b>202</b>. Cam follower <b>294</b> moves up and down according to the profile of cam track <b>274</b> to move the actuator plate <b>292</b> and thereby control movement of the downward facing valve stem <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Actuator plate <b>292</b> moves upward and opens the downward facing insert assemblies as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> by moving and pulling the downward facing valve stems <b>280</b> against the bias of spring <b>290</b> from the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. Opening of the downward facing valve stems ports flowable material to dosage forms disposed between the center mold assembly <b>212</b> and the lower retainer <b>210</b>. Following this, cam follower <b>294</b> and actuator plate <b>292</b> move down to release the downward facing valve stems <b>280</b>. Due to the bias of spring <b>290</b>, the downward facing valve stems <b>280</b> move to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> to stop the flow of flowable material.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">When actuator plate <b>292</b> moves up as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the upward facing insert assemblies <b>230</b> remain stationary and closed.

Dosage forms in the upward facing insert assemblies are coated by the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>, described below. Similarly, no air is provided to the downward facing insert assemblies because dosage forms are only released from the upward facing insert assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">After the flowable material has been ported and the downward facing insert assemblies <b>230</b> return to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, cam followers <b>246</b>A and <b>246</b>B and air actuator plate <b>277</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>) initiate movement of the valve body tip <b>282</b> and valve stem <b>280</b> of the upward facing insert assemblies <b>230</b>. This provides a path for air through the center mold insert. In particular, the upward facing valve body tip <b>282</b> and valve stem <b>280</b> move from the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> due to movement of cam followers <b>246</b>A and <b>246</b>B downward as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>.

In this position, the upward facing valve stem <b>280</b> and valve body tip <b>282</b> are withdrawn. The upward facing valve stem <b>280</b> rests against the upward facing valve body tip <b>282</b> to stop the flow of flowable material. With the valve body tip <b>282</b> withdrawn, however, air from can flow to the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">After the dosage forms have been transferred from the center mold assembly, the air actuator plate <b>277</b> returns up to release the upward facing valve body <b>260</b>, valve body tip <b>282</b> and valve stem <b>280</b> to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">3. The Upper Mold Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The upper mold assembly <b>214</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51-54</figref>, is similar in construction to half of the center mold assembly <b>212</b>. Like the center mold assembly <b>212</b>, the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> directs flowable material to at least partially coat a dosage form. In particular, the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> has a plurality of upper insert assemblies <b>296</b> (eight in the preferred embodiment) that mate with corresponding insert assemblies <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Although the upper mold assembly is similar to the center mold assembly, the upper mold assembly does not rotate. Rather, the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> moves vertically up and down to mate with the center mold assembly via suitable controls as best understood by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32-35</figref>. Preferably, cam follower <b>299</b>, cam track <b>298</b>, and connector arm <b>293</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) are used to control the movement of the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>. Small cam follower <b>289</b> and small cam track <b>288</b> control upper actuator plate <b>291</b>. Cam follower <b>299</b>, cam track <b>298</b>, small cam follower <b>289</b>, and small cam track <b>288</b> are similar in construction to the corresponding elements of the lower retainer <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The upper mold assembly <b>214</b> moves during rotation of the rotor <b>202</b> via cam follower <b>299</b> to mate with the center mold assembly <b>212</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32-35</figref> and at least partially coat a dosage form. After this, the cam follower <b>299</b> separates the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> from the center mold assembly <b>212</b> so that the finished, fully coated dosage form can be ejected and transferred from the thermal cycle molding module as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The upper mold assembly <b>214</b> comprises an upper second manifold plate <b>251</b> that ports flowable material to upper insert assemblies <b>296</b> and is similar in construction to the second manifold plate <b>236</b> of the center mold assembly <b>212</b>. An upper first manifold plate <b>253</b> provides cooling/heating to the upper insert assemblies <b>296</b> and is similar in construction to the first manifold plate <b>234</b> of the center mold assembly <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">A seal around each dosage form is preferably created by contact between the upward facing insert assembly <b>230</b> of the center mold assembly <b>212</b> and the upper insert assembly <b>296</b> of the upper mold assembly <b>214</b>, as best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48-50</figref>. An upper insert assembly <b>296</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-54</figref> in the closed, open and eject positions, respectively. Similar to the insert assemblies <b>230</b>, each upper insert assembly <b>296</b> includes a stationary portion that includes an upper insert <b>265</b> and a upper flanged insert <b>258</b> and a moveable portion that is basically a nozzle. The latter comprises an upper valve body <b>273</b>, upper valve stem <b>297</b> and upper valve body tip <b>295</b>. The upper valve stem <b>297</b> is moveable between open and closed positions to control flow of the flowable material to the dosage form. The upper valve body, upper valve stem and upper valve body tip define the flow path for the flowable material.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Each upper cavity <b>272</b> is appropriately sized so that the flowable material can flow over the dosage form and provide a coating of the desired thickness. Similar to the center cavity <b>266</b> of the center insert <b>254</b>, the upper cavity <b>272</b> of the upper insert <b>265</b> can be of any desired shape and size or be provided with a surface pattern (such as dimples, letters, numbers, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">One difference between the upper insert assembly <b>296</b> and the insert assembly <b>230</b> is that the upper valve body tip <b>295</b> forms part of the seal around the dosage form as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-54</figref> and moves outward rather than inward to eject a dosage form after it has been fully coated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> depicts the upper valve body tip <b>295</b> positioned to eject a dosage form. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> depicts the upper valve body tip <b>295</b> positioned to receive a dosage form.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">An upper valve actuator <b>275</b> that includes an upper actuator plate <b>291</b>, linkage <b>291</b>B and cam follower <b>289</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> actuate the upper insert assembly <b>296</b>. In other embodiments, electronic or other mechanical controls can be used. The linkage <b>291</b> B couples cam follower <b>289</b> to the upper actuator plate <b>291</b>. The upper actuator plate <b>291</b> has a portion <b>291</b>D that extends beneath a plunger so that when the upper actuator plate <b>291</b> moves up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>) it pulls on valve stem <b>297</b>. Upper actuator plate <b>291</b> also rests on top of upper valve stem <b>297</b> so that when the upper actuator plate <b>291</b> moves down, the plunger and the upper valve stem <b>297</b> are pushed down (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">As the rotor <b>202</b> rotates, cam follower <b>289</b>, riding in cam track <b>298</b>, moves up, causing the upper actuator plate <b>291</b> to rise and pull upper valve stem <b>297</b> against the bias of spring <b>269</b> and hence move it from the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> to the open position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>. After this, cam follower <b>289</b> moves down and causes upper actuator plate <b>291</b> to move upper valve stem <b>297</b> to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Next, cam follower <b>289</b> moves down and causes upper actuator plate <b>291</b> to move further down. When upper actuator plate <b>291</b> moves down, it depresses upper valve stem <b>297</b>, which pushes upper valve body <b>273</b> and upper valve body tip <b>295</b> against the bias of spring <b>271</b>. Upper valve body tip <b>295</b> thus assumes the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> to eject a dosage form. In addition, as upper valve body tip <b>295</b> moves down air is ported around it from the compressed air path <b>267</b>. As with the center mold assembly, compressed air in the upper mold assembly ensures that the coated dosage form does not stick to the upper insert <b>265</b> when it is ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">After the coated dosage form is ejected, it may be sent to a transfer device, dryer, or other mechanism. Following this, cam follower <b>289</b> and upper actuator plate <b>291</b> move back up. This in turn moves upper valve stem <b>297</b> and upper valve body tip <b>295</b> back to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> due to the bias of spring <b>271</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Similar to the center mold assembly, heated heat transfer fluid is directed through the upper first manifold plate <b>253</b> and upper insert assembly <b>296</b> to heat them during injection of the flowable material. Chilled heat transfer fluid is directed through the upper first manifold plate <b>253</b> and upper insert assembly <b>296</b> after the flowable material has been injected to harden it. In addition, warm heat transfer fluid can be sent through the upper second manifold plate <b>251</b> constantly to heat the flowable material above its melting point.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">4. Temperature Control and Energy Recovery System</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Preferably, the center and upper mold assemblies <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> of the thermal cycle molding module are hot, i.e., above the melting point of the flowable material, when the flowable material is injected into them. This assists the flowable material in flowing. The mold assemblies are then preferably cooled, i.e., to below the melting or setting temperature of the flowable material, rather quickly to harden the flowable material.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In light of this cycle, a heat sink, a heat source and a temperature control system are preferably provided to change the temperature of the molds. Examples of heat sinks include but are not limited to chilled air, Ranque Effect cooling, and Peltier effect devices. Examples of heat sources include electric heaters, steam, forced hot air, Joule Thomson effect, ranque effect, ultrasonic, and microwave heating. In a preferred embodiment, a heat transfer fluid such as water or oil is used to transfer heat, while electric immersion heaters provide the heat source for the heat transfer fluid. Preferably, electrically powered freon chillers provide the heat sink for the heat transfer fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55 and 56</figref> depict the preferred temperature control system <b>600</b> for the center mold assemblies and upper mold assemblies. Although only one mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b> is depicted, all mold assemblies are connected to the temperature control system in a similar fashion. Preferably, the temperature control system <b>600</b> includes a tubing system <b>606</b> and valves <b>620</b> to <b>623</b>. Tubing system <b>606</b> includes a cold loop <b>608</b> for cooling mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>, and a hot loop <b>609</b> for heating them. Both loops share a common flow passageway between “T” fitting <b>603</b> and “T” fitting <b>605</b>. Defined within the common flow passageway between “T” fitting <b>603</b> and “T” fitting <b>605</b> is a flow path in the mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>. Valves <b>620</b> to <b>623</b>, which may be solenoid or mechanically operated, control the flow of cool or heated heat transfer fluid through the mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>. The system may also include a heater <b>610</b>, which heats the hot loop, and a chiller <b>612</b>, which provides a chilled fluid source for the cold loop. Outlet ports <b>612</b>A and inlet ports <b>612</b>B of the chiller and outlet ports <b>610</b>A and inlet ports <b>610</b>B of the heater can be connected to multiple molds, so that a single chiller and a single heater can support all of the upper molds <b>214</b> and center molds <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Valves <b>620</b> to <b>623</b> are initially in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>. Valves <b>621</b> and <b>623</b> of the hot loop <b>609</b> are open so that hot heat transfer fluid can flow and circulate through the mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>. In contrast, the valves of the cold loop <b>620</b> and <b>622</b> are closed so that coolant cannot flow through that loop. After flowable material has been injected into the hot mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>, the cycle is switched to the cooling mode by closing solenoid valves <b>620</b> and <b>622</b> of the hot loop and opening valves <b>603</b> and <b>605</b> of the cold loop <b>608</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>). This blocks the flow of hot heat transfer fluid to the molds assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>, and starts the flow of chilled heat transfer fluid therethrough. Preferably, the center mold assembly <b>212</b> and the upper mold assembly <b>214</b> are capable of cycling in the temperature range of about 0 to about 100° C. in about 1 seconds to 30 seconds. In the preferred embodiment using gelatin at 60% moisture content, the center and upper mold assemblies <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> cycle between about 35° C. and 20° C. in about 2 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">The cold and hot heat transfer fluid thus flows in the common flow passageway between “T” fittings <b>603</b> and <b>605</b>. When the valves switch from the heating mode to the cooling mode, the volume of hot heat transfer fluid enclosed within the common flow passageway is transferred to the cold side of the system. Conversely, hot heat transfer fluid trapped in the common flow passageway is transferred into the cold loop when the valves switch to the heating mode.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Although the volume of fluid in the common flow passageway is relatively small, and the cost of energy to heat and chill this volume of fluid is not unreasonable for a commercial process, a more preferred, energy efficient, and cost effective temperature control system is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57-59</figref>. This preferred temperature control system <b>600</b> includes the following components additional to those described above: a fluid reservoir <b>630</b>, a moveable piston <b>604</b> bisecting the fluid reservoir, and valves <b>626</b> and <b>627</b>. The fluid reservoir can be replaced with two collapsible bladders (hot and cold), thus eliminating the need for the piston <b>604</b>. For ease of description, however, the reservoir and piston embodiment is described herein. Valves <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>,<b>622</b>,<b>623</b>,<b>626</b> and <b>627</b>, which may be solenoid or mechanically operated, control the flow of cool or hot heat transfer fluid through the system. Each mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b> has its own fluid reservoir <b>630</b>, piston <b>604</b>, and valves <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>,<b>622</b>,<b>623</b>,<b>626</b> and <b>627</b>. Initially, the valves are in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>. Valves <b>620</b>, <b>622</b>, and <b>626</b> of the cold loop are open so that cool heat transfer fluid can flow to the mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>. In contrast, the valves of the hot loop <b>621</b>, <b>623</b>,<b>627</b> are closed so that hot heat transfer fluid cannot flow through that loop. The piston <b>604</b> is forced to the cold loop side by the position of the valves <b>626</b>,<b>622</b>,<b>623</b>, and <b>627</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">When the system switches to heating mode the solenoid valves, which are controlled by an electronic signal or by mechanical (cam) actuation, close or open as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>. Valves <b>620</b>, <b>626</b>, and <b>623</b> close and valves <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, and <b>627</b> open. This blocks the flow of cool heat transfer fluid from the cold loop to the mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b> and starts the flow of hot heat transfer fluid through the mold assembly <b>214</b>/<b>212</b>. This permits the hot heat transfer fluid to shift piston <b>604</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>. When piston <b>604</b> is in the far right position it is generally configured to contain a volume of liquid equal to fluid enclosed within the passageway between “T” fittings <b>603</b> and <b>605</b>. This volume is tunable by adjusting when the valves open and close, or by adjusting the volume of the fluid reservoir <b>630</b>. When piston <b>604</b> reaches its preselected rightmost position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>) valves <b>622</b>, <b>626</b>, and <b>620</b> close and valves <b>621</b>, <b>623</b>, and <b>627</b> open. The fluid contained in the fluid reservoir to the left of piston <b>604</b> is cold. Fluid to the right of piston <b>604</b> is hot and most of this hot fluid has been evacuated from the cylinder. The heating mode of the system is now in progress in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>. When the system switches to cooling mode, piston <b>604</b> moves in the opposite direction (to the left) and fills with hot fluid thus reversing the process just described. By preventing or minimizing hot heat transfer fluid from entering the chilled side and by preventing cold heat transfer fluid from entering the hot side, energy losses are minimized and the system is maximally efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60-62</figref> depict a particularly preferred embodiment of the temperature control system incorporating an automatic valve system <b>650</b>. The automatic valve system <b>650</b> directs heat transfer fluid to energy recovery bladders <b>651</b> and <b>652</b>. The automatic valve system <b>650</b> replaces valves <b>622</b> and <b>623</b> of the system described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57-59</figref>. Connecting energy recovery bladders together is connection rod <b>653</b>. Slidably mounted to the connection rod <b>653</b> is valve slide <b>654</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Operation of the automatic valve system <b>650</b> is best understood by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60 through 62</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> cold heat transfer fluid is circulating and hot heat transfer fluid is not. The energy recovery bladders are shifted to the right most position with hot heat transfer fluid filling bladder <b>652</b>. Valve slide <b>654</b> is seated in its right most position by a flanged portion <b>653</b>A of connection rod <b>653</b> allowing fluid to pass to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, the temperature control system has just switched from cooling mode to heating mode by switching valves <b>620</b> and <b>626</b> from their open to closed positions. Valves <b>621</b> and <b>627</b> have switched from closed to open positions, allowing hot heat transfer fluid to begin flowing around loop <b>609</b>. The pressure from the fluid in loop <b>609</b> forces energy recovery bladder <b>651</b> to fill and move to the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>. Simultaneously, energy recovery bladder <b>652</b> empties and moves to left due to the linking of the bladders by connection rod <b>653</b>. The valve slide <b>654</b> functions as a check valve and remains seated to the right due to pressure against its left face. As bladders <b>651</b> and <b>652</b> continue to move to the left, flanged portion <b>653</b>B of connection rod <b>653</b> makes contact with the right face of valve slide <b>654</b>, unseating it and shifting it to the left most position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>. The temperature control system is now in the heating mode. When the temperature control system switches back from heating to cooling mode the cycle repeats and the bladders <b>651</b> and <b>652</b> move to the right.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">As described above, valves <b>620</b> through <b>623</b> of the temperature control system can be of various designs known in art, such as spool, plug, ball, or pinch valves. These valves can be actuated by suitable means such as air, electrical solenoids, or by mechanical means such as cam tracks and cam followers. In a preferred embodiment, the valves are pinch valves and are actuated by mechanical cam tracks and cam followers as the thermal cycle molding module rotates. Known pinch valves are relatively simple devices comprising a flexible section of tubing and a mechanism that produces a pinching or squeezing action on the tubing. This tubing is compressed or “pinched” to block fluid flow therethrough. Release of the tubing allows fluid to flow. Accordingly, the pinch valve functions as a two-way valve.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">The pinch valves of the present temperature control system utilize a rotary design to “pinch” and “unpinch” flexible tubing. As described above, the center mold assembly rotates clockwise and then counterclockwise over an arc of 180 degrees. Feeding the center mold assembly are eight tubes <b>606</b> that supply heat transfer fluid (two supply and two return lines for each mold assembly). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 63-65</figref> depict a rotary pinch valve assembly <b>660</b> of the invention. The rotary pinch valve assembly <b>660</b> comprises a valve anvil <b>661</b> fixed to shaft <b>662</b>. Shaft <b>662</b> is attached to center mold assembly <b>212</b> (not shown) so that it can rotate about the same axis. Rotatably mounted to shaft <b>662</b> is valve pinch arm <b>663</b>A. A similar valve pinch arm <b>663</b>B is also rotatably mounted to shaft <b>662</b> and is free to move independently of valve pinch arm <b>663</b>A. Actuating the valve pinch arms are valve actuators <b>665</b>A and <b>665</b>B, which move cam follows <b>666</b>A and <b>666</b>B in the vertical direction. The vertical rise and fall of actuators <b>665</b>A and <b>665</b>B causes corresponding movements of cam followers <b>666</b>A and <b>666</b>B, which imparts a rotational movement to valve pinch arms <b>663</b>A and <b>663</b>B via gears <b>667</b>A and <b>667</b>B, which are rotatably mounted to valve anvil <b>661</b>. Gears <b>667</b>A and <b>667</b>B reduce or amplify the rotational movement of the valve pinch arms <b>663</b>A and <b>663</b>B by an amount proportional to the gear ratio. Although gears <b>667</b>A and <b>667</b>B are used in the preferred embodiment described here, in other embodiments they can be dispensed with. Rotational movement of the valve pinch arms can be imparted directly by cam followers and actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The counter clockwise rotation of valve pinch arms <b>663</b>A and <b>663</b>B about shaft <b>661</b> causes tubes <b>606</b>B to be squeezed closed and tubes <b>606</b>A to remain open. Conversely, clockwise rotation of valve pinch arms <b>663</b>A and <b>663</b>B about shaft <b>661</b> causes tubes <b>606</b>A to be squeezed closed and tubes <b>606</b>B to remain open. The position of the valves (open or closed) depends on whether the orientation of center mold assembly <b>212</b> is up or down. It is also a requirement that the position of the valves remain unchanged (or controlled) as the center mold assembly makes its 180 degree rotation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, the circular cam track <b>669</b> allows cam followers <b>666</b>A and <b>666</b>B to remain in their fully actuated positions while the rotary pinch valve assembly <b>660</b> rotates clockwise and counter clockwise 180 degrees. Cam followers <b>666</b>A and <b>666</b>B can transit either the inner surface or outer surface of the circular cam track <b>669</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>.</p>

<p id="h-0014" num="0000">1. Structure of the Transfer Device</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Known tablet presses use a simple stationary “take-off” bar to remove and eject tablets from the machine. Since the turrets of these machines rotate at fairly high speeds (up to 120 rpm), the impact forces on the tablets as they hit the stationary take-off bar are very significant. Dosage forms produced on these machines must therefore be formulated to possess very high mechanical strength and have very low friability just to survive the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">In contrast with prior art devices, the present transfer device is capable of handling dosage forms having a higher degree of friability, preferably containing little or no conventional binders. Thus, a preferred formulation for use with present invention comprises one or more medicants, disintegrants, and fillers, but is substantially free of binders. Dosage forms having a very high degree of softness and fragility may be transferred from any one of the operating modules of the invention as a finished product using the transfer device, or transferred from one operating module to another for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The present transfer device is a rotating device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 68</figref>. It comprises a plurality of transfer units <b>304</b>. It is preferably used for transferring dosage forms or inserts within a continuous process of the invention comprising one or more operating modules, i.e., from one operating module to another. For example, dosage forms may be transferred from a compression module <b>100</b> to a thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b>, or from a thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> to a compression module <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the transfer device can be used to transfer dosage forms or other medicinal or non-medicinal products between the devices used to make such products, or to discharge fragile products from such machines.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Transfer devices <b>300</b> and <b>700</b> are substantially identical in construction. For convenience, transfer device <b>300</b> will be described in detail below. Each of the transfer units <b>304</b> are coupled to a flexible conveying means, shown here as a belt <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68 and 69</figref>), which may be made of any suitable material, one example of which is a composite consisting of a polyurethane toothed belt with reinforcing cords of polyester or poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide (Kevlar®, E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Del.). The belt runs around the inner periphery of the device <b>300</b>. The transfer units <b>304</b> are attached to the belt <b>312</b> as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The transfer device can take any of a variety of suitable shapes. However, when used to transfer dosage forms or inserts between operating modules of the present invention, transfer device is preferably generally dog bone shaped so that it can accurately conform to the pitch radii of two circular modules, enabling a precision transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The transfer device can be driven to rotate by any suitable power source such as an electric motor. In a preferred embodiment, the transfer device is linked to operating modules of the invention and is driven by mechanical means through a gearbox which is connected to the main drive motor <b>50</b>. In this configuration the velocity and positions of the individual transfer units of the transfer device can be synchronized with the operating modules. In a preferred embodiment the drive train includes a drive pulley <b>309</b> and an idler pulley <b>311</b> which are in the preferred embodiment disposed inside of the transfer device <b>300</b>. The drive shaft <b>307</b> connects the main drive train of the overall linked system to the drive pulley <b>309</b> of the transfer device. The drive shaft <b>307</b> drives the drive pulley <b>309</b> to rotate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 and 68</figref>. The drive pulley <b>309</b> has teeth <b>309</b>A that engage teeth <b>308</b> disposed on the interior of belt <b>312</b>, which in turn rotates the transfer device. The idler pulley <b>311</b> has teeth <b>311</b>A that engage belt <b>312</b>, which causes the idler to rotate with the belt <b>312</b>. Other flexible drive systems, such as chains, linked belts, metal belts, and the like can be used to convey the transfer units <b>304</b> of the transfer device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68 and 69</figref>, attached to the outer periphery of the transfer device <b>300</b> is a dog bone shaped cam track <b>310</b> which precisely determines the path for the belt and the transfer units. The radii of the cam track <b>310</b>, the pitch distance between the transfer units <b>304</b>, the pitch of the toothed belt <b>312</b>, and the gear ratio between the drive pulley <b>309</b> and the main drive of the linked system are all selected such that the transfer device is precisely aligned with the operating modules linked to it. As each operating module rotates, the transfer device remains synchronized and phased with each, such that a precise and controlled transfer from one operating module to another is achieved. The velocity and position of the transfer unit <b>304</b> is matched to the velocity and position of the operating module along the concave portions of the cam track. Transfers are accomplished along this arc length. The longer the length of the arc, the greater the time available to complete a transfer. Riding in cam track <b>310</b> are cam followers <b>305</b> suitably mounted to the transfer units (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">In a preferred embodiment of this invention, both the drive pulley <b>309</b> and the idler pulley <b>311</b> are driven. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68 and 69</figref> depict a toothed pulley <b>350</b>, a second toothed pulley <b>351</b> and a toothed belt <b>352</b>. Pulleys <b>350</b>, <b>351</b> and belt <b>352</b> connect the rotation of the drive pulley <b>309</b> with the rotation of the idler pulley <b>311</b>. This advantageously eliminates any slack side condition in the belt. Linking of pulleys <b>309</b> and <b>311</b> could also be accomplished using gears, gear boxes, line shafts, chains and sprockets or by synchronized electric motors.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">A preferred transfer unit <b>304</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 70-75</figref>, and generally includes a pair of plunger shafts <b>320</b>, one or preferably more than one cam follower <b>322</b>, a plurality of bearings <b>324</b> to retain the plunger shafts <b>320</b>, a spring <b>326</b>, a plate <b>328</b> that secures the plunger shafts <b>320</b> to cam follower <b>322</b> thereby controlling their movement, and a retainer <b>330</b>. Preferably, each transfer unit <b>304</b> is attached to flexible conveying means <b>312</b> in a cantilever configuration so that retainers <b>330</b> are cantilevered over the path of the dosage forms. This allows for multiple rows of retainers in the transfer unit and keeps contamination by dirty mechanical parts away from the dosage form and its sub components. Moreover, it allows the flexible conveying means to contact closely the operating modules to which it is connected, thereby allowing for a smooth transfer pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Retainers <b>330</b> are preferably flexible and constructed from an elastomeric material so that when no dosage form is inserted into the retainer <b>330</b>, the retainer <b>330</b> generally points radially inward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>. When a dosage form is pushed into the retainer <b>330</b>, the retainer <b>330</b> flexes upward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>. The dosage form passes the retainer <b>330</b> and releases it so that the retainer supports the dosage form in the transfer unit from below. A dosage form is ejected from a transfer unit by pushing down on the dosage form, thereby flexing the retainer and permitting the dosage form to be pushed out. Once released, the retainer <b>330</b> flexes back to its radially inward position so that it can receive another dosage form. In a preferred embodiment, the retainer <b>330</b> is circular and includes segmented fingers of elastomeric material as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, but it need not be so constructed. It need only be flexible enough to flex, hold the dosage form, and release the dosage form. Retainer <b>330</b> extends radially inward a distance such that when the dosage form is pushed past it, it holds the dosage form in place until it is ejected by the plunger shafts <b>320</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Cam follower <b>322</b> is disposed towards the top of the transfer unit <b>304</b>. It is mounted so that it can move up and down as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 70-74</figref>. Plate <b>328</b> is coupled to cam follower <b>322</b>. Spring <b>326</b> is connected to transfer unit <b>304</b> and biases the plate <b>328</b> and cam follower <b>322</b> to an upper position. Plate <b>328</b> is also coupled to each plunger shaft <b>320</b>, so that movement of the plate <b>328</b> will cause movement of the plunger shafts <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Each plunger shaft <b>320</b> is mounted within the transfer unit <b>304</b> by a plurality of bearings <b>324</b> that permit vertical movement of the plunger shafts <b>320</b>. The plunger shafts <b>320</b> are mounted so that one end of each plunger shaft <b>320</b> can move into the respective space in which a dosage form is retained to eject it from the retainer <b>330</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>. As described below, the plunger shafts <b>320</b> move in response to movement of the plate <b>328</b> and the roller bearing <b>322</b> to eject dosage forms from the transfer unit <b>304</b>. The plunger shafts <b>320</b> and bearings <b>324</b> may be made of any suitable material.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">2. Operation of the Transfer Device</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Operation of the transfer device is best understood with reference to FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>70</b>-<b>75</b>. A description of the operation of one transfer unit <b>304</b> is provided, but it will be understood that the other transfer units <b>304</b> operate in a similar fashion. Moreover, operation is described with respect to transfer of a dosage form from a compression module to a thermal cycle molding module, however, as stated above, transfer may be accomplished between any two operating modules or other devices. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> depicts a transfer device <b>700</b> transferring an insert from a thermal setting mold module to a compression module. The sole differences between transfer devices <b>300</b> and <b>700</b> are the geometry of the transferred object and the geometry of the transfer unit holders.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The transfer device operates as follows. The transfer unit <b>304</b> passes by the die table <b>114</b> of the compression module <b>100</b> and the two retainers <b>330</b> of the transfer unit <b>304</b> become aligned with die cavities <b>132</b> that are on a radial line, as shown on the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>. At the point of alignment, lower punch <b>120</b> moves upward in unison with plunger shafts <b>320</b> due to the cam tracks as described above. A dosage form <b>12</b> is ejected into the retainers <b>330</b> of the transfer unit <b>304</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 72</figref>, <b>73</b> and <b>75</b>. The dosage form flexes the retainer <b>330</b> until it moves past the retainer <b>330</b> and is held in the transfer unit <b>304</b> by the retainer <b>330</b>. Since the plunger shafts and lower punches capture the dosage form in a confined space with minimal clearance, the dosage form can not rotate or move randomly, which could jam this or subsequent apparatus. The dosage form is therefore fully controlled before, during, and after transfer. Rotation of the transfer device <b>300</b> and die table <b>114</b> of the compression module <b>100</b> are synchronized so that transfer units <b>304</b> will continually pass above the die cavities <b>132</b> and dosage forms will be continuously transferred to the transfer units <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">Further rotation of the transfer device <b>300</b> by the drive pulley causes the belt <b>312</b> and its attached transfer units <b>304</b> to rotate. Eventually, the transfer units <b>304</b> containing the dosage forms reach the lower retainer <b>210</b> of the thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 and 75</figref>. Cam <b>310</b> is disposed between the center mold assembly <b>212</b> and the lower retainer <b>210</b>. The lower retainer <b>210</b> passes just beneath the transfer units <b>304</b>. Thus, the transfer units <b>304</b> become aligned with two of the elastomeric collets <b>220</b> in the lower retainer. As the transfer unit <b>304</b> moves along cam track <b>310</b>, cam track <b>310</b> pushes on the cam follower <b>322</b>, which pushes on plate <b>328</b>. Plate <b>328</b> moves the plunger shafts <b>320</b>, which in turn move down and contact the dosage forms. This contact pushes the dosage forms past the elastomeric collets, and the dosage forms move out and into the elastomeric collets <b>220</b>. Lower retainer <b>210</b> and the transfer device <b>300</b> are rotating at speeds that permit the dosage forms to be continuously transferred from the transfer units <b>304</b> to the lower retainers <b>210</b>. As the retainers <b>330</b> move past the thermal cycle molding module, plunger shafts <b>320</b> return to their original upward position.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">3. Rotational Transfer Device</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">In a preferred alternate embodiment of this invention, a rotational transfer device is employed. Such a device is useful for handling dosage forms that must be both transferred from one piece of equipment and reoriented, for instance from a horizontal position to a vertical position, or vice versa. For example, two color gelcaps, elongated dosage forms in which the boundary between colors lies along the short axis of the dosage form (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>), must be compressed horizontally along their long axis, but coated in a vertical position. Accordingly, gelcaps compressed in the present compression module <b>100</b> and coated the thermal molding module <b>200</b> must be both transferred from the compression module and reoriented into a vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77-81</figref> depict a preferred rotational transfer device <b>600</b>, which is similar in construction to the transfer devices <b>300</b> and <b>700</b>. Like transfer devices <b>300</b> and <b>700</b> the rotational transfer device <b>600</b> is a rotating device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77 and 79</figref>. It comprises a plurality of rotatable transfer units <b>602</b> coupled to a toothed belt <b>604</b>. Riding in the shaped cam track <b>606</b> are cam followers <b>607</b> suitably mounted to the transfer units <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Each transfer unit <b>602</b> consists of a dosage form holder <b>608</b> rotatably mounted in a housing. Connected to the housing is a shaft <b>616</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref>). Ejector pin assembly <b>612</b> slides on bearings <b>614</b> along shaft <b>616</b> and its vertical movement is controlled by cam follower <b>618</b> and cam track <b>620</b>. Within the housing is gear <b>622</b>, which is attached to the shaft of the dosage form holder <b>608</b> and gear <b>623</b> which is attached to the shaft of the actuator arm <b>624</b>. Attached to actuator arm <b>624</b> is cam follower <b>626</b> which rides in cam track <b>628</b>. The vertical rise and fall of cam track <b>628</b> causes a corresponding movement of cam follower <b>626</b> which imparts a rotational movement to actuator arm <b>624</b>. As the actuator arm rotates, gears <b>622</b> and <b>623</b> amplify this rotation causing dosage form holder <b>608</b> to rotate by an amount proportional to the gear ratio. The gear arrangement and offset design of the actuator arm keep the transfer units symmetrical about the vertical axis between cam followers <b>607</b>. This symmetry of construction is required to assure proper tracking of cam followers <b>618</b> and <b>626</b> and dosage form holder <b>608</b> as they transit through the various concave and convex radii of the rotational transfer device <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">One sequence of operations of the rotational transfer device <b>600</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 79-81</figref>. Elongated dosage forms (caplet <b>690</b>) are compressed horizontally in the compression module <b>100</b> and are transferred through flexible retainers <b>630</b> into the dosage form holder <b>608</b>, which is also in a horizontal orientation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81A</figref>, <b>81</b>B, and <b>81</b>E). Upon further transit through shaped cam track <b>606</b> the dosage form holder <b>608</b> rotates 90 degrees to a vertical orientation due to motion of cam follower <b>626</b> within cam track <b>628</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 81C and 81F</figref>). Upon reaching lower retainer <b>210</b> of thermal cycle molding module <b>200</b>, caplet <b>690</b> is transferred through a second flexible retainer <b>630</b>B via the vertical movement of ejector pin assembly <b>612</b>. Ejector pin assembly <b>612</b> enters through holes <b>608</b>A in dosage form holder <b>608</b> to evacuate the chamber <b>680</b> that holds caplet <b>690</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81C</figref> and F and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 81D</figref> and G). Caplet <b>690</b> is now transferred to the lower retainer <b>210</b> and upon further transit through the shaped cam track <b>606</b>, the dosage form holder <b>608</b> rotates 90 degrees , returning to its horizontal position to begin the cycle over again (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Hardening Apparatus</heading>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Dosage forms that have been coated with flowable material in the thermal cycle molding module are relatively hard compared with dosage forms that have coated using conventional dipping processes. Thus, the amount of drying needed after molding a coating onto a dosage form using the thermal cycle molding module is substantially less than that required with known dipping processes. Nevertheless, they may still require hardening, depending upon the nature of the flowable material.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Preferably, dosage forms coated in the thermal cycle molding module are relatively hard so that they can be tumble hardened relatively quickly. Alternatively, an air dryer may be used. Any suitable dryers may be used. A variety are generally understood in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Thermal Setting Molding Module</heading>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">The thermal setting molding module may be used to make dosage forms per se, coatings, inserts for dosage forms, and the like from a starting material in flowable form. The thermal setting molding module may be used as part of the overall system <b>20</b> of the invention (i.e., linked to other modules) or as a stand alone unit.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> is a rotary apparatus comprising multiple hot injection nozzles and cold molding chambers. Each molding chamber has its own nozzle. Advantageously, the volume of the molding chambers is adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the thermal setting molding module is used to make inserts for dosage forms. The inserts can be made in any shape or size. For instance, irregularly shaped inserts (or dosage forms per se) can be made, that is shapes having no more than one axis of symmetry. Generally however, cylindrically shaped inserts are desired.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The inserts are formed by injecting a starting material in flowable form into the molding chamber. The starting material preferably comprises an medicant and a thermal setting material at a temperature above the melting point of the thermal setting material but below the decomposition temperature of the medicant. The starting material is cooled and solidifies in the molding chamber into a shaped pellet (i.e., having the shape of the mold). Injection and molding of the inserts preferably occurs as the thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> rotates. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, a transfer device <b>700</b> (as described above) transfers shaped pellets from the thermal setting molding module to a compression module <b>100</b> (also described above) as generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to embed the shaped pellets into a volume of powder before such powder is compressed into a dosage form in the compression module.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The starting material must be in flowable form. For example, it may comprise solid particles suspended in a molten matrix, for example a polymer matrix. The starting material may be completely molten or in the form of a paste. The starting material may comprise a medicant dissolved in a molten material. Alternatively, the starting material may be made by dissolving a solid in a solvent, which solvent is then evaporated from the starting material after it has been molded.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The starting material may comprise any edible material which is desirable to incorporate into a shaped form, including medicants, nutritionals, vitamins, minerals, flavors, sweeteners, and the like. Preferably, the starting material comprises a medicant and a thermal setting material. The thermal setting material may be any edible material that is flowable at a temperature between about 37 and about 120° C., and that is a solid at a temperature between about 0 and about 35° C. Preferred thermal setting materials include water-soluble polymers such as polyalkylene glycols, polyethylene oxides and derivatives, and sucrose esters; fats such as cocoa butter, hydrogenated vegetable oil such as palm kernel oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, and soybean oil; mono- di- and triglycerides, phospholipids, waxes such as Carnauba wax, spermaceti wax, beeswax, candelilla wax, shellac wax, microcrystalline wax, and paraffin wax; fat-containing mixtures such as chocolate; sugar in the form on an amorphous glass such as that used to make hard candy forms, sugar in a supersaturated solution such as that used to make fondant forms; low-moisture polymer solutions such as mixtures of gelatin and other hydrocolloids at water contents up to about 30% such as those used to make “gummi” confection forms. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the thermal setting material is a water-soluble polymer such as polyethylene glycol.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82-85</figref> depict a preferred embodiment of the thermal setting molding module <b>400</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref> is a side view, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83</figref>, <b>84</b> and <b>85</b>A-D are front views. The thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> generally includes a main rotor <b>402</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 82</figref>, on which are mounted a plurality of injection nozzle assemblies <b>404</b>. Each injection nozzle assembly <b>404</b> includes a housing <b>406</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82-84</figref>, comprising a flow path <b>408</b> through which the starting material may flow. Mounted to each housing <b>406</b> are a plurality of nozzles <b>410</b>. Although any number of nozzles may be employed in each injection nozzle assembly <b>404</b>, preferably four are present. Mounted below each injection nozzle assembly <b>404</b> is a thermal mold assembly <b>420</b> comprising a plurality of molding chambers <b>422</b> that correspond to the nozzles <b>410</b> in each injection nozzle assembly <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">A control valve <b>412</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</figref>, is disposed within the housing <b>406</b> for controlling the flow of starting material to each nozzle <b>410</b>. Disposed above the valve <b>412</b> may be a valve seat <b>414</b> and a gasket <b>416</b> for sealing the valve <b>412</b> when it is in the closed position. Each flow path <b>408</b> is connected to a reservoir <b>418</b> of starting material. Preferably, reservoir <b>418</b> is pressurized and heated with a suitable type of heater (such an electronic resistance or induction type heat) to a temperature whereby the starting material will flow. In a preferred embodiment where the starting material comprises a polymer such as polyethylene glycol, the temperature of the starting material is maintained between about 50 and 80° C. in the reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Mounted below the nozzles is a plate <b>428</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>82</b> and <b>85</b>A-D. The plate <b>428</b> moves with nozzles <b>410</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85A-D</figref> and as described below. Disposed within the plate <b>428</b> are cooling channels <b>424</b> for coolant fluid to flow around the plate <b>428</b>. The nozzles are preferably heated, for example by a heat transfer fluid delivered through channels <b>430</b> in housing <b>406</b>. Coolant is provided to the mold assembly <b>420</b> and the plates <b>428</b>. As described below, coolant flows through channels <b>424</b> in order to cool and thereby harden the injected starting material. Plates <b>428</b> are coupled to the housing <b>406</b> by any suitable means and in the preferred embodiment mechanical fasteners can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>, shafts <b>442</b> are preferably slidably mounted within linear bearings <b>440</b>. Preferably two shafts are present. Disposed beneath the housing <b>406</b> and around a portion of the shafts <b>442</b> that extend from the housing are springs <b>444</b>. Shafts <b>442</b> extend beneath the springs <b>444</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85A-D</figref> into a block <b>446</b>. As shown in FIGS. <b>82</b> and <b>85</b>A-D, and as described in more detail below, block <b>446</b> is moveable in response to a cam follower <b>448</b>, thereby moving closer to housing <b>406</b> by compressing springs <b>444</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85A-D</figref>, block <b>446</b> is mounted about two shafts <b>450</b> and moves up and down with the shafts <b>450</b>. Shafts <b>450</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85A-D</figref>, are mounted within a bearing <b>452</b> that is coupled to cam follower <b>448</b>, which rides in a cam track of the type known in the art. As cam follower <b>448</b> travels around the thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> due to rotation of the rotor <b>402</b>, cam follower <b>448</b> rides up and down in the cam track. As cam follower <b>448</b> moves up and down, housing <b>406</b>, plate <b>428</b> and nozzles <b>410</b> also move. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85A</figref>, cam follower <b>448</b> is at a high point. As rotor <b>402</b> rotates, cam follower <b>448</b> rides down in the cam track and moves the mechanically linked bearing <b>452</b> and block <b>446</b> in the downward direction to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85B</figref>. Housing <b>406</b> and plate <b>428</b> also move. In this position, plate <b>428</b> is disposed proximate to molding chambers <b>422</b>, but nozzles <b>410</b> are still disposed below the molding chambers <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85C</figref>, continued rotation of rotor <b>402</b> moves cam follower <b>448</b> downward within the cam track. Plate <b>428</b>, which is coupled to housing <b>406</b>, cannot move downward because it is disposed against the thermal setting mold assembly <b>420</b>. Consequently, block <b>446</b> exerts a force on springs <b>444</b>, compressing them. Block <b>446</b> pushes housing <b>406</b> down into plate <b>428</b> and proximate the molding chambers <b>422</b>. In this position, the starting material can be injected through the nozzles <b>410</b> and into the molding chambers <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">When housing <b>406</b> moves down as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85C</figref>, control valve <b>412</b> opens due to action of valve cam follower <b>417</b> in valve cam track <b>419</b>. Starting material is ported through control valve <b>412</b> and nozzles <b>410</b> to fill mold chambers <b>422</b>. Similarly, when cam follower <b>417</b> moves down from the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85C</figref> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85D</figref>, control valve <b>412</b> closes to stop the flow of starting material. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, valve <b>412</b> is designed to provide a “suck back” action upon closing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83 and 84</figref>, the valve seat <b>414</b> preferably has the geometry of a gradually tapering hole extending from edge <b>414</b>A to bottoming point <b>414</b>B. As gasket <b>416</b>, which is preferably made of an elastomeric material, moves to a closed position it enters the tapered valve seat <b>414</b> and creates a seal against the wall of the valve seat <b>414</b>. As gasket <b>416</b> continues to move it acts like a piston forcing fluid in front of it and behind it to move upward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</figref>. This in turn sucks back fluid from the tips of the nozzles <b>410</b>, which assures that no starting material drools from or accumulates on the tips of the nozzles. The volume of starting material sucked back by movement of gasket <b>416</b> can be controlled and adjusted by the depth to which the gasket penetrates into the valve seat.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>, the thermal setting mold assemblies <b>420</b> are mounted to the rotor <b>402</b> by any suitable means. In a preferred embodiment, mechanical fasteners are used. When used in conjunction with other operating modules, rotor <b>402</b> may be attached to a common drive system with the other modules, so that they rotate in synchronicity, preferably by driven motor <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">A preferred embodiment of a thermal setting mold assembly <b>420</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>, which is a cross-section. Although one thermal setting mold assembly <b>420</b> is depicted, each of the thermal setting mold assemblies <b>420</b> are preferably the same.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Each thermal setting mold assembly <b>420</b> preferably comprises a plurality of molding chambers <b>422</b>, which are empty volumetric spaces within the thermal setting mold inserts <b>423</b>. Preferably, one thermal setting mold insert <b>423</b> corresponds with each nozzle <b>410</b>. In a preferred embodiment, there are four thermal setting mold inserts <b>423</b> aligned with each of four nozzles <b>410</b>, as best understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 82 and 85</figref>. Although the molding chambers <b>422</b> may be any shape and size suitable for molding, they are preferably generally cylindrically shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Disposed within each thermal setting mold insert <b>423</b> is a piston <b>434</b>. It will be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> that placement of piston <b>434</b> within the each thermal setting mold insert <b>423</b> defines the volume of the mold cavity <b>422</b>. By specifically sizing each mold cavity <b>422</b> and adjusting the position of piston <b>434</b>, a desired volume and therefore proper dosage of the starting material is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Preferably, the pistons <b>434</b> are adjustably controlled by the position of cam follower <b>470</b> and associated cam track <b>468</b>. Pistons <b>434</b> are attached to piston attachment block <b>436</b> by suitable mechanical means so that pistons <b>434</b> move with piston attachment block <b>436</b>. Piston attachment block <b>436</b> slides along the shafts <b>464</b> up and down. Preferably, there are two shafts <b>464</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>. Mounted to piston attachment block <b>436</b> is cam follower <b>470</b>. One or more springs <b>466</b> bias piston attachment block <b>436</b> and therefore pistons <b>434</b> into the inject position as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85C</figref>. As thermal setting mold assembly <b>420</b> travels with rotor <b>402</b>, cam follower <b>468</b> riding in its cam track actuates pistons <b>434</b> into the eject position, which empties the molding chamber in preparation for the next cycle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Accordingly, during operation of the thermal setting molding module <b>400</b>, nozzles <b>410</b> move up during rotation of the thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> and inject a starting material into molding chambers <b>422</b>. Next, starting material is hardened within the molding chambers <b>422</b> into shaped pellets. Nozzles <b>410</b> are then retracted from the molding chambers. All of this occurs as the molding chambers <b>422</b> and nozzles <b>410</b> are rotating. After the starting material has hardened into shaped pellets, it is ejected from the molding chambers. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 87 and 88</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">When used with a transfer device <b>700</b> according to the invention, the transfer device <b>700</b> rotates between the molding chambers <b>422</b> and plate <b>428</b>. The retainers <b>330</b> of the transfer device <b>700</b> receive the shaped pellets and transfers them to the another operating module, for example a compression module <b>100</b>. In the case of coupling a thermal setting molding module <b>400</b> with a compression module <b>100</b> via a transfer device <b>700</b>, transfer device <b>700</b> inserts a shaped pellet into each die cavity <b>132</b> after the fill zone <b>102</b> but before the compression zone <b>106</b> of the compression module. It will be appreciated that a linked thermal setting molding module <b>400</b>, transfer device <b>700</b> and compression module <b>100</b> are synchronized so that a shaped pellet is placed into each die cavity <b>132</b>. The process is a continuous one of forming shaped pellets, transferring the shaped pellets, and inserting the shaped pellets.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The thermal setting molding module has several unique features. One is the ability to mass produce shaped pellets relatively rapidly, in particular molded dosage forms comprising polymers that are typically solids or solid-like between about 0 and about 35° C. The thermal setting molding module accomplishes this is by heating the starting material prior to injecting it into the molding chambers and then cooling the starting material after injection.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Another unique feature of the thermal setting molding module is the adjustable volume of the molding chambers. Adjustability and tuning of volume and therefore weight is especially advantageous for the production of shaped pellets comprising high potency or highly concentrated drugs, which are dosed in small amounts. Another advantage of the thermal setting molding module is that it can employ liquids. Unlike a particulate solid, such as powders typically used to make dosage forms, the volume of a liquid is relatively invariable at constant temperature. Density variations, which are troublesome in powder compression, are therefore avoided with liquids. Very accurate weights, especially at very low weights (i.e. with starting materials comprising high potency medicants) are achievable. Moreover, blend uniformity is also less assured with solid powders. Powder beds tend to segregate based on differences in particle size, shape, and density.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Another advantage of the thermal setting molding module is that it molds starting material while continuously rotating. This permits its integration with other continuously operating rotary devices, resulting in a continuous process. Conventional molding operations are typically stationary and have one nozzle feeding multiple mold cavities. Runners are often formed using in conventional equipment. By providing a nozzle for each molding chamber, runners are eliminated. Preferably, one control valve controls multiple nozzles. This simplifies the design of the thermal setting molding module, reducing cost. The thermal setting molding module may, of course be designed to operate without rotation of the rotor, for example on an indexing basis whereby a stationary group of nozzles engages molding chambers on a indexing rotary turn table or a linear recalculating indexing belt or platen system. However, by using a rotary system higher output rates can be achieved since products are continuously produced.</p>

<p id="p-0309" num="0308">A series of tablets having a molded gelatin coating thereon were made according to the invention as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Part A: Compressed Tablets</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The following ingredients were mixed well in a plastic bag: 89.4 parts acetaminophen USP (590 mg/tablet) and 8.0 parts of synthetic wax X-2068 T20 (53 mg/tablet). Next, 2.1 parts of sodium starch glycolate (EXPLOTAB) (13.9 mg/tablet) and 0.09 parts of silicon dioxide (0.6 mg/tablet) were added to the bag, and mixed well. Then 0.36 parts of magnesium stearate NF (2.4 mg/tablet) were added to the bag, and the ingredients were again mixed. The resulting dry blend was compressed into tablets on a compression module according to the invention using 7/16inch extra deep concave tablet tooling.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">The resulting tablets had an average weight of 660 mg, thickness of 0.306 inches, and hardness of 3.2 kp.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">The tablets from Part A were conveyed to a thermal cycle molding module according to the invention via a transfer device also according to the present invention. The tablets were coated with red gelatin on one half thereof, and yellow gelatin on the other half thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The red gelatin coating was made as follows. Purified water (450 g), Opatint Red DD-1761 (4.4 g), and Opatint Yellow DD-2125 (1.8 g) were mixed at room temperature till uniform. 275 Bloom Pork Skin Gelatin (150 g) and 250 Bloom Bone Gelatin (150 g) were added together in a separate container. The dry gelatin granules were manually stirred to mix. The purified water/Opatint solution was added to the gelatin granules, and mixed for about 1 minute to completely wet the gelatin granules. The gelatin slurry was placed in a water bath and heated to 55° C. to melt and dissolve the gelatin. The gelatin solution was held at 55° C. for approximately 3 hours (holding times at this temperature can generally range between about 2 and about 16 hours). The solution was then mixed until uniform (about 5 to 15 minutes), and transferred to a jacketed feed tank equipped with a propeller-type electric mixer. The gelatin solution was maintained at 55° C. with continuous mixing during its use in the thermal cycling molding module.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">The yellow gelatin coating was made as follows. Purified water (450 g), and Opatint Yellow DD-2125 (6.2 g) were mixed at room temperature till uniform. 275 Bloom Pork Skin Gelatin (150 g) and 250 Bloom Bone Gelatin (150 g) were added together in a separate container. The dry gelatin granules were stirred manually to mix. The purified water/Opatint solution was added to the gelatin granules, and mixed for about 1 minute to completely wet the gelatin granules.

Cast films (approximately 0.8 mm thick) were prepared using a stainless steel mold (2″×5″×0.8 mm). The solution was transferred to a jacketed beaker (80° C.) and de-aerated by vacuum for 6 hours. A second film was prepared using the same mold.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Increasing PEO from 15 to 25% (with corresponding decrease in PEG from 85 to 75%) increased yield stress (maximum force per unit area which can be applied before the film will deform permanently), and increased strain (% film elongation at break point).</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">Decreasing glycerin from 10% to 2% increased Tensile Strength (force per unit area required to break the film). Deaerating the glycerin-containing films prior to casting generally decreased tensile strength.</p>

<p id="p-0330" num="0329">The (5 qt) bowl of a planetary mixer (Hobart Corp., Dayton, Ohio) was heated to 80° C. by circulating hot water. PEG 3350 granular was poured into the bowl and melted to form a liquid. The white beeswax, color solution, and polyethylene oxide were added while mixing at low speed. The resulting mixture was mixed for a total of 12 minutes, then allowed to stand in the Hobart bowl for 2 hours while maintaining the temperature at 80° C. Cast films were prepared using a glass slide. The solution was transferred to a jacketed beaker (80° C.) and de-aerated by vacuum for 6 hours. A second film was prepared using the same mold.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">The white beeswax formula had increased tensile strength compared to the glycerin formulas.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">Examples 4 and 5 illustrate suitable formulations for the flowable material. Advantageously, these formulations are solvent (including water) free. This eliminates the need to evaporate solvent from coatings made from such formulations, shortening and simplifying drying. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, the flowable material is substantially solvent-free, that is contains less than about 1 weight percent, preferably no, solvent.</p>
