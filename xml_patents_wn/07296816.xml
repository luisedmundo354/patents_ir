<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Dollies, trailers, wagons, hand trucks, wheeled platforms, etc., are all generally used to move objects. Examples of these devices are common in warehouse or shipping environments. Although they are useful for their customary applications, they may be unsuitable for use in other transporting activities. For example, many sports use unwieldy pieces of equipment such as surf boards, snowboards, kayaks, canoes, or windsurfing boards that are not amenable to transportation by generally available dollies or trailers. Moving such equipment to the location of intended use can be difficult. In another example, a massive hand truck may not be available for transporting lumber at a remote building site. The structure, bulk, or weight of a transporting device can interfere with the activity itself. For example, upon reaching a destination for kayaking, the question arises as to what to do with the transporting device. Disassembly and portage of common transporters is typically impractical.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By way of example, a surfer who lives some distance from a beach may face limited transportation choices. First, the surfer may lift and carry a surf board to the beach, which can be difficult given a board's weight, its tendency to catch the wind, and the potential distance involved. Secondly, the surfer could load the board onto an automobile or golf cart. If the beach does not allow parking, or if the surfer does not own these vehicles, then the surfer may not have this choice. Third, the surfer may seek out a device that aids in transporting the board to the beach, such as a sling to help carry the board, or a dolly or trailer to make the board more mobile. Of course, the heavier the equipment, as with kayaks or canoes, the more severe the problem. This situation is also common to non-sporting equipment such as coolers, lumber, umbrellas, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Clearly, a device that bears even some of the weight of such equipment, while improving its mobility (without otherwise harming its performance) would be valuable. However, as mentioned above, the structure required in many existing approaches introduces problems of weight, transportability of the transporting device itself, and manageability in use. On the other hand, some lightweight transporters can be unstable or limited in the weight born. Aids or systems for transporting equipment fall into several exemplary categories.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first category of such systems are carriers or slings that aid in carrying equipment. Typically, these devices are directed to relocating and/or redistributing the load of the equipment, so as to enable the person to move while carrying the equipment. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,804,025 to Bear disclosed a padded carrying harness or pouch for surf boards with a spreader bar that creates an inverted V-shape in a shoulder strap to improve load distribution, comfort, and control. Except for the spreader bar, much of the pouch could be fabricated from lightweight material. However, the person must still carry the full weight of the equipment and the harness for the distance involved; further, winds could still exert difficult to manage forces on the board.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some carriers seek to improve the manageability of awkward equipment. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,254 to Challoner disclosed a carrier case for smaller recreational boards. This design uses a flat base for the equipment, straps and pouches to hold the equipment to the base, and at least one shoulder strap for carrying. This carrier is envisioned to operate as a backpack, which might improve handling over a sling in windy conditions; however, this invention is unsuitable for larger equipment, such as surfboards, kayaks, or windsurfing boards, which are not easily carried on the back without inhibiting motion, or throwing the carrying individual off balance. This device also relies on the person's ability to carry the full weight of the equipment and carrier case.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some transporters bear some of the weight of the equipment, typically by positioning wheels underneath the equipment. These structures are often configured so that wheels bear the weight under one end while the individual leads or pulls the equipment by the other. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,602,802 comprises a sail board dolly where a U-shaped frame with wheels supports the board and a strap of other means holds the board in place. The individual may then pull the equipment by a strap situated at the end of the board opposite the wheels. The rigid frame in this design carries some inherent weight and bulk, which affects its portability and ease of use. Another example of a dolly is U.S. Pat. No. 4,712,803 to Garcia. This dolly is a collapsible frame with wheels. A sailboard may rest within a crotch of the frame. The frame is fashioned of lightweight tubing, configured in a structure that can be collapsed using a scissors-like movement. The collapsible nature of this dolly is an improvement over the rigid structure described above; however, even when collapsed, this invention still presents weight and bulk that can be inconvenient. These two examples are also limited to specific equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,259 to Castillo reveals a bicycle trailer with an elongated support member running from a bicycle attachment point to at least one wheel that carries the weight of the equipment. The equipment rests either in rigid racks or in a utility bag supported by the elongated member. This design involves considerable framework, with its attendant weight and bulk. As intended, this framework may be suitable for bicycle transport, but could inhibit personal use without a bicycle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A combination dolly and trailer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,327 to Gieske. This invention involves a tube with wheels (or wheel assemblies), having a cylindrical foam pad on which a sail or surf boards may rest. Two strap assemblies loop about the axle at each end and are kept from sliding on the axle by hook and loop tape. The two strap assemblies buckle together over the board to hold it in place; in addition, one of the assemblies provides a coupling strap (and buckle) that runs longitudinally toward the front of the board. Placed at the front, underneath the board is a padded tubular T-member that is used for pulling and steering the equipment. The user grips the trunk or base of the T-member, while the arms are used for stabilization. A strap runs through the arms of the tubular T in the form of a loop. The padded T-member, being situated under the board, is held to the board by a loop formed by the front strap, when tightened. The front strap connects to the rear strap via front-to-rear coupling strap that runs longitudinally toward the end of the board. Tension on the front-to-rear strap, combined with the weight of the equipment, is intended to keep the parts in proper orientation. This invention represents an advance over earlier designs, in that it could potentially reduce the weight of the transporter. When disassembled, the individual parts may take up less space than preceding designs. However, the various elements rely primarily on the tension of strap loops around the equipment for rigidity. Further, this design requires the consistent weight of the equipment to maintain orientation. If the load were to shift or bounce, then rigidity could be adversely affected. Transverse or steering forces are communicated to the device via straps. When an individual might seek to change direction on a resisting surface, such as a sandy beach, then the force on the T-member might loosen its strap and rigidity could be lost.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0049">The present invention is an equipment transport system capable of being provided in kit form. The transport system is easily assembled or disassembled, to enhance portability. In various forms, the system may transport equipment by hand, towed from a vehicle (e.g., bicycle), or mounted onto an automobile roof rack. The system uses the rigidity of the transported equipment as the structure for lightweight and manageable transportation. The term rigid in reference to equipment is intended to encompass all types of equipment that are not so flexible as to sag to the ground over the course of its length during transportation. Those skilled in the art will readily see that wheel diameter or other aspects of the invention may be altered to accommodate some flexible items that might risk sagging in certain applications. Alternatively, if transportation of non-rigid equipment is desired, then the present invention may require some additional supporting structure, which will be apparent in the description below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0050">In general, equipment simply refers to implements or items desired to be transported for some purpose, operation, or activity. The types of rigid items or equipment suitable for transportation by the present invention are widely variable. As discussed above, some of these items, such as surfboards, kayaks, or canoes, may be awkward or elongated, and clearly difficult to transport. For use with the present invention, the equipment should generally have at least two ends that are capable of fitting into the enclosure or pockets of the present invention; these two ends are referred to as a front end and a rear end for convenience and not directional limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0051">The present invention may be configured for a specific class of equipment or configured in a generic manner for a range of equipment or items. For example, one embodiment of the present invention may be tailored to accept and transport surf boards. Another embodiment of the present invention may be directed to kayaks. This tailoring can enhance the performance of the transport system, as further described below. However, the present invention is also contemplated as being provided in a general or utility embodiment with pocket size determined by a generic volume appropriate to the contemplated uses. The invention may thus be adapted for transporting a wide variety of rigid items, such as lumber, wind surfers, tents, ice chests, beach umbrellas, yard tools, ladders, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0052">With reference to the drawings, an embodiment of the present invention <b>40</b> assembled and being used manually to tow equipment <b>50</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Major items shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> include head piece <b>70</b>, tail piece <b>10</b>, two wheels <b>21</b>, and a portion of tensioner <b>26</b>. Tail piece <b>10</b> and head piece <b>70</b> may be manufactured from a durable, lightweight fabric, screen, nylon, mesh, rubber, neoprene, cloth, or other pliable material known to those in the art. Head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b> are shaped to define pockets or enclosures for insertion of equipment <b>50</b>. As shown, rear end of equipment <b>50</b> may be inserted into tail piece <b>10</b>, and front end of equipment <b>50</b> may be inserted into head piece <b>70</b>. In general, tensioner <b>26</b> operates to draw a tension between head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b>, so that the resistance or rigidity of the equipment <b>50</b> provides structure for the transport system. As noted above, tail piece <b>10</b> and head piece <b>70</b> may be tailored to fit about the equipment <b>50</b> to be transported; this embodiment is tailored for a surf board. As shown, tail piece <b>10</b> may be tailored to avoid any obstructions typical for a class of equipment <b>50</b>, such as the fins on a surf board, but large enough to grip equipment <b>50</b> securely.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0053">In use, the forces arising from towing are distributed by head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b> over the corresponding enclosed surface areas of equipment <b>50</b>. As noted above, head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b> may be tailored or fitted to create pockets or enclosures specific to a single type of equipment <b>50</b>; this may provide more secure seating and effective distribution of forces, but it may also limit the ability to accommodate other types of equipment <b>50</b>. However, if head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b> are created from a pliable fabric, then these pieces may simply be sized to form generic pockets or enclosures that are large enough to accommodate the desired types of equipment, and excess fabric will typically collapse around the equipment when tensioner <b>26</b> draws a tension.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the components of the equipment transport system <b>40</b> in kit form. Tail piece <b>10</b> is adapted to mount and bear a wheel assembly <b>20</b> in a substantially transverse orientation to the direction of motion. In this example, tail piece <b>10</b> includes axle sleeve <b>12</b>, which is adapted to receive and support optional pipe <b>25</b> and axle <b>24</b> of wheel assembly <b>20</b>. Axle sleeve <b>12</b> is long enough to provide effective support to wheel assembly <b>20</b>, but shorter than axle <b>24</b> so that wheels <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> may be detachably mounted onto exposed ends of axle <b>24</b>. For this embodiment, wheel assembly <b>20</b> includes axle <b>24</b>, wheels <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>, and a quick release mechanism <b>22</b>, such as a cotter pin, with protective washer <b>23</b> for each end of axle <b>24</b>. Optional pipe <b>25</b> is preferably a lightweight and durable rigid material, such as PVC. Pipe <b>25</b> slides into axle sleeve <b>12</b> of tailpiece <b>10</b>; axle <b>24</b> may then be placed inside pipe <b>25</b>, such that optional pipe <b>25</b> operates as a housing or bushing for axle <b>24</b> and prevents wear of axle sleeve <b>12</b>. Those skilled in the art will readily see that wheel assembly <b>20</b> and the means for mounting wheel assembly <b>20</b> to tail piece <b>10</b> may take any one of a variety of configurations while still preserving the portability and light weight characteristics of the invention. Examples of configurations other than axle sleeve <b>12</b> for axle <b>24</b> may include plastic or metal bearings mounted onto plastic or rubber patches that are affixed or sewn to tail piece <b>10</b>; similarly attached clips, detents, snap lock fittings, or other equivalent mechanisms to grip axle <b>24</b> may also be used. Alternative configurations of cloth mounts for axle <b>24</b> may be strap supports, hook and loop or zipper fastened enclosures, etc. Axle <b>24</b> may rotate within sleeve <b>12</b> or optional pipe <b>25</b> during transportation, or may be stationary with wheels <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> rotatably mounted onto axle <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view of transport system <b>40</b>, which reveals tensioner <b>26</b> drawing a tension between head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b> (obscured by wheel <b>21</b>). In simple embodiments, tensioner <b>26</b> may be an elastic or adjustable tie or strap capable of being fastened to tail piece <b>10</b> and head piece <b>70</b>, and equipped to draw a tension between the two pieces. Tensioner <b>26</b> is preferably constructed of durable and lightweight strapping material, such as cloth, leather, heavy duty rubber, or elastic cord, or some combination thereof. However, tensioner <b>26</b> may be comprised of other materials that are sufficiently durable, pliable, and well suited to create and withstand tensioning.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0056">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, tensioner <b>26</b> includes tensioner device <b>26</b><i>d</i>, which may be such tensioning mechanisms known to the art, such as elastic strapping material, adjustable buckles or turnbuckles, strap tighteners, cinches, ratchets, cams, winches, springs, tension levers, clamps, hydraulic cylinders, rotating shafts, etc. The shape or configuration of tensioner <b>26</b> may be any that effects the purpose described herein, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As may be seen in this embodiment, tensioner <b>26</b> may draw a tension between head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b>, while also serving the beneficial function of a strut or lateral support for axle <b>24</b>. For this example, tensioner <b>26</b> is a strap assembly having at least three strap ends: center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>and arms <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>is adapted to be fastened to head piece <b>70</b>. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, arms <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>of tensioner <b>26</b> may provide openings for insertion of the ends of axle <b>24</b>; these openings are preferably protected from wear, as with grommets or other means known to those skilled in the art. During assembly of the kit, axle strap <b>26</b> is oriented such that center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>points toward head piece <b>70</b> and away from axle <b>24</b>. Openings in arms <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>are placed over the right and left portions of axle <b>24</b>, inside or prior to mounting wheels <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>, but outside axle sleeve <b>12</b>. Preferably, the diameter of openings in arms <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>are sized to be smaller than the diameter of pipe <b>25</b>, but larger than axle <b>24</b>. The length of pipe <b>25</b> may be optimized to create desired angles in the arms of the tensioner <b>26</b> so that arms <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>act as effective struts or lateral supports when center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>is placed under tension. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates this with a bottom view of an embodiment of the invention. As shown, tension device <b>26</b><i>d </i>may be an adjustable buckle by which a manual tension may be placed on tensioner <b>26</b>. When tensioner <b>26</b> draws a tension, it may assume a Y shape as arms <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>draw against axle <b>24</b> and center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>draws against head piece <b>70</b>. For this arrangement, tension is imparted to tail piece <b>10</b> by way of mounted axle <b>24</b>. If tensioner <b>26</b> is fabricated from a material that is less pliable, then the shape of tensioner <b>26</b> may be modified to achieve a Y or U shape even without tension if such balanced struts or lateral supports are desired. Thus, after arms <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>are connected to axle <b>24</b>, center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>is attached to head piece <b>70</b> and a tension is drawn between head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b> by way of axle <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0057">Wheels <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> are detachably mounted at each end of axle <b>24</b>, preferably using a quick-release mechanism <b>22</b> or similar disconnect arrangement known to those skilled in the art, such as lynch pins, wheel locks, threaded caps, cotter pins, detents, etc., to permit rapid assembly or disassembly. The design of wheels <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> may be either multi-purpose or targeted to a particular environment, such as sand tires for beach uses. Washers <b>23</b>, <b>23</b>, or other separating means, may be positioned on axle <b>24</b> between each wheel <b>21</b> and the associated quick release mechanism <b>22</b> to protect such mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0058">Some features of the front or head components may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Head piece <b>70</b> defines an enclosure to receive a front end or head of equipment <b>50</b>. Head piece <b>70</b> may provide an optional buckle, tie, or other mating connector <b>73</b> with which center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>of tensioner <b>26</b> may fasten, shown here by connector <b>26</b><i>c</i>. Alternatively, center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>may include a jaw clip, hook and loop, or other connector (not shown) for attaching to the material of head piece <b>70</b> as well as tail piece <b>10</b>. Thus, center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>of tensioner <b>26</b> may be fastened to headpiece <b>70</b> by connector <b>73</b> and tensioner connector <b>26</b><i>c</i>, or other such means known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, tensioning device <b>26</b><i>d </i>is incorporated into center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>to exert a force that pulls headpiece <b>70</b> and axle assembly <b>20</b>, mounted on tail piece <b>10</b>, together. In this case, tensioning device <b>26</b><i>d </i>is an adjustable buckle incorporated into center strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>of tensioner <b>26</b>. As discussed above, the tension force causes equipment <b>50</b> to seat more snugly into the enclosures of tail piece <b>10</b> and head piece <b>70</b>. That is, when strap <b>26</b><i>s </i>is tightened, it causes head piece <b>70</b> and tail piece <b>10</b> to move together, gripping more securely about equipment <b>50</b>, causing the whole unit to become rigid. Those skilled in the art may contemplate a variety ways or configurations to create such a seating force; as noted above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0060">In a typical embodiment, head piece <b>70</b> features handle <b>72</b>. Handle <b>72</b> might be a simple loop of strap material, or other means suitable for carrying, steering, and/or pulling equipment <b>50</b>. Handle <b>72</b> may also be a loop sized such that it can be both securely wrapped about an average beach bicycle seat, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or gripped by hand. The pocketed design of tail piece <b>10</b> and head piece <b>70</b> enables a greater distribution area for the distribution of forces, enhancing maneuverability and control. Alternatively, handle <b>72</b> may include an adaptor to affixing the transport system to a trailer hitch, seats or other appropriate features on motorcycles, all terrain vehicles, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0061">In another typical embodiment, the transport system <b>40</b> may be adapted to mounting onto an automobile roof rack <b>30</b>.
