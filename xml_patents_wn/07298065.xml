<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to electric motors and in particular, to a brush holder assembly, for use with electric motors or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Brush assemblies for electric motors, especially small permanent magnet DC motors, are either cage brush assemblies or leaf brush assemblies. Leaf brushes are relatively inexpensive comprising essentially of an elongate cantilevered strip of resilient conductive material, typically beryllium copper, which is resiliently deformed against a rubbing contact surface of a commutator. A carbon based brush head may be attached to the distal end of the brush arm to make contact with the rubbing surface. Cage brush assemblies use a carbon based brush which is pressed against the commutator by a separate spring and guided towards the commutator by a rigid tube or cage usually of brass or an insulating plastic material. This is more stable and hence, more desirable but is also more expensive and harder to cool the brush.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hence, there is a desire for a stable brush assembly which is easy to cool yet inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, the present invention provides a brush assembly for an electric motor, the brush assembly comprising: a brush for making sliding contact with a commutator; a spring for resiliently urging the brush into contact with the commutator; a holder for supporting the brush and guiding the brush towards the commutator, the holder having a base and a plurality of projections extending from the base for supporting and guiding the brush, wherein the projections form rails and the brush has a plurality of grooves in which the rails are received for guiding and supporting the brush.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Preferably, there are two projections of circular cross section and the grooves in the brush are part-circular in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably, the brush assembly is adapted to be releasably attached to a brush plate of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the base and the projections are integrally formed as a monolithic construction and the projections form rails cantilevering from the holder and the brush is adapted to slide along the rails under the influence of the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the two projections are respective ends of a single rod and the rod has a substantially U-shaped middle portion forming a bottom with two arms extending therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the bottom is securely received in a recess in a brush plate of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the arms are U-shaped forming first and second arm portions which extend substantially perpendicularly from the base with the brush slidable along the projections being the free ends of the second portions of the arms and being proximate to the first portion of the arms and the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the brush has a stop projection located between the first portion of the arms and interfering with the bottom to limit movement of the brush away from the base.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternatively, the projections are separate U-shaped rods extending from respective first and second bases located on opposite lateral sides of the brush.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also provides an electric motor incorporating such a brush assembly.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The motor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a small PMDC motor suitable for high current, high power applications such as a portable hand held drill. The motor <b>10</b> has a housing formed by a rear housing <b>12</b> and a first end cap <b>14</b> and a second end cap <b>16</b>. The motor has a shaft <b>18</b> which can be seen extending through end cap <b>14</b>. The shaft is part of a wound rotor which includes a commutator and the rear housing <b>12</b> supports a permanent magnet stator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">End cap <b>16</b> comprises two parts, a metal outer plate and a plastic inner plate known as brush plate <b>20</b> as it supports the brush gear and other electrical components including motor terminals, where used.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this motor, the brush gear comprises two brush assemblies. One brush assembly <b>22</b> is shown exploded from the rest of the motor as it is a replaceable brush assembly meaning that the brush assembly can be replaced, if need be, (for example, if worn out or damaged) without disassembling the motor housing. The brush assembly is shown ready to be fitted to the brush plate by mounting it through a window <b>34</b> in the rear housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The brush assembly <b>22</b> comprises a brush holder <b>24</b>, a brush <b>26</b>, and a brush spring <b>28</b>. The brush holder <b>24</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The brush holder has a base <b>25</b> in the form of a stamped strip <b>36</b> of zinc plated steel sheet although other materials may be suitable such as brass sheet. The strip <b>36</b> has ends <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> bent or curved inwardly to roughly follow the contour of the rear housing. It has two mounting arms <b>42</b> which extend from a lower edge which are bent to extend inwardly horizontally. Each arm <b>42</b> has a barb <b>44</b> with a tapered face and an opposing rear shoulder <b>46</b>. A longitudinal slot <b>48</b> in the distal end of the arm <b>42</b> allows the barb <b>44</b> to be readily resiliently squeezed compared with the remaining part of the arm. The barb <b>44</b> or tapered face and shoulder provide a snap fit function as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The brush holder <b>24</b> has two projections formed by two pins <b>30</b> pressed fitted into two holes in the central portion of the strip <b>36</b>. The pins <b>30</b> extend perpendicular to the central portion and project inwardly substantially parallel to the arms <b>42</b>. The pins <b>30</b> form rails along which the brush <b>26</b> is slidingly guided into contact with a commutator.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One end <b>38</b> of the brush holder strip <b>36</b> (left hand end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) has two longitudinally extending slots forming three fingers <b>50</b>. The other end <b>40</b> of the strip <b>36</b> has a transverse slot <b>52</b> forming a squarish projection <b>54</b> with a small notch <b>56</b> formed in the end edge of the strip <b>36</b>. This projection <b>54</b> forms a holder or mount for the brush spring <b>28</b> and the notch <b>56</b> forms a spring seat in which an end of the spring is trapped. The other end of the spring is arranged to bear against the back of the brush to push it away from the brush holder <b>24</b>, in a sliding action along the pins <b>30</b>. A cut-out <b>58</b> in the central portion of the brush holder strip <b>36</b> provides access to the brush for the spring. A limb <b>60</b> extending partially across the cut-out <b>58</b>, and having a slotted end <b>62</b>, provides a handy rest for the brush end of the spring during assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the brush holder <b>24</b> with a brush <b>26</b> fitted and a terminal wire <b>32</b> attached. The brush <b>26</b> has two part circular grooves <b>64</b>, running axially along the longer sides. The pins <b>30</b> locate within the grooves <b>64</b> such that the brush <b>26</b> is smoothly slidable along the pins <b>30</b>. The brush <b>26</b> also has an embedded shunt wire <b>66</b> which extends laterally of the brush <b>26</b> and is electrically attached to the brush holder <b>24</b> by being welded to one or more of the three fingers <b>50</b>. A motor terminal wire <b>32</b> is also welded or otherwise electrically attached to one or more of the three fingers <b>50</b>, for connecting the brush <b>26</b> to an external source of power.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As mentioned previously, input end cap <b>16</b> has a metal cover supporting a bushing for the shaft <b>18</b> and a plastic material brush plate <b>20</b>, coupled to the metal cover. The brush plate <b>20</b> has mounts <b>60</b> for fixing the brush assemblies <b>22</b> to the end cap <b>16</b>. Each mount <b>68</b> comprises a pair of projections forming a tunnel <b>70</b> in which the mounting arms <b>42</b> of the brush holder <b>24</b> are a press fit. The barbs <b>44</b> are resiliently deformed as the arms <b>42</b> are pressed into the tunnels <b>70</b> and spring back when they clear the end of the tunnels <b>70</b> as the brush holder <b>24</b> is pressed into the fully inserted position. The shoulders <b>46</b> bear against the end walls of the outer tunnel projections preventing removal of the brush holder <b>24</b>. A slot <b>72</b> is located in the brush plate <b>20</b> adjacent the terminal fingers <b>50</b> for passage of the terminal lead <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">This construction particularly favors the use of terminal leads <b>32</b>. However, the brush holder <b>24</b> can be connected to motor terminals which would be fitted to motor terminal holders shown as projections <b>74</b> on the brush plate <b>20</b> The connection can be made by using a wire, brass strip or an extension of the motor terminal to connect to the brush holder, preferably by welding or a resilient connection.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">To release the brush holder <b>24</b> from the brush plate <b>20</b>, for example, to replace the brush assembly, prongs of a tweezer-like tool <b>76</b> are inserted into a recess <b>78</b> in the end cap <b>16</b> which exposes the distal ends of the mounting arms <b>42</b> and pressed against the barbs <b>44</b> to resiliently bend the shoulders <b>46</b> away from the wall at the end of the tunnel <b>70</b> allowing the mounting arms <b>42</b> to be withdrawn from the tunnel <b>70</b> and the brush assembly <b>24</b> to be withdrawn from the motor <b>10</b> through the window <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The pin-like projections or rails <b>30</b> provide the brush <b>26</b> with a very stable brush position similar to a cage brush assembly as movement of the brush <b>26</b> is prevented by the rails <b>30</b> within the grooves <b>64</b> in all directions except axially along the rails <b>30</b>. At the same time, the brushes <b>26</b> are fully exposed except for the small area of the projections <b>30</b> and thus, this brush assembly <b>22</b> has the stability of a cage brush assembly with the exposure and thus, the coolability of a leaf brush assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The brush assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which is shown in partially exploded and partially assembled state, has a brush <b>26</b> with two longitudinal grooves <b>64</b>. The grooves <b>64</b> allow the brush <b>26</b> to slide along two projections in the form of rails or pins <b>30</b>. The projections <b>30</b> are opposite ends of a single length of wire or round stock <b>80</b> which is bent so the ends extend generally in the same direction with a middle portion <b>82</b> which is securely received in a recess <b>84</b> in the end cap. In this manner, the rails <b>30</b> guide the brush <b>26</b> towards sliding contact with a commutator of a rotor. The brush, in use, is urged into contact with the commutator by a spring (not shown) and electrical contact between the brush and a motor terminal (not shown) is by way of an embedded shunt (also not shown) and may or may not involve additional electrical components for noise suppression, such as a choke (also not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the round stock <b>80</b> is shown as being insertable into a recess <b>84</b>, the round stock <b>80</b> could be directly molded into the material of the end cap <b>16</b> to ensure a secure connection. While this may offer more freedom in the shape of the stock <b>80</b>, it is a more expensive process and thus not as preferred as the embodiment illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The projections <b>30</b> or ends of the stock are described as extending generally in the same direction. This is because although ideally, the rails should run parallel with no gap between the pins and the surface of the grooves, this is not possible in reality due to manufacturing tolerances and the need for easy assembly. The rails need to allow the brush to be inserted between them easily and yet still hold the brush firmly or rigidly. This is made possible especially when the rails are in the form of pins by the resilient nature of the pins which can be resiliently deformed to widen the gap between the pins to allow insertion of the brush but yet still be rigid enough to prevent transverse or lateral movement of the brush during use, especially sidewise vibration caused by the rotation of the commutator trying to drag the brush. Problems with sliding clearance between the brush and the pins can also be overcome by utilizing the resilience of the pins. By setting the pins to be slightly convergent in their free state, the pins can be arranged to lightly grip the brush without sufficient force to significantly restrict the sliding of the brush along the pins. This removes the clearance necessary to allow the brush to slide and the additional clearance required to allow for manufacturing tolerances to avoid jamming of the brush as would occur, for example, in a cage brush assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The pins may also be shaped or bent to form a divergent mouth to allow easier insertion of the brushes or to avoid sharp leading edges of the pins which may bind on the brush.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although a replaceable brush holder is shown and preferred, the brush holder may be captured or fitted to the brush plate in a non-removable, non-replaceable manner, such as insertion barbs and overmolding.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</figref> illustrates such a connection between the brush holder and the end cap.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the projections <b>30</b> are formed from a single piece of round stock or rod <b>80</b> formed into a U-shape and bent twice so that the projections lay over or adjacent the bottom of the “U” with each arm <b>86</b> also being U-shaped with projections <b>30</b> extending parallel to the first portion of the arms adjacent the bottom <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The brush holder <b>24</b> is similar to the brush holder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> except that the mounting fingers <b>42</b> are replaced by axially insertable barbed fingers <b>43</b> which are pressed into holes in a plastic brush plate or end cap to fix the brush holder in place.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The projections <b>30</b> are fixed to the brush holder by sliding the formed round stock <b>80</b> through holes and/or gaps in the brush holder. Specifically, the projections pass through an open slot <b>47</b> and the bottom of the “U” and the first portion of the arms <b>86</b> pass through another slot <b>49</b> where they are captured by crimping or otherwise deforming material of the slot <b>49</b> onto the arms <b>86</b>. By crimping the first portion of the arms <b>86</b> and not the projections <b>30</b>, reduces the likelihood of altering the position of the projections during fixing.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first portion of the arms <b>86</b> and the bottom of the “U” <b>82</b> provides a second rail for the brush to sit on, giving added support or stiffness in the axial direction of the motor. This also provides a convenient stop for a brush stop detent.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which illustrates the brush assembly, a stop <b>65</b> is formed on the lower surface of the brush towards the back end of the brush. The stop <b>65</b> moves along and in between the first portion of the arms <b>86</b> until it reaches the bottom <b>82</b> of the “U”. When it engages the bottom <b>82</b>, it prevents further movement of the brush <b>26</b> away from the brush holder <b>24</b> under the influence of the spring <b>28</b>. The brush stop is used to prevent the brush from wearing too short resulting in either rubbing of an embedded shunt on the commutator or dislodgment of the brush from the brush holder, at the end of brush life.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a fourth embodiment fitted to a plastic end cap or brush plate <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the rail projections <b>30</b> are round stock formed into a U-shape with the arms crimped to respective individual support plates <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>. The support plates <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> are fixed to the brush plate <b>20</b> by plastic deformation of fixing projections <b>92</b> passing through locating holes. One support plate <b>90</b> has locating holes which are sized to receive the fixing projections <b>92</b> while the other support plate <b>91</b> has slotted holes <b>94</b> for receiving the fixing projections <b>92</b> to allow for adjusting the gap between the rail projections <b>30</b> to compensate for tolerances on the dimensions of the brush <b>26</b>. The rail projections are fixed to the supporting plates <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> by the arms <b>96</b> of the U-shape so that the base of the “U” forms the rail on which the brush <b>26</b> slides. Crimping is achieved by forming four posts <b>98</b> around each end of the arms <b>96</b>, preferably by stamping the support plate <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>. Once the arms <b>96</b> of the rails have been placed between the posts <b>98</b>, the posts are squeezed or otherwise plastically deformed to capture the rails. The first support plate <b>90</b> also supports the brush spring <b>28</b>. The brush shunt is omitted for simplicity but would electrically connect the brush directly to a motor terminal or to another component, e.g., a noise suppression component of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With the rails <b>30</b> formed in this manner, the ends of the projections/pins do not need special treatment to remove burrs as the end do not contact the brush.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, the present invention provides a brush assembly which is relatively easy to produce, has a stable brush position and yet the brush is almost completely exposed allowing cooling air to flow unimpeded around the sides of the brush.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The embodiments described above are given by way of example only and various modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, although round pins and semicircular grooves are shown, other cross-sectional shapes may be used as desired to restrict movement to the sliding direction and to reduce contact area, to reduce sliding friction or to improve manufacturability. For example, round or rectangular pins with triangular grooves, hexagonal or elliptical rails with square grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the preferred embodiment uses a sheet metal holder with pressed in rail or pin projections, a favorable construction could be a one piece molded or forged arrangement for the holder and projections. This gives greater freedom in the design of the projections and in strengthening of the projection/holder connection. Metal casting or forging such as brass, copper alloy and aluminum alloy, and plastic and ceramic molding may be suitable.</p>
