<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image reproduction system, and, more particularly to an image reproduction system preferably for use in a video printing system for printing out image information stored on a video tape.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hitherto, a video printing system <b>1</b> arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and capable of printing out an image signal by a video printer <b>11</b> thereof has been known, the image signal being supplied from a video camera <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The printing-out operation in the video printing system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is performed as follows. First, a picked up image signal is transmitted from video camera <b>10</b> to the video printer <b>11</b> as an analog signal. The transmitted image signal, that is, a picture signal, is monitored on a display <b>12</b>. On the other hand, the aforesaid analog signal is converted into a digital signal by an A/D converter <b>110</b> in the video printer <b>11</b>. A desired picture is stored in a field memory <b>111</b> at the timing specified by an operation key <b>116</b> as a still image. The stored picture is arbitrarily confirmed in such a manner that it is displayed on the display <b>12</b> when a switch <b>115</b> is switched on by manipulating the key <b>116</b>. Then, information stored in the field memory <b>111</b> is supplied to a printing image unit <b>114</b> so as to be printed out by the printing image unit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the conventional video print system <b>1</b>, it takes about one minute for the video printer <b>11</b> to print out one picture and the field memory <b>111</b> for only one picture is provided. Therefore, when printing of a plurality of pictures is desired, there is a necessity of waiting for completion of the operation of printing out one picture at the time of searching the next picture from the tape by a searching operation. Therefore, it leads to inconvenience at the time of the operation and a problem arises in that a too long time is required for a user to complete the printing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a case where a video tape recorder (VTR) for outputting a video signal in the form of a digital signal is connected to the aforesaid video printer, a buffer memory for processing the digital signal must be provided in addition to the aforesaid field memory. Therefore, a problem arises in that the cost cannot be reduced and the overall system cannot be made compact because the circuit becomes too complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, in a case where a picture corresponding to a video signal reproduced from a video tape recorder (VTR) is printed out by a printer, a desired picture in the reproduced signal supplied from the VTR is received by a memory in the printer and video data is read out from the memory at a predetermined speed so as to be printed out.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a schematic view which illustrates a system of the aforesaid conventional type. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, reference numeral <b>281</b> represents a VTR, <b>282</b> represents a monitor and <b>283</b> represents a video printer. The operation of printing out a desired picture selected from a multiplicity of pictures recorded on a tape will now be described briefly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">First, the VTR <b>281</b> is set to a reproduction mode in which the reproduced video signal supplied from the VTR <b>281</b> is caused to be supplied to the monitor <b>282</b> and the printer <b>283</b>. An operator operates the manipulation unit of the printer <b>283</b> at the timing when a desired picture is displayed on the monitor <b>282</b> while confirming the pictures on the monitor <b>282</b>. In response to the operation thus performed, a control unit <b>285</b> causes a memory unit <b>284</b> to store a video signal corresponding to one field (hereinafter called “one picture”) by controlling the memory unit <b>284</b>. When the memory unit <b>284</b> receives the video signals which correspond to the one picture, it reads out the video signals at a predetermined speed which corresponds to the printing speed of a printing unit <b>286</b>. As a result, a desired picture can be printed out by the printing unit <b>286</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hitherto, analog video signals are generally supplied from the VTR <b>281</b> to the printer <b>283</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a conventional system of the type described above, even if a plurality of pictures on one tape are printed out, the following operation must be repeatedly performed: one picture is selected, and then it is printed out while taking a relatively long time of about one minute for each picture and then the next picture is selected. Therefore, in a case where a multiplicity of pictures are printed out, the operator must operate the system until all of the pictures have been printed out while performing required manipulations.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a case where there is a desire of again printing out a picture which has been once printed out, it is substantially impossible to again select the same picture. That is, since the VTR records video signals for about 30 to 60 fields per second in a case of, for example, an NTSC, it records pictures of about 430,000 fields on a video tape capable of recording pictures for 120 minutes. Therefore, it is substantially impossible to again retrieve a specific picture from the aforesaid number of pictures.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic structural view which illustrates an embodiment of a video print system <b>100</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The system <b>100</b> comprises a VTR unit <b>90</b>, which is an image reproducing device, an analog signal input terminal <b>20</b><i>a </i>capable of receiving an analog signal supplied from, for example, a video camera <b>20</b>, a video printer unit <b>14</b> for receiving a digital signal supplied from the VTR unit <b>90</b> via a data bus <b>26</b> or an analog signal transmitted from the video camera <b>20</b> so as to print out pictures and a data compression/expansion unit <b>80</b> to be described later, the video printer unit <b>14</b> being an image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A buffer memory <b>65</b> is structured so as to be used commonly when it is properly switched at the time of the operation in such a manner that it serves as a buffer memory for a data bus in a case where it receives the signal in a digital manner under control of a controller <b>67</b> for the printer and it serves as a frame memory when a still image is extracted from an analog kinetic image signal at the specified timing made by a key input switch <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An analog signal transmitted from video camera <b>20</b> is quantized into a digital signal by an A/D converter <b>61</b> so as to be transmitted to a terminal of a data selector <b>77</b>. A printer <b>91</b> receives an output signal (image information) from the selector <b>77</b> via the buffer memory <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The VTR unit <b>90</b> comprises a VTR body <b>90</b><i>a</i>, a key input switch <b>46</b> serving as an input unit and a controller <b>42</b> for a camcorder serving as a retrieving unit. As a result, print retrieving information about an image to be printed can be recorded by an inputting operation performed with the key input switch <b>46</b> when image information is recorded on an 8 mm video tape <b>41</b>. The digital signal denoting the image to be printed is supplied to another end unit of the data selector <b>77</b> via interfaces <b>27</b>, <b>64</b> and the data bus <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, taking the 8 mm video tape <b>41</b> as an example, the way of recording various information items on the tape <b>41</b> by the VTR body <b>90</b><i>a </i>will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in the forming order of the recording tracks from a lower unit to an upwards diagonal direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the pattern of the recording tracks formed on the tape <b>41</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tape <b>41</b> stores the following recorded information items: PCM region E<b>1</b>, INDEX region E<b>2</b> and VIDEO region E<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The PCM region E<b>1</b> is a region in which digital data is recorded at a data rate of 0.5 M to 1.5 Mbps. In the PCM region E<b>1</b>, 8 to 16 bit quantizing stereo audio data, or field/frame digital still image information, and ID words (which consists of ID<b>0</b> to ID<b>5</b> and to which the sound quality, and the image quality, date of photography, and the like are recorded) for sub-code information about the aforesaid digital still image information, the sink and the address for re-constituting data, and a PQ parity for detecting an error or a CRCC for correcting an error, and the like are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The INDEX region E<b>2</b> is a region in which data is recorded by using a technology similar to that used at the time of the PCM recording operation and which is composed of a search signal serving as print retrieving information for retrieving and a data signal. A state where all of data items are of the search signal “0” means a normal state, while a state where all of that are “1” means an input of a head searching signal. Data signal is interposed between S (start block) and END (end block), and 5 blocks composed of data blocks BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>4</b> are disposed in the data signal. Each block is composed of data words “WD<b>0</b>” to “WD<b>4</b>” and “CRCC”. Since each word WD is capable of recording 8 bit data, the number of sheets to be printed out and the like can be set by an outer recording operation of the INDEX region E<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The frequency spectrum distribution of VIDEO region E<b>3</b> is arranged in such a manner that 4-frequency pilot signal (4f) for tape tracking at the time of reproduction is located in the lowest frequency region so that the analog image signal is recorded as brightness FM signal and low frequency conversion color signal and the analog audio signal is recorded as monaural FM signal or a summation and subtraction stereo signal (L+R, L−R) and a sound multiplex (man and sub) FM signal.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Data can be independently recorded/reproduced to and from the aforesaid information regions E<b>1</b> to E<b>3</b>. For example, a digital still image can be additionally recorded to the tape on which only analog information has been recorded or PCM sound can be recorded afterwards.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The thus structured operation of the video printing system <b>100</b> according to this embodiment will now be described with reference to the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">First, an operation to be performed at the time of recording information will now be described. At the time of the recording operation, the VTR unit <b>90</b> is connected to, for example, a video camera. An image signal photographed by the video camera <b>20</b> is processed by the analog signal processing circuit <b>34</b> in a known manner for the 8 mm video taper recorder. The audio signal received by a microphone <b>31</b> is amplified by an amplifier <b>32</b> before it is processed in a known manner for the 8 mm video tape recorder by the audio processing circuit <b>33</b>. The 4-frequency pilot signal (4f) supplied from the tracking servo circuit <b>38</b> for the known 8 mm video tape recorder is added to the image signal and the audio signal processed in predetermined manners in the circuits <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> by the adder <b>36</b> so that the signal to be recorded to the aforesaid VIDEO region E<b>3</b> is generated before it is supplied to the time-division signal distributor (SW<b>3</b>) <b>37</b>. When information such as a calender or a clock or the like for use in a so-called automatic date function possessed by the aforesaid video camera <b>20</b> are set by the key input switch <b>46</b>, the aforesaid information items are supplied to the cam coder controller <b>42</b>. The INDEX <b>35</b> generates information to be recorded to the INDEX region E<b>2</b> under control of the controller <b>42</b> so as to supply it to the time division signal distributor (SW<b>3</b>) <b>37</b>. In a case where the audio signal is recorded to the PCM region E<b>1</b>, the output from the amplifier <b>32</b> is selected by a selection circuit (omitted from illustration) by the operation of the key input switch <b>46</b>, so that the input signal to be supplied to the PCM processing circuit <b>29</b> is selectively switched to a still image information to be described later by the cam coder controller <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Since the PCM process for the 8 mm video field is a known technology, its description is omitted here for the purpose of simplifying the description.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The image signal photographed by the video camera <b>20</b> is converted into a digital image signal by the A/D converter <b>21</b>. Timing (shutter release timing) specified by the key input switch <b>46</b> or an interval pulse automatically generated is transmitted to the frame memory <b>22</b> by the cam code controller <b>42</b>, so that writing of the digital image signal to the memory <b>22</b> is inhibited at the moment writing of a desired image is completed and a still image (SV) is received. The received image can be monitored at need by operating the switch (SW<b>2</b>) <b>48</b> on an electronic view finder (EVF) <b>45</b> which usually displays kinetic image.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The still image data is supplied to the first image data compressing circuit <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the second image data compressing circuit <b>23</b><i>b </i>so as to be supplied to the mode selection circuit switch (SW<b>1</b>) <b>24</b> as three types of still image data, that is, non-compressive and raw data items (composed data items <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>). The three types of still image data items are switched by the cam coder controller <b>42</b> by the key input switch <b>46</b>. Selected image data is transmitted to the I/F <b>25</b> so as to be transmitted to the data bus <b>26</b>. On the other hand, the cam coder controller <b>42</b> transmits mode information (the difference between the non-compressed data, compressed data items <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) which has been previously selected to the sub-code data generating circuit <b>30</b>. The PCM processing circuit <b>29</b> writes it as the ID word for PCM data together with date information such as the aforesaid automatic date to the PCM region <b>1</b> together with still image data.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The aforesaid image data, which has passed through the data bus <b>26</b> and the I/F <b>26</b>, is converted into data rates of 0.5 to 1.5 Mbps by the rate converting circuit <b>28</b>, the data rates 0.5 to 1.5 Mbps being the same as that of the PCM audio data. The image data is then subjected to the PCM signal process together with the aforesaid sub-code before it is supplied to the time-division signal distributor (SW<b>3</b>) <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The time-division signal distributor (SW<b>3</b>) <b>37</b> sequentially selects PCM information, INDEX information and VIDEO information corresponding to the PCM region E<b>1</b>, the INDEX region E<b>2</b> and the VIDEO region E<b>3</b> when viewed from the head scanning direction so as to form the recording track pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The selected information is supplied to the heads <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>formed on the recording rotational drum <b>39</b> so that the track pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is formed on the tape <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Then, the process to be performed at the time of reproducing information will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An assumption is made that information track as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is formed on the tape <b>41</b>. While tracking the aforesaid track in such a manner that the capstan <b>19</b> and the rotational drum <b>39</b> are controlled by the servo circuit <b>38</b>, the recorded information signal is detected by the heads <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>formed on the rotational drum <b>39</b>. The detected signal is processed by the time-division signal distributor (SW<b>3</b>) <b>37</b> in such a manner that each information is distributed to the PCM region E<b>1</b>, the INDEX region E<b>2</b> and the VIDEO region E<b>3</b> in a time division manner and according to the contents of information.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Information (the analog signal) in the VIDEO region E<b>3</b> is divided according to the frequency spectrum by the addition distributor <b>36</b> so that the signals are supplied starting from the lower frequency spectrum in such a manner that the pilot signal 4f is supplied to the servo circuit <b>38</b>, color information c is supplied to the analog signal processing circuit <b>34</b>, audio information (AFM) is supplied to the audio processing circuit <b>38</b> and brightness information Y is, similarly to color information c, supplied to the analog signal processing circuit <b>34</b>. As a result, they are subjected to the known 8 mm video signal process. As a result, a satisfactorily tracked image and audio signal are transmitted to the output terminals <b>73</b> and <b>74</b>. The image signal can be selectively displayed at need by the switch (SW<b>2</b>) <b>48</b> by the cam coder controller <b>42</b> similarly to still image information to be described later. Another example may be employed in which an image process such as a known “picture in picture” process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Information in the INDEX region E<b>2</b> is subjected in such a manner that a data group as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is reproduced by the INDEX <b>35</b> so as to be supplied to the cam corder controller <b>42</b>. The head searching operation for the printing out process is performed by rotating the capstan at a high speed by the aforesaid servo circuit <b>38</b> until the search signal (e.g. a signal, all of data items of which are “1”) written in the INDEX region E<b>2</b>. When the servo circuit <b>38</b> detects the search signal, all of data items of which are “1”, it reads print information (information about the number of sheets and the size) set to the VIDEO region E<b>3</b> so as to transmit it to the cam coder controller <b>42</b>. The aforesaid data items are transmitted to the data bus <b>26</b> via the If <b>43</b> so as to be received by the video printer unit <b>14</b> at need.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Information in the PCM region E<b>1</b> is processed in such a manner that the still image data, which is the main data, and the ID word, which is the sub-code data,. are respectively subjected to the reproduction process by the PCM processing circuit <b>29</b>. The audio rate (0.5 m to 1.5 Mbps) of the still image data is converted in an opposite manner to that at the time of the recording operation by the rate converting circuit <b>28</b> so as to be adapted to the data rate of the data bus <b>26</b>. The audio rate is then transmitted to the data bus <b>26</b> via the I/F <b>27</b>. At this time, the still image information is transmitted to the video printer unit <b>14</b> via the data bus <b>26</b> in a state it is compressed together with compression mode information.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The cam coder controller <b>42</b> transmits the still image information for the image monitoring operation to the ensuing first and the second compressing/expanding circuits <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>via the I/F <b>25</b> and transmits the control information to the same via the I/F <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The switch (SW<b>5</b>) <b>49</b> selects non-compressed information and each information substantially expanded/restored to the original image information by the first or the second expanding process. The selection output signal from the switch (SW<b>5</b>) <b>49</b> is stored on the frame memory <b>22</b> as a still picture for one picture so as to be read out by the D/A converter <b>60</b> at the video rate. Then, it is supplied to the switch <b>48</b> as analog image information as described above. If necessary, it is displayed on the image monitor device such as an EVF <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Also the analog image signal can be printed out similarly to non-compressed data of the digital still image by converting it into digital data by the A/D converter <b>75</b> by inputting a head searching signal or the like to an arbitrary picture of the kinetic image signal so as to specify the still image.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operation of the video printer unit <b>14</b> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a case where the aforesaid digital image signal is made to be the input source, the transmitted image signal has been supplied on the data bus <b>26</b> adjacent to the video printer unit <b>14</b>. Therefore, the video printer unit <b>14</b> receives image data of the aforesaid information into the buffer memory <b>65</b> adjacent to the printer unit <b>14</b> and the printer controller <b>67</b> via the I/F <b>64</b> and receives control data to the same via the I/F <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The output from the I/F <b>64</b> is supplied to the buffer memory <b>65</b> via the data selector (SW<b>6</b>) <b>77</b>. The buffer memory <b>65</b> always transmits information about the space capacity of the buffer memory <b>65</b> to the printer controller <b>67</b> in order to enable the printer controller <b>67</b> to control the memory occupancy state due to the storage of data. The first and second expanders <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> expand image data, which have been temporarily stored, under control of the printer controller <b>67</b> in an opposite manner to that performed at the time of the recording operation. The selector (SW<b>6</b>) <b>70</b> stores expanded image data together with non-compressed data on the frame memory <b>71</b> as still image information to be reproduced. The printing unit <b>72</b> is controlled by the printer controller <b>67</b> so as to generate a video print picture by using still image information.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The aforesaid data selector (SW<b>6</b>) <b>70</b> acts in synchronization with the operation of switching the input signal by means of the key input switch <b>76</b>, so that the selection operation is properly controlled by the printer controller <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the operation is started, the servo circuit <b>38</b> in the VTR unit <b>90</b> searches the video tape <b>41</b> under control of the cam coder controller <b>42</b> (S<b>1</b>). The cam coder controller <b>42</b> confirms whether or not the head-searching signal has been detected from the INDEX region E<b>2</b> (S<b>2</b>) and causes the servo circuit <b>38</b> to continue its searching operation until the fact that all of the data items are “1” is detected in the head searching signal. If it is detected, the rotation of the capstan <b>19</b> is stopped and the flow proceeds to step S<b>3</b> on the affirmative side. In this step, the printer controller <b>67</b> requests print status “PT·ST” for confirming the operation state of the unit including the printer unit <b>14</b>. The printer controller <b>67</b> in the unit including the printer unit <b>14</b> which has received the request transmitted via the data bus <b>26</b> confirms the state of the buffer memory <b>65</b> (S<b>4</b>). The printer controller <b>67</b> receives information about the vacant capacity from the buffer memory <b>65</b> so as to confirm that the memory has been saturated (S<b>5</b>). If it has been saturated, the flow proceeds to step S<b>6</b> in which “PT·ST” is set to “Busy”. If there is a vacant capacity, “PT·ST” is set to “Free” (S<b>7</b>) and “Free·Capa” is set according to the state of occupancy of the memory (S<b>8</b>). The printer controller <b>67</b> transmits the thus set “PT·ST” information about the state of the printer unit <b>14</b> and “Free·Capa (F·C)” information about the vacant capacity of the buffer memory <b>65</b> to the data bus <b>26</b> so as to be sent to the unit including the VTR unit <b>90</b> (S<b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The cam coder controller <b>42</b> receives “PT·ST” and “F.C” (S<b>10</b>). If “PT·ST” is “Busy” (S<b>11</b>), the flow returns to said step S<b>3</b> and waits till the operation of printer unit <b>14</b> becomes idle.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The printer controller <b>67</b> confirms the quantity of still image data which corresponds to the head searching signal found in step S<b>2</b> if there is a vacant capacity in the buffer memory <b>65</b> because “PT·ST”=“Free”, the confirmed data quantity being then set to D·C (data capacity) (S<b>12</b>). The printer controller <b>67</b> reads out information about information about the type of the photography and the compression mode and it may specified as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> or it may describe the capacity in the sub-code as the number of bits.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, the printer controller <b>67</b> makes comparisons between D.C and F.C, that is, the vacant capacity of the buffer memory <b>65</b> in the printer unit <b>14</b> and the quantity of image data to be transmitted from the VTR unit <b>90</b> (S<b>13</b>). If the memory in the printer unit <b>14</b> does not have a satisfactorily large capacity, the flow returns to step S<b>3</b> in which the generation of a vacant capacity in the buffer memory <b>65</b> is waited for. If an affirmative discrimination is made, image data confirmed in step <b>812</b> is reproduced (S<b>14</b>) and image data items are sequentially transmitted to the data bus <b>26</b> (S<b>15</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The printer controller <b>67</b> receives image data via the I/F <b>64</b> (S<b>16</b>) and writes image data to the buffer memory <b>65</b> (S<b>17</b>). Then, the printer controller <b>67</b> checks data transference (S<b>18</b>) and notifies the VTR portion <b>90</b> via the bus line <b>26</b> that the completion of the operation of writing image data to the buffer memory <b>65</b> if the checking operation has been completed. When the cam coder controller <b>42</b> discriminates the completion of the data transference operation from the notified fact (S<b>20</b>), it confirms the existence/presence of the instruction to search the next head searching signal. If there is a left “JOB”, the flow returns to step S<b>1</b> for the searching operation and this operation is performed. If a discrimination of “END of JOB” is made, the flow proceeds to the affirmative side and the process is completed here.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The operation of the video printer unit <b>14</b> will now be described with reference to an operation flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The printer controller <b>67</b> properly expands still image data (expressed as “SV” in the flow chart) supplied from the buffer memory <b>65</b> and receives it after the printer controller <b>67</b> has developed still image data on the frame memory <b>71</b> (S<b>60</b>). The printer side controller <b>67</b> receives data about the printing out conditions and the like (the size of the print and the number of prints) (S<b>61</b>). Then, the printer controller <b>67</b> resets a print sheet number counter N to “0” (S<b>62</b>). The printer side controller <b>67</b> sets the number of the prints received in step S<b>61</b> to P (S<b>63</b>). Then, the printing operation is commenced and printing of one sheet is printed before the flow proceeds to next step (S<b>64</b>). Then, the count of the counter N is increased by one (S<b>65</b>), and then whether or not the number N of the printed sheets has reached required number P is discriminated (S<b>66</b>). If a negative discrimination is made, the flow returns to step S<b>64</b> in which the printing out operation is continued. If an affirmative discrimination is made, the flow proceeds to step S<b>66</b>. The original data (compressed data) of still image data is deleted from the buffer memory <b>65</b> after the printing out operation has been completed (S<b>67</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">After the deletion in the step S<b>67</b>, it is discriminated whether still image data to be printed still remain or not (S<b>68</b>).

<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates examples of modes which can be set by combining the methods of compressing/expanding image data and the image pickup methods. As the image pickup methods, the field and the frame of an NTSC (or PAL) field photographing method and those of a so-called high-vision TV which has doubled frame photographs and the number of scanning lines are set. As the compressing method, a space thinning sub-sample, or a quantizing operation DPCM, or a block coding orthogonal conversion DCT, or a JPEG, or the like can be utilized. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an example of the aforesaid combinations expressed as 4-bit modes <b>1</b> to <b>16</b> as the modes.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As described above, data for several to several tens still image can be stored in one buffer memory <b>65</b> according to the mode.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to the aforesaid embodiment, an example is described in which the buffer memory <b>65</b> is commonly used as the buffer memory for processing the digital signal and the frame memory for processing the analog signal. However, it can be used as a field memory in place of the frame memory.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to the aforesaid embodiment, when image data is transferred from the VTR unit <b>90</b> to the printer unit <b>14</b>, the operation state of the printer unit <b>14</b> can be confirmed and the searching operation to be performed by the VTR unit <b>90</b> can be controlled according to the state of the printer. Therefore, by previously recording print retrieval information on the video tape <b>41</b>, a video printer system capable of performing an automatic printing process by sequentially searching plural types of pictures (immediately after the printing operation has been completed) can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As described above, the complicated printing process which takes a lot of time can be automated and therefore the home video printing culture can be widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Furthermore, in a case where a development to an external printing laboratory is made in the present photograph DPE system, the automation of the printing process will realize an advantage. Therefore, a novel electronic photography DPE culture can be created in which a video tape, to which printing out information has been inputted, is brought to a printer service shop capable of printing a higher image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Since the data transference to the buffer memory <b>65</b> in the printer unit <b>14</b> is performed in a compression state, the data transference speed can be raised, the number of pictures which can be stored in the buffer memory <b>65</b> can be increased and delay of the operation due to the busy state generated in the operation of the printer unit <b>14</b> cannot be easily generated. Therefore, the overall operation time can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Since two picture sources, that is, the analog input and the digital input are provided, a variety of input signals can be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to this embodiment, the memories required for each input section is constituted by the same memory and it is switched to the buffer memory and the frame memory or the field memory in synchronization with the selection of the input signal. Therefore, the size of the circuit can be made to be compact. Furthermore, the memory capacity of the analog signal section can be used by the digital signal section, causing design freedom to be realized. Therefore, the aforesaid problem of time loss due to the delay of the searching operation in the VTR unit <b>90</b> caused from the “printer-busy”, that is, the full-operation of the buffer memory cannot easily take place. As a result, an effect can be obtained in that the overall printing time can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As described above, according to this embodiment, the buffer memory and the frame memory or the field memory are made of the common memory and the common memory is selectively used as the buffer memory and the frame memory or the field memory according to the state of selection of the first input means for receiving the digital signal or the second input means for receiving the analog signal. Therefore, a video printing system can be provided which is capable of satisfactorily shortening the time taken for the user even if a plurality of pictures are printed out, with which the printing operation can be automated, the overall cost of which can be reduced and the structure of the circuit of which can be simplified and made to be compact.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an image picture formed in a case where a partial printing is specified by using the index counter.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Assuming that the index counter is set to N=3 with respect to the process start point PS, the tape is sent in the forward direction until the index number <b>3</b> is detected. At this time, the tape sending operation is stopped at the end point PE. If N is set to a negative number, the tape sending is started in the opposite direction from the start point PS and therefore the index searching operation is started in the opposite direction. The process is completed when the determined number is realized similarly to the forward direction. Actually, the same index information is continuously recorded for about 10 seconds, that is, about 600 tracks converted, the configuration becomes different from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">According to the automatic printing out process as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a partial image printing can be automatically performed. Therefore, addition of printing out can be enabled if necessary and therefore the use can be varied. As a result, a convenient video printing system can be constituted.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Another example of automating the printing out process having the first full mode and the second part mode similarly to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> will now be described with reference to a flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to this example, the first mode is made to be a full mode for collectively automatically printing all information on a video cassette and the second mode is made to be part mode for automatically partially printing information while specifying the image pickup period.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">First, in step S<b>90</b>, period specification start variable T<b>1</b>, completion variable T<b>2</b> and a reverse flag Rv are provided and each of them is reset to zero. In next step S<b>91</b>, branching to the first full mode and the second part mode is performed according to the mode which has been set. In the case of the full mode, rewinding to the tape head is performed in step S<b>92</b>, and then the flow proceeds to step S<b>94</b>. In the case of the part mode, the subject periods T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are set by the key input operation performed by a user with the key switch <b>76</b> or <b>46</b>. Then, the flow proceeds to step S<b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In step S<b>94</b>, the forward directional index search is performed. Then, in step S<b>95</b>, a completion discrimination whether or not searching has reached the tape end is made in step S<b>95</b>. In step S<b>96</b>, whether or not the index has been detected is discriminated and a loop arranged as S<b>94</b>→S<b>95</b>→S<b>96</b>→S<b>94</b> is repeated until it is detected. If it is detected, the flow proceeds to step S<b>97</b>. In step S<b>97</b>, a time code (data and time of the photography and the like), print information (the number of sheets or the size or the like) and still image information are read from the tape.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In next step S<b>98</b>, time code “DATE” read in the previous step S<b>97</b> is subjected to a comparison with variables T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> so as to confirm whether or not it is information within the subject period for the printing out operation. If T<b>1</b>≦DATE or T<b>2</b>≧DATE, an affirmative discrimination is made. Therefore, the data transference is performed in step S<b>99</b> because it is within the subject period. That is, still image information and the like are transmitted to the data bus <b>2</b>. If T<b>1</b>&gt;DATE or T<b>2</b>&lt;DATE, a negative discrimination is made. Therefore, a fact that the reversing of the searching direction has not been performed is confirmed in step S<b>100</b>, and then the searching direction is reversed in step S<b>101</b>. Then, the reverse flag Rv is set to “1” in step S<b>102</b> and the flow returns to step S<b>94</b> in which searching is performed. However, in the case where the reverse searching has been started, the process is completed at the moment Rv=1 is detected in step S<b>100</b> in order to avoid repeated searching of the same tape.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an image picture formed in a case where the time code and the search code are written to the index region.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A unit designated by diagonal lines is a unit to which the search code is written and date entered below it corresponds to the date of the photography. Although, the distance between the marks (CP) is positioned away from each other by several hundred times actually, DATE is written in the time sequential manner. For example, assumptions are made that T<b>1</b>=Jan. 1, 1991 and T<b>2</b>=Jan. 31, 1991, it can be understood that the subject period for the printing output operation defined by T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are two pictures on Jan. 1, 1991 and Jan. 15, 1991. In the aforesaid case in which only specific pictures photographed in January 1991 are desired to be printed, it can be performed by the aforesaid printing out process.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">According to the aforesaid automatic printing process as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, partial printing of the cassette can be automatically performed by specifying the range by a retrieval means which can be easily handled by the human sensitivity. Therefore, a video printing system which can be easily handled can be constituted.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described above, according to this embodiment of the present invention, in a case where image data is transferred from the VTR to the printer, the operation state of the printer is confirmed, and then the VTR searching operation is controlled according to the operation state. Therefore, by previously recording print data to the video tape, a plurality of pictures can be sequentially searched and the printing out operation can be automatically performed immediately after the printing operation has been completed. As described above, the non-efficient printing work, which has taken a too long time according to the conventional technology can be automated. Therefore, the home video printing culture can be promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Furthermore, in a case where a development to an external printing laboratory is made in the present photograph DPE system, a novel electronic photography DPE culture can be created in which a video tape, to which printing out information has been inputted, is brought to a printer service shop capable of printing a higher image quality because the automatic printing can be enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Since data is transferred to the printer side buffer memory in a compressed state, the data transference speed can be raised and therefore the number of pictures which can be stored in the memory can be increased. Therefore, the delay of the work due to the Busy state generated during the operation of the printer can be prevented satisfactorily and the time taken to complete the process can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As described above, according to this embodiment, the structure comprises detection means for detecting an index signal recorded to a recording medium together with an image signal and acting to specify a picture to be printed, setting means for setting conditions for retrieving the picture to be printed, extracting means for extracting the index signal which corresponds to the set retrieval condition and printing means for printing only a specified picture in response to the extracted index signal. Therefore, in a case where a plurality of pictures are desired to be printed, head searching can be automatically performed by only performing the initialization by a user. Therefore, only a desired picture can be automatically printed and therefore the efficiency of the operation of printing a part of a recording medium can be significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">According to the aforesaid embodiment, the results of rough estimation of the data quantity which corresponds to the aforesaid modes <b>1</b> to <b>16</b> and the number to be stored in the memory are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> while making the non-compressed information about the HD frame picture to be a reference and assuming a buffer memory capable of storing only one picture. As described above, it can be understood that data about several to tens of still images can be stored in one buffer memory <b>65</b> according to the mode. A specific example of the storage capacity of the buffer memory <b>65</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 17</figref> while assuming that the storage capacity of the buffer memory <b>65</b> to be data about one picture which is not compressed.

At this time, the system controller <b>401</b> of the VTR <b>211</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> controls each unit of the apparatus according to control information supplied from the control unit <b>521</b> via the I/F <b>520</b> and <b>301</b>. For example, the system controller <b>401</b> controls the capstan motor <b>403</b> and the drum motor <b>404</b> via the servo circuit <b>402</b> and as well controls the switches <b>429</b>, <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>and <b>414</b> via the selection signal generator <b>425</b>. The reproducing speed can, of course, be arbitrarily changed by the aforesaid dial <b>505</b> and the pause key <b>503</b> in this reproduction mode. The aforesaid change can be realized by changing the rotational speed of the capstan motor <b>203</b>. Furthermore, the relative speed between heads Ha and Hb and the tape T can be maintained at a constant speed by changing the rotational speed of the drum motor <b>404</b>. Furthermore, the difference in the inclination between the trace locus of the head and the track is always absorbed by the head moving mechanisms Ma and Mb.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0180">In the aforesaid reproducing mode, reproduction video signals supplied from the recording/reproducing heads Ha and Hb disposed on the drum <b>206</b> are made to a continuous signal via PB terminals of the switches <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b, </i>the amplifiers <b>213</b><i>a </i>and <b>213</b><i>b </i>and the switch <b>214</b> before it is supplied to the video reproducting signal processing circuit <b>218</b>. The video signal supplied from the signal processing circuit <b>218</b> is transmitted to the monitor <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> via the PB side of the switch <b>420</b> and the N side of the switch <b>429</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0181">On the other hand, digital data reproduced by the audio area AA and the data area PA is converted into an analog signal by the D/A <b>230</b> via the switch <b>214</b>, the switch <b>215</b>, which is usually always closed, the code data decoder <b>219</b> before it is transmitted. In a case of still image data, it is temporarily stored in the image memory <b>217</b> via the SV side terminal of the switch <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0182">The operator retrieves a desired picture by operating a dial <b>305</b> or the like while confirming a picture transmitted from the monitor <b>202</b>. At the time at which the desired picture is displayed, the operator operates the pause key <b>503</b> so as to bring the VTR <b>11</b> into the still image reproducing mode. When a print specifying button <b>504</b> is operated in this state, this information is transmitted from the key operation unit <b>521</b> to the system controller <b>401</b> via the system controller <b>232</b> and the I/F <b>520</b> and <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0183">The aforesaid operation corresponds to step <b>1</b> of a flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0184">Then, the flow proceeds to step <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> in which the size of the print is specified with the operation unit <b>521</b>. The operation unit <b>521</b> is used to specify the image quality (step <b>3</b>), the number of prints (step <b>4</b>) and the sort (step <b>5</b>). The aforesaid steps <b>2</b> to <b>4</b> are respectively set for each print size. Whether or not there is another print size is specified with the operation unit <b>521</b> in step <b>6</b>. If it is present, the flow returns to step <b>2</b>. If it is not present, the flow proceeds to step <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0185">In step <b>7</b>, data (hereinafter called “print data”) generated in the aforesaid steps <b>2</b> to <b>5</b> is transferred to the system controller <b>401</b> via the I/F <b>520</b> and <b>301</b> and is generated by the print generator <b>424</b>. In step <b>8</b>, the aforesaid print data is transmitted to the code data encoder <b>208</b> and is also transmitted to the display signal generator <b>422</b>. At this time, a reproduction video signal transmitted via the switch <b>420</b> and the output signal from the display signal generator <b>422</b> which corresponds to the aforesaid print data are mixed with each other by the adder <b>426</b>. A video signal which corresponds to the picture formed by multiplying an image to be printed and a character showing print data is digitized by the A/D converter <b>427</b>. The output from the A/D converter <b>427</b> is supplied to the image memory <b>417</b>. At this time, the print data generator <b>424</b> receives video signal for one frame from the A/D converter <b>427</b> in accordance with an instruction made by the memory control circuit <b>416</b> and repeats the aforesaid operation. As a result, the video signal supplied from the image memory <b>417</b> is converted into an analog signal by the D/A converter <b>423</b> before it is transmitted to the monitor <b>202</b> via the S side of the switch <b>429</b> (step <b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0186">Then, the operator confirms the picture to be printed and print data while observing the picture displayed on the monitor <b>202</b> so as to check whether or not the contents of the picture are the contents of the desired picture (step <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0187">If the contents are different from those of the desired picture, the flow returns to step <b>1</b> and the operation is again started. If the contents are those of the desired picture, the flow proceeds to step <b>11</b> in which the aforesaid print data is recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0188">Then, recording of the aforesaid print data will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0189">Usually, if the VTR shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is in the recording mode, the state of the video signal received by the video recording signal processing circuit <b>407</b> is discriminated to be suitable to be recorded and therefore the video signal is supplied to the switch <b>410</b>. On the other hand, the audio signal digitized by the AID converter <b>430</b> or the digitized still image data is read out from the memory <b>417</b> after its data rate has been lowered. Then, the switch <b>450</b> acts to select the AUD terminal in the case of the audio signal or the SV terminal in the case of the still image. The code data encoder <b>408</b> encodes it before it is supplied to the switch <b>410</b> via the switch <b>409</b> which is always closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> schematically illustrates the rotational phase of the heads Ha and Hb and the trace position on the tape T. The switch <b>410</b> causes the video recording signal processing circuit <b>407</b> to be connected to the amplifiers <b>411</b><i>a </i>and <b>411</b><i>b </i>in a period in which the heads Ha and Hb trace the video area VA. On the other hand, it causes the code data encoder <b>408</b> to be connected to the amplifiers <b>411</b><i>a </i>and <b>411</b><i>b </i>in a period in which the heads Ha and Hb trace the audio area AA.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0190">In a case where print data is recorded according to step <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the switch <b>409</b> is controlled in response to a signal C<b>3</b> supplied to the selection signal generator <b>425</b> in such a manner that it is switched on in only a period in which the print data area PA is traced by the heads Ha and Hb, the print data area PA corresponding to the postamble unit of the audio-area AA and a unit of the guard region. Furthermore, the switches <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>are connected to the REC side in only the aforesaid period in response to the signal C<b>1</b>. As a result, print data encoded by the code encoder <b>208</b> can be recorded to the print data area PA on the tape T. That is, if a discrimination is made in step <b>10</b> that the contents of the print picture and print data are as desired, print data is recorded to the print data area PA of the track to which the video signal, which is being reproduced, has been recorded in step <b>11</b>. That is, print data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is recorded to the print data recording area PA of the track to which the print specifying picture is recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0191">Then, the system controller <b>401</b> rotates the capstan motor <b>403</b> at the same speed as the normal recording speed so that the head searching signal is recorded to the aforesaid header unit for 10 seconds. Usually, a 2.9 MHz carrier signal is recorded to the header unit and a 5.8 MHz carrier signal is recorded to the unit which corresponds to the aforesaid 10 seconds. The 1 bit showing whether or not the parent picture of the 0-th bit of the aforesaid word WD<b>0</b> reproduces the head searching signal in step <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. If it is 5.8 MHz, “1” is automatically set.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0192">An operation of printing the print specifying picture from the tape, to which the print specifying picture is set, will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0193">When the tape, to which the print specifying picture has been set, is first loaded in the VTR <b>211</b> and a print command is issued with the key operation unit <b>321</b>, the system controller <b>410</b> rotates the capstan motor <b>403</b> and the drum motor <b>404</b> via the servo circuit <b>402</b>. As a result, the signal transmitted from the aforesaid print data area PA. is reproduced while winding the tape T at high speed. At this time, the switches <b>412</b><i>a </i>and <b>412</b><i>b </i>are connected to the PB side, while the switch <b>414</b> causes the amplifiers <b>413</b><i>a </i>and <b>413</b><i>b </i>to be connected to the code data decoder side. The switch <b>415</b> is switched on at the timing at which the heads Ha and Hb trace the print data area PA, and the code data decoder <b>419</b> transmits “1” as the head searching control signal when the aforesaid head unit reproduction signal is 5.8 MHz. In response to the fact that the head searching control signal has become “1”, the system controller <b>401</b> controls the capstan motor <b>403</b> in such a manner that the tape is run in the opposite direction to the direction at the time of the recording operation at the same speed as that at the time of the recording-operation.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0194">In this state, the code data decoder <b>419</b> reproduces data supplied from the data unit. If all of the 4-bit data of data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> showing the number of prints are not zero, the system controller <b>401</b> stops running of the tape T. At this time, either of a mode in which running of the tape T is stopped in only a period in which non-printed data is being detected or a mode in which running of the tape T is stopped regardless of whether or not the data has been printed may be set.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0195">The heads Ma and Mb of the head moving mechanism trace the track to which the specified pictures have been recorded in the state where the tape T is stopped. The reproduction signal at this time is received by the image memory <b>417</b> via the video reproducing signal processing circuit <b>418</b>, the adder <b>426</b> and the A/D converter <b>427</b>. Print data is, via the code data decoder <b>419</b>, received by the printer control signal generator <b>421</b> acting as an interface. When the aforesaid receiving operation has been completed, data stored in the image memory <b>417</b> and printer control data transmitted from the printer control signal generator <b>421</b> are transferred to the printer data bus <b>428</b>. The printer <b>203</b> prints video data supplied via the data bus <b>228</b> according to the control data. When the printing operation is completed, the printer <b>203</b> transmits data showing the completion of the printing operation to the data bus <b>428</b>. The print completion data supplied from the printer <b>203</b> is transmitted to the system controller <b>401</b> via the printer control signal generator. In accordance with this, the VTR performs the next operation.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0196">That is, when the print completion data is supplied to the VTR, rewriting of print data to “0” is performed if the first bit of the word WD<b>0</b> is “1”. Since the operation of the VTR at this time is the same as that to be performed at the time of recording print data, its description is omitted here. Then, retrieval of the next specified picture is performed in such a manner that, in a case where the parent picture is present, the flow starts at the step in which the tape is run at the same speed as that at the time of the recording operation in the opposite direction. In a case where it is not present, the flow starts at the step in which the tape is run at a high speed in the forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0197">Then, an example of application of the print to be transmitted from the system according to this embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 to 28</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> illustrate examples of an equal-magnification printing operation, wherein the aforesaid print data of WD<b>0</b> to WD<b>4</b> is recorded in the form of a bar code in the lower left unit of the print. If the sensor unit <b>522</b> of the printer <b>203</b> has the bar code reading function, the original video signal can be retrieved on the tape T from this print. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates a multiple picture to be printed out in a case where all of data about the number of prints of WD<b>1</b> to WD<b>4</b> are “1”. The address of the picture such as the time code on the tape is printed in the lower right unit of the contracted picture. If the VTR has a function of retrieving the tape T by using the time code, the original video signal on the tape T can be retrieved similarly.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0198">In the system including the VTR thus constituted, each print picture can be automatically printed after all of the pictures to be printed have been selected. Therefore, the handling facility of the system of this type can be significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0199">Furthermore, a picture, which has been once printed, can be again printed by reproducing print data on the tape.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0200">In addition, if the retrieving marks for head-searching are added to a predetermined number of pictures adjacent to the print specified picture, the tape can be run at high speed at the time of retrieving the print specified picture.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0201">Since the frame No. from the start position of the tape can be recorded to the time code in the aforesaid WD<b>0</b> to WD<b>4</b>, the video signal on the tape T and the recording unit of the PCM-SV can be easily retrieved by using the aforesaid information. If the additional information such as date is not required, it can be omitted by switching off the switch <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0202">As described above, the structure according to this embodiment comprises an image signal reproducing unit having an image signal reproducing device and a first digital interface unit for transmitting the reproduction image signal supplied from the reproducing device as digital data, an operation member for retrieving the picture of the reproducing device, a second digital interface unit for supplying control data generated by the operation member to the reproducing device and a printer capable of printing the reproduction image signal supplied from the reproducing device, wherein the operation member is disposed in the printer unit. Therefore, a variety of operations from the printer side can be performed. As a result, searching can be satisfactorily performed even if an exclusive retrieving (switch or the like) member is not provided in the VTR unit. It is significantly effective in a case where it is employed in a camera integrated VTR the size of which has been reduced recently. Furthermore, since the digital interface unit is provided for both the VTR unit and the printer unit, a complicated wiring can be omitted and the connector for connecting the VTR and the printer can be reduced in size and simplified. Therefore, a further satisfactory effect can be obtained in a case where it is employed in a camera integrated VTR.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0203">In addition, the two digital interfaces are connected by means of a sole data bus. Therefore, the wiring can be further simpilfied and the size of the camera integrated VTR can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0204">As described above, according to the present invention, a quick retrieving operation can be performed and the operation facility of the video print system can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0205">Although a tape-like medium is used according to the aforesaid embodiment, a disc like medium or another shape, such as a solid memory can employed. In addition, a TV signal is employed as the video signal, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, a still image such as an electronic file may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0206">The printing means according to this embodiment may be an electronic photography method, a thermal printer and an ink jet method called a “bubble jet method”.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0207">Although a tape-like medium is used according to the aforesaid embodiment, a disc like medium or another shape, such as a solid memory can employed. In addition, although a TV signal is employed as the video signal, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, a still image such as an electronic file may be employed.</p>
