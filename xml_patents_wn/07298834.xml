<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to conferencing systems. More specifically, it relates to a system and method for creating a large capacity conferencing system using multiple media mixers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern businesses increasingly use conferencing systems for enabling telecommunications between people around the world. Conference calls involving three or more people are common today, and as the global economy continues to expand, the importance of conferencing systems is expected to grow.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Present conferencing systems often use a media mixer to multiplex audio and/or video data streams into mixed streams that are dispatched to conference participants. Media mixers are typically physical or logical devices having a capacity limitation that restricts the total number of conference participants that can be handled. Thus, the total number of conference participants within a conferencing system is typically limited by the capacity of the media mixer being utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art methods for increasing the call capacity of a conferencing system have included increasing the physical capacity of a media mixer and/or adding a logical control device that can combine media mixers at a physical layer into a larger logical entity. However, both of these methods typically require substantial redesign of a media mixer by a vendor at a relatively high cost. Furthermore, these methods generally create a conferencing system with a static call capacity that a user is unable to change.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to have a conferencing system that overcomes the above deficiencies associated with the prior art by utilizing multiple mixers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system and method for teleconferencing using multiple media mixers is provided. An exemplary conferencing system may include one central media mixer (CMM), one or multiple edge media mixers (EMM), and a conference control server in communication with the CMM and the EMMs. The conference control server may create a media path between the CMM and the EMMs, and the media path may be created using a call-control protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect of the present embodiment, a method for connecting a conference participant to a conference may include receiving a connection request to the conference from the conference participant. Additionally, the method may include determining a CMM and an EMM for the conference. The method may also include connecting the conference participant with the EMM via a call-control protocol, and connecting the EMM with the CMM via the call-control protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another aspect of the present embodiment, a conference control server for use in a teleconferencing system may include a processing unit and a storage unit. The conference control server may use the processing unit to create a first media path between a conference participant and an EMM. Additionally, the conference control server may use the processing unit to create a second media path between the EMM and a CMM.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">1. Exemplary Conference Call</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an exemplary conferencing system, conference participants may communicate with one another via a communication mechanism such as audio or video. The conferencing system may include a conference control server for managing the conference(s) taking place. The conferencing system may also include multiple media mixers that are controlled by the conference control server though call signaling paths. The media mixers may have media ports for connecting with one another and with the conference participants.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an exemplary audio conference, a first conference participant may call a predetermined telephone number to initiate the conference. The conference control server may receive the call and chose one of the media mixers as a central media mixer (CMM) for the conference. Additionally, the conference control server may chose another media mixer as an edge media mixer (EMM), and the conference control server may setup a duplex media path between the EMM and the CMM via a call-control protocol, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISUP), or Q.931 signaling. For more information on SIP, one can refer to Request for Comments (RFC) 3261, “SIP: Session Initiation Protocol”, the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Once the media path between the EMM and the CMM is setup, the conference control server may forward the connection from the first conference participant to the EMM. As additional participants join the conference, the conference control server may forward the participants' connections to the EMM to enable the participants to communicate with one another. In an alternate embodiment, the conference control server may first connect conference participants to the CMM until almost all of its media ports are being used. At this point, the conference control server may choose an EMM and create a multi-mixer conference by setting up a duplex media path between the EMM and the CMM.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">If the number of participants within the conference grows and exceeds the capacity of the EMM, the conference control server may designate a second EMM from available media mixers within the conferencing system. As with the EMM, the conference control server may setup a media path between the second EMM and the CMM via a standard call-control protocol. Once the media path between the second EMM and the CMM is setup, the conference control server may allocate new conference participants to the second EMM.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The exemplary arrangements within the present application may include a number of advantages. For example, the present conferencing systems may increase the potential call capacity of a conference (e.g., the number of potential conference participants) by linking multiple EMMs to a CMM. Furthermore, these conferencing systems may have a dynamic call capacity that an administrator of the conferencing system may change depending on factors such as expected call volume, types of conferences in session, and so forth. Additionally, the present embodiments may utilize a standard, high-level call-control protocol (e.g., SIP) to multiplex multiple media mixers together, without requiring structural change to the conferencing system and without changing other protocols being used.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, the present embodiments may have the advantage of preventing media path loops (e.g., loops that begin and end at the same media mixer) and potential long delays through the use of a star topology. Furthermore, the present embodiments may enable an administrator of a conferencing system to connect various conference participants to different EMMs, so that if a single EMM fails, most connections will still remain intact. Thus, the present embodiments may be less susceptible to mixer failure and thus, be more reliable. Additionally, by shifting intelligence away from the media mixer to the conference control server, the present embodiments may enable the use of simpler and cheaper media mixers while also allowing an administrator to use the conference control server to centrally control conferences.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">II. Exemplary Conferencing System</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram overview of an exemplary conferencing system <b>100</b>. The conferencing system <b>100</b> includes a conference control server <b>120</b> that communicates with a CMM <b>130</b>, a first EMM <b>140</b>, a second EMM <b>150</b>, and a third EMM <b>160</b> via call signaling paths. The conference control server <b>120</b> may also communicate with conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> via call signaling paths as well. For ease of reference and sake of clarity, the call signaling paths between the conference control server <b>120</b> and the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> are not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It should be understood, however, that such call signaling paths are preferably present in the exemplary conference system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> communicate with the CMM <b>130</b> via media paths. Conference participants <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may in turn communicate with the CMM <b>130</b> via the first EMM <b>140</b>, and conference participant <b>106</b> may in turn communicate with the CMM <b>130</b> via the second EMM <b>150</b>. Furthermore, conference participant <b>108</b> may be in direct communication with the CMM <b>130</b>, and another conference participant <b>110</b> may communicate with the CMM <b>130</b> via the third EMM <b>160</b>. It should be understood that any number of conference control servers, media mixers, and conference participants may connect in any fashion within the present conferencing system <b>100</b>. Additionally, for more information on telecommunications conferencing, one can refer to the commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,262,979, the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">A. Exemplary Conference Participants</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an exemplary embodiment, the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may be telephones (e.g., mobile telephones, wireline telephones), computers, portable electronic devices (e.g., personal digital assistants (PDAs)), or other such telecommunications devices capable of connecting to the conference control server <b>120</b> in response to a user action (e.g., dialing the telephone number for the conference control server <b>120</b>). Additionally, as will be described later in an exemplary embodiment, the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may also communicate with one another via the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b>, and/or the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b> may utilize any number of connection mechanisms, such as dial-up (modem), wireless, Ethernet, digital subscriber line (DSL), and cable connection mechanisms. Furthermore, these devices may also employ any number of tunneling mechanisms (e.g., Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)). Also, communications between the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b>, and/or the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b> may involve any number of different call-control protocols, such as SIP, H.323, ISUP signaling, and Q.931</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">1. Exemplary Input Device</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an exemplary embodiment, each of the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may include an input device (e.g., microphone) for receiving audio information from a user and converting the audio information into electrical data signals. Alternatively, the input device may receive other types of sensory information (e.g., video, tactile-based signals), or no sensory information might be received.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">2. Exemplary I/O Device</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, each of the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may include input/output (I/O) devices for electrically sending and receiving data with the conference control server <b>120</b> and/or the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>. For example, the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may send connection requests to the conference control server <b>120</b> when connecting to a conference. The connection requests may include various types of identification information, such as a personal identification number (PIN), username, password, and/or name of the conference. The conference control server <b>120</b> may use the connection requests to authenticate the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b>, or alternatively, forward the connection requests to an authentication server (not shown) for authenticating the participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may use their I/O devices to send data signals to one another via the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>. The data signals may include, for example, the sensory information received from the input devices (e.g., audio). Additionally, the data signals may be multiplexed together so that, for example, a conference participant (e.g., conference participant <b>102</b>) may simultaneously receive data signals from any number of the other conference participants (e.g., conference participants <b>104</b>-<b>110</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">3. Exemplary Packet Controller</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, each of the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may also include a packet controller for generating packets (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and/or Universal Datagram Protocol (UDP)/IP packets) corresponding to the connection requests and/or the data signals. Additionally, the packet controller may forward the generated packets to the I/O device for transmission to the conference control server <b>120</b> and/or the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>. The packet controller may also combine packets received by the I/O device for producing multiplexed audio signals. Additionally, the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may send and/or receive unicast and/or multi-cast packets with any device in the conferencing system <b>100</b>. Although the present embodiments describe exemplary packet-based communications involving the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b>, it should be understood that non-packet-based communications (e.g., circuit switching) may additionally or alternatively be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should also be understood that the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may include more or fewer components in alternate embodiments, and that the functionality of the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> may be distributed to other components within the conferencing system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">B. Exemplary Conference Control Server</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The conference control server <b>120</b> may include any type of server or media control unit that can communicate with the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> and the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>. In the present embodiment, the conference control server <b>120</b> may be responsible for media path setup and teardown between the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> and/or the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The exemplary conference control server <b>120</b> may include a processing unit and a storage unit, as well as interfaces for communicating with the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> and media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>. In the present embodiment, the conference control server <b>120</b> may be an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) server, such as the CommWorks 8251 IVR server, which is commercially available from the assignee of the present application, 3COM Corporation. It should be understood that the conference control server <b>120</b> specified here is meant to illustrate, not limit, the present embodiment, and that the conference control server <b>120</b> may be a different type of server or computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processing unit within the exemplary conference control server <b>120</b> may include any type of processing mechanism, such as a central processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor fabricated on a silicon chip. The storage unit may include any type of storage mechanism, such as a static read-only memory (SRAM), dynamic read-only memory (DRAM), buffer, magnetic hard disk drive, or optical memory. In an exemplary embodiment, the storage unit may include a relational database that matches, for example, a username to a password and/or a conference name. In this regard, a conference participant may provide identification information to the conference control server <b>120</b>, and the conference control server <b>120</b> may use the relational database to identify which conference the participant should connect to and/or whether the participant should be authorized to access that conference. Alternatively, the conference control server <b>120</b> may send the identification information to an authentication server (not shown) that includes the storage unit and performs this authentication functionality.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">1. Exemplary Determination of CMM and EMMs</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, the conference control server <b>120</b> may determine the CMM and EMMs that are used for a conference. In an exemplary scenario, the conference control server <b>120</b> may arbitrarily determine which media mixer should be the CMM and/or EMM, such as through a random or pseudorandom selection (e.g., by sampling a system clock used by the processing unit).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternate embodiment, the conference control server <b>120</b> may use various characteristics of media mixers within the conferencing system <b>100</b> to determine the CMM and/or EMM. To illustrate, in an exemplary scenario, the conference control server <b>120</b> may determine an available call capacity for each of the media mixers within the conferencing system <b>100</b>. The available call capacity for a mixer may be defined as the number of additional calls that the mixer can handle. Thus, the available call capacity for a media mixer may be determined by subtracting its currently-used call capacity (e.g., current number of media ports in use) from its maximum call capacity (e.g., total number of usable media ports). The currently-used call capacity may be determined through registration messages sent back from the media mixers. The registration messages may be sent, for example, at regular time intervals, or after the status of the currently-used capacity has changed (e.g., the usage of a media mixer has changed by a certain percentage, or the number of people using the media mixer has changed by a certain amount). The maximum call capacity of the media mixers may be determined, for instance, by querying a database within the conference control server <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Continuing with this exemplary scenario, the CMM can be chosen as the media mixer that has the largest available call capacity (e.g., the largest difference between the maximum call capacity and the currently-used call capacity). Similarly, the EMM may be chosen as the media mixer having the second largest available call capacity. Of course, it should be understood that any media mixer having free media ports may be chosen for the CMM and/or the EMM, and that any criteria may be applied when decided which media mixers to employ. To illustrate, in an exemplary scenario, the conference control server <b>120</b> may choose any media mixer that has available media ports as the CMM.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">2. Exemplary Distribution of Conference Participants Across Different EMMs</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, in another exemplary scenario, the conference control server <b>120</b> may limit the risk of media mixer failure by distributing conference participants across multiple EMMs. To illustrate, in the exemplary conferencing system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the five (5) conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> are connecting to four (4) different media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>. Thus, if one of the EMMs fails (e.g., EMM <b>150</b>), only one or two conference participants (e.g., conference participant <b>106</b>) may be disconnected from the CMM <b>130</b>, while the other conference participants (e.g., conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> and <b>108</b>-<b>110</b>) and EMMs (e.g., EMMs <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>) maintain their connections with the CMM <b>130</b>. In such a scenario, a conference may proceed in a relatively uninterrupted fashion, since the failure of a single EMM may result in the loss of at most a few participants. Accordingly, such a configuration may provide for a more reliable way to conduct conference calls.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">3. Exemplary Conference Priorities</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, the conference control server <b>120</b> may use priority levels to offer different levels of service within different conferences. For example, the conference control server <b>120</b> may assign higher capacity media mixers and/or more media mixers to a high priority conference (e.g., a high-capacity conference or premium-level conference) than to a lower priority conference. Additionally, the conference control server <b>120</b> may store priority information pertaining to a conference and correlate the priority information, for example, to the identification information for the conference participants. It should be understood that any number and type of priority levels may be used with the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">4. Exemplary Additional Services</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to authenticating a new conference participant and determining a CMM and/or EMMs, the conference control server <b>120</b> may be responsible for a variety of other services, such as inviting the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> to initiate a new conference or join an ongoing conference, creating media paths (e.g., data links) between the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>, connecting the conference participants among the different media mixers, and so forth. Details concerning some of these services will be provided later during a discussion of exemplary messaging within the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">C. Exemplary Media Mixers</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The CMM <b>130</b> and the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> may each be any type of media mixing device that combines data signals (e.g., multiplexes audio data signals) received from the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b>. In the present embodiment, the CMM <b>130</b> and/or the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> may be a Voyant Readivoice server, though it should be understood that any number of other types of mixing devices may alternatively be used for the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mixing device is used for mixing multiple sources of media stream into one, after proper trans-coding/decoding, volume balancing, timing, and so on, as well as dispatching mixed media stream into multiple destinations. The mixing device preferably has powerful hardware to perform the time-critical media processing task, and a control interface through which the conference control server can send commands to instruct which media streams need to be mixed together, what the sources of the media streams are, what the destination of the media streams are, and when the mixing should start, pause and terminate.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">1. Exemplary Star Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present embodiment, the media mixers <b>130</b>-<b>160</b> are preferably arranged in a star configuration, with the CMM <b>130</b> at the center and the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> connected directly to the CMM <b>130</b>. In this star configuration, signals sent and received from the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>110</b> preferably travel through at most three media mixers. Thus, the star configuration may reduce signal delay between conference participants. Additionally, the star configuration may help prevent media path loops (e.g., loops that begin and end at the same media mixer) from occurring, since the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> preferably connect to one another via the CMM <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, the use of a star configuration may greatly increase the capacity of a conferencing system. To illustrate, if each media mixer within an exemplary conferencing system has a maximum capacity of 100 media ports, a configuration that only uses a single media mixer may only have 100 participants in a conference. However, in a star configuration, where 100 different edge media mixers connect to the 100 media ports of the central media mixer, the configuration may have a total of 100*(100−1)=9900 media ports available (i.e., the 100 EMMs each have 99 media ports available). Thus, it is evident that the star configuration can greatly increase the capacity of a conferencing system. It should also be noted that other media mixer configurations (e.g., chain, tree structure, etc.) may additionally or alternatively be employed within the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">2. Exemplary Media Paths</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present embodiment, a media mixer may treat a media path to another media mixer similar to a media path to a conference participant. Thus, for example, the CMM <b>130</b> may treat data received from the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> similar to data received from the conference participant <b>108</b>. Likewise, the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> may treat data received from the CMM <b>130</b> similar to data received from the conference participants <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>, <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further in the present embodiment, even as additional conference participants connect to the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b>, additional media paths between the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> and the CMM <b>130</b> are not required to be created. Thus, the additional conference participants may share the same existing media paths that connect the EMMs <b>140</b>-<b>160</b> to the CMM <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">3. Exemplary Multiple Conferences</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, it should be understood that multiple different conferences may be ongoing among the media mixers, and that the logic connecting the media mixers together may vary in different conferences. For example, in a first conference, a given media mixer may be a CMM that connects to one or more EMMs. In a second conference occurring at the same time as the first conference, the given media mixer may instead be an EMM. Further, in a third ongoing conference, the given media mixer might not be utilized at all. Thus, it should be evident that the roles and connectivity of any given media mixer within the conferencing system <b>100</b> may simultaneously vary from conference to conference.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">III. Exemplary Initiation of a Conference Call</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary method <b>200</b> of initiating a conference within the conferencing system <b>100</b> is shown. Although the present method <b>200</b> describes initiating a conference using the conference participant <b>102</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b>, the CMM <b>130</b>, and the EMM <b>140</b>, it should be understood that the method <b>200</b> may alternatively be applied to any of the other devices within the conferencing system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>202</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may receive a connection request from the conference participant <b>102</b> requesting a connection to a conference. In the present exemplary scenario, the conference participant <b>102</b> may be the first device to join the conference, and thus, the connection request may initiate the conference. The conference control server <b>120</b> may use identification information within the connection request (e.g., PIN, conference identification number, username, password, etc.) for authenticating the conference participant <b>102</b> and determining the conference where the conference participant <b>102</b> should connect.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>204</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may arbitrarily or selectively determine a central media mixer and an edge media mixer for the conference, which may be the CMM <b>130</b> and EMM <b>140</b>, respectively, in the present embodiment. Alternatively, the conference control server <b>120</b> may select a single mixer (e.g., a central media mixer) for the conference. In such a scenario, the conference control server <b>120</b> may wait until the capacity of the single mixer is saturated before selecting an additional mixer for connecting to the single mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step <b>206</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may connect the conference participant <b>102</b> to the EMM <b>140</b> via a media path. Exemplary messaging used during this step will be described in more detail shortly. In step <b>208</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may create a media path between the EMM <b>140</b> and the CMM <b>130</b>. Preferably, the media path enables the EMM <b>140</b> and the CMM <b>130</b> to send and receive data signals within one another via a standard call-control protocol, such as SIP. Additionally, the conference participant <b>102</b> may use the media path to send and receive data signals with future conference participants that connect to the CMM <b>130</b> and/or the EMM <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">IV. Exemplary Addition of an Edge Media Mixer to a Conference</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary data flow diagram illustrates a method <b>300</b> for adding the EMM <b>150</b> to an ongoing conference using messages <b>302</b>-<b>324</b> that are sent between the conference participant <b>106</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b>, the CMM <b>130</b> and the EMM <b>150</b>. In the present embodiment, the conference participant <b>106</b> may seek to connect to an ongoing conference that involves the CMM <b>130</b> and the EMM <b>140</b>, as described in the exemplary method <b>200</b>. Detecting that the capacity of the EMM <b>140</b> is saturated (e.g., the EMM <b>140</b> has no available media ports), the conference control server <b>100</b> may connect an additional edge media mixer (e.g., EMM <b>150</b>) to the conference for handling the new conference participant <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Prior to sending the messages <b>302</b>-<b>324</b>, the new conference participant <b>106</b> may have dialed into the conference control server <b>120</b> and been authenticated. Additionally, although each of the messages <b>302</b>-<b>324</b> in the present embodiment involves SIP, it should be understood that other types of call-control protocols may alternatively be used. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the messages <b>302</b>-<b>312</b> may establish a media path (e.g., bridge <b>328</b>) between the conference participant <b>106</b> and the EMM <b>150</b>, and messages <b>314</b>-<b>324</b> may establish a media path (e.g., bridge <b>326</b>) between the EMM <b>150</b> and the CMM <b>130</b>. It should be understood that the media path between the EMM <b>150</b> and the CMM <b>130</b> may be created prior to, after, or simultaneously with the creation of the media path between the conference participant <b>106</b> and the EMM <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A variety of different types of messages may be sent when establishing the media path between the conference participant <b>106</b> and the EMM <b>150</b>. In message <b>302</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may send an invitation message (e.g., “INVITE (URL: ConflDx, empty SDP”)) to the EMM <b>150</b> in order to invite the EMM <b>150</b> to join the ongoing conference. Within the invitation message <b>302</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may identify the conference (e.g., “ConflDx”), and have a null field for the session information used for connecting to the conference control server <b>120</b> (e.g., “empty SDP”).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In message <b>304</b>, the EMM <b>150</b> may provide a response to the invitation message <b>302</b>. For example, in the present embodiment, the EMM <b>150</b> may provide a “2000K (M2 SDP)” SIP message, which the EMM <b>150</b> uses to indicate that it will connect to the conference (e.g., “URL: ConflDx”). Furthermore, the response message <b>304</b> may include a session information field that provides information about connecting to the EMM <b>150</b> (e.g., “M2 SDP”, where “M2 SDP” represents session information for the second EMM <b>150</b>). It should be understood that the formatting of this message may vary in alternate embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In message <b>306</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may reinvite the conference participant <b>106</b> to connect directly to the EMM <b>150</b> via the message “reINVITE (M2 SDP)”. The reinvitation message <b>306</b> may also include a session information field (e.g., “M2 SDP”) that includes the session information for the EMM <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In message <b>308</b>, the conference participant <b>106</b> may provide a response (e.g., “2000K (CP SDP)”) to the reinvitation message <b>306</b>. The response message <b>308</b> may include a session information field that includes session information corresponding to the conference participant <b>106</b> (e.g., “CP SDP”). The response message <b>308</b> may have a substantially similar format to the response message <b>304</b>, though this may vary in alternate embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In message <b>310</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may send an acknowledgement message <b>310</b> to the EMM <b>150</b> (e.g., “ACK (CP SDP)”). The acknowledgment message <b>310</b> may include session information for the conference participant <b>106</b> that was received by the conference control server within the message <b>308</b>. Additionally, the conference control server <b>120</b> may send an acknowledgement message <b>312</b> (e.g., “ACK”) to the conference participant <b>106</b>. Thus, preferably after the acknowledgement message <b>312</b> is sent, a media path (e.g., “bridge <b>328</b>”) may be present between the conference participant <b>106</b> and the EMM <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present embodiment, after the bridge <b>328</b> is established, a media path (e.g. “bridge <b>326</b>”) may be established between the conference control server <b>120</b> and the EMM <b>150</b> through messages <b>314</b>-<b>324</b>. In message <b>314</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may invite the CMM <b>130</b> to connect to the new EMM <b>150</b> (e.g., “INVITE (URL: ConflDx, empty SDP)”). In message <b>316</b>, the CMM <b>130</b> may send a response to the conference control server <b>120</b> providing session information for the CMM <b>130</b> (e.g., “2000K MC SDP”, where “MC SDP” denotes session information for the CMM <b>130</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In message <b>318</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may invite the EMM <b>150</b> to connect to the CMM <b>130</b> (e.g., “INVITE (URL: ConflDx, MC SDP)”). Furthermore, in message <b>320</b>, the EMM <b>150</b> may respond to the invitation message <b>318</b> and provide session information (e.g., “2000K M2 SDP”), similar to the message <b>304</b>. In message <b>322</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may send an acknowledgement to the CMM <b>130</b>, which may include the session information for the EMM <b>150</b> (e.g., “ACK (M2 SDP)”). In step <b>324</b>, the conference control server <b>120</b> may also send an acknowledgement to the EMM <b>150</b>. Thus, at this point, a media path (e.g., “bridge <b>326</b>”) may be present between the EMM <b>150</b> and the CMM <b>130</b>. Furthermore, since the EMM <b>150</b> is also connected to the conference participant <b>106</b> via the bridge <b>328</b>, the conference participant <b>106</b> may now communicate with any conference participant connected to the CMM <b>130</b>, the first EMM <b>140</b>, and/or the second EMM <b>150</b> (e.g., conference participants <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>). It should be understood that the present embodiment may be repeated any number of times to connect any number of conference participants and/or edge media mixers to the CMM <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The exemplary arrangements within the present application may include a number of advantages. For example, the present conferencing systems may increase the potential call capacity of a conference (e.g., the number of potential conference participants) by linking multiple EMMs to a CMM. Furthermore, these conferencing systems may have a dynamic call capacity that an administrator of the conferencing system may change depending on factors such as expected call volume, types of conferences in session, and so forth. Additionally, the present embodiments may utilize a standard, high-level call-control protocol (e.g., SIP) to multiplex multiple media mixers together, without requiring structural change to the conferencing system and without changing other protocols being used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the present embodiments may have the advantage of preventing media path loops (e.g., loops that begin and end at the same media mixer) and potential long delays through the use of a star topology. Furthermore, the present embodiments may enable an administrator of a conferencing system to connect various conference participants to different EMMs, so that if a single EMM fails, most connections will still remain intact. Thus, the present embodiments may be less susceptible to mixer failure and thus, have a higher reliability. Additionally, by shifting intelligence away from the media mixer to the conference control server, the present embodiments may enable the use of simpler and cheaper media mixers while also allowing an administrator to use the conference control server to centrally control conferences.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be understood that a wide variety of additions and modifications may be made to the exemplary embodiments described within the present application. For example, more or fewer components (e.g., conference participants, conference control servers, media mixers, linking mechanisms, etc.) may be utilized with the conferencing system <b>100</b> depending on its desired functionality. Further, in an alternate embodiment, an EMM may connect to one or more other EMMs in addition to connecting to the CMM, thus enabling other media mixer configurations (e.g., chains, tree structures). Additionally, the type, number, and format of messages used within the method <b>300</b> may vary depending on consumer, manufacturing, and/or administrator preferences. It is therefore intended that the foregoing description illustrates rather than limits this invention and that it is the following claims, including all of the equivalents, which define this invention:</p>
