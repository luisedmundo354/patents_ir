<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of the invention include a testing measurement which output a non-binary test result for one or more steps or processes performed during execution of a test of a subject. The non-binary test result, which may be output by a verification point or a test script, provides a developer with an improved gauge of the subject under test. In embodiments of the present invention, a test script or verification point will, rather than simply generate a âpassâ or âfailâ (i.e., âsuccessfulâ or âunsuccessfulâ) output, generate a non-boolean value providing data with improved correlation between the test output and the relative success of a test script. In some embodiments, each verification point or test script can be associated with a rule for determining the test output which can be easily modified. This aspect provides users with an ability to carefully develop and implement a test result rule which provides output which enhances test output data analysis.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to copending commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/294,994, entitled: Organization of Test Cases and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/294,248, entitled: Testing Measurements, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention general relates to the testing of computer applications and, more particularly to testing measurements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most computer applications (hereinafter âapplicationsâ) are very complex systems that, due to their complexity, require significant testing to ensure that the application will execute as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To facilitate the testing of applications, test cases or test suites (essentially a collection of test cases) are designed, implemented and used to test a portion or the whole of an application (often referred to as the subject under test). In many applications, these test cases manipulate the external facade or interface of the subject under test. The results of these test cases are then analyzed and evaluated. As many applications are quite complex, several, sometimes hundreds, of test cases are used for the testing of a single application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a database application may need to be tested to determine whether data can be added to the database (this is the test case). A test script would need to be created to implement the test case. The exemplary test script could include several steps, instructions or processes to test this aspect of the application including: gaining access to update the database, transmitting the update request; receiving confirmation that the update request has been executed; reading from the database to determine if the data in the update request was stored successfully; and then logging off from the database.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Presently, testing enables a tester to insert a verification point at all, some or none of the steps that are performed in the test script that implements a test case. A verification point, when inserted into the test script, will issue or output a binary value (usually a single bit of dataâe.g., a boolean value) that indicates whether a step(s) with which the verification point is associated was successfully or unsuccessfully completed. The output of the test script execution, which includes the values output by the verification points, is typically stored in a test case execution script log.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The verification points enable testers to analyze the test case execution log to ascertain which processes in the test case failed and, thus, which portions of the subject under test need to be investigated to rectify any problems (i.e., solve any bugs in the application, if necessary).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some testing tools presently on the market will terminate the execution of a test script as soon as a single verification point is reached which indicates that an associated step was not performed successfully. Other testing tools will attempt, if possible, to continue processing the test script execution and outputting data from the verification points.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result of the data output by the verification points, a test script execution will generate an output which indicates whether the application successfully or unsuccessfully performed the test case (the test output). The test output of the test script execution (which is in addition to test logs that are typically generated) is, like the output of a verification point, a binary value. If even a single step in the test script failed then the entire test script execution will output a value also indicating failure of the execution of test script (i.e., the application failed in performing the test case). Only when all steps are successfully performed will the test script output indicate successful completion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It will be appreciated that when a deadline for release of an important application draws near, the application developers (the development team) are under considerable stress to have the application ready for release with a minimum number of bugs or quality or stability related issues. At this time, review of the test output data generated by the test scripts executions is often at its highest. During this review, much effort and time is spent attempting to ascertain the reason certain test scripts execution have failed to complete successfully indicating a likely problem with the subject under test. It is common in the industry, especially as deadlines loom, to disregard the test results from some test scripts execution for a variety of reasons. For example, a test script may be considered by the development team as testing an âunimportantâ or âinconsequentialâ aspect of the subject under test. Other test scripts may be disregarded on an ad hoc basis because of a developer's intuition or experience indicating that the unsuccessful result from the execution of a test script was not as a result of a failure of the subject under test but rather another application or component (e.g., the operating system, memory management, etc.). Unfortunately, this analysis is often inaccurate or misguided and potentially results in the release of an unacceptable application. Moreover, the rationale for ignoring some test results while relying on others is not documented which may prove unfortunate after a product has been released.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further shortcoming of known systems, significant time may be spent analyzing the unsuccessful results issued by a test script execution in an attempt to ascertain the cause(s) of the failure. This analysis is premised on the possibility that all failures should be determined and that most or sometimes all of the failures are the result of flaws or bugs in the subject under test. However, in some instances, the failure may be the result of a failure in another portion of the computer system(s) on which the subject under test is relying. In such an instance, a developer or tester may have misspent significant time and energy investigating a flaw which is not caused by the subject under test.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, returning to the database example described above, suppose that the test script process for logging off from the database required transmitting to the database a âlogoffâ command. Further assume that the database itself (and not the application/subject under test) had a slight bug that issued an error message despite properly logging off a user. In this scenario, the verification point associated with the portion of the test script for logging off would output indication of a failure and the test script, even if every other process completed successfully, would, as a result of the reported logoff failure, also generate test output indicating a failure of the subject under test. Moreover, unfortunately while this failing result may be technically accurate (i.e., the test script did not successfully complete each of the processes contained therein) it is misleading and inaccurate in substance (i.e., the subject under test actually successfully performed all of its processes and only another element relied upon by the subject under test failed). This situation could lead to significant time and energy being spent by a developer attempting to eradicate a bug in the subject under test which does not exist (the bug exists in the database).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, a testing measurement which addresses, at least in part, some of the shortcomings described above is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is directed to a testing measurement, and related methods, apparatus, systems and tools which address, at least in part, some the various described shortcomings.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Aspects of the invention include a testing measurement which output a non-binary test result for one or more steps or processes performed during execution of a test of a subject. The non-binary test result, which may be output by a verification point or a test script, provides a developer with an improved gauge of the subject under test. In embodiments of the present invention, a test script or verification point will, rather than simply generate a âpassâ or âfailâ (i.e., âsuccessfulâ or âunsuccessfulâ) output, generate a non-boolean value providing data with improved correlation between the test output and the relative success of a test script.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, each verification point or test script can be associated with a rule for determining the test output which can be easily modified. This aspect provides users with an ability to carefully develop and implement a test result rule which provides output which enhances test output data analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A non-boolean test result can provide a tester with data that enables a more informed decision to be made as to the status of an application under development. Moreover, in many circumstances, focus on development of a rule for determining the test output for a verification point or test script can eliminate the need to ignore test results an ad hoc basis based on an undocumented rationale.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention there is provided a verification point for use in a test script, said verification point adapted to output a non-binary value.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a test script for testing a computer application in whole or in part, said test script comprising a verification point, said verification point outputting a non-binary value.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a script for testing a computer application, said test script adapted to output at least one non-binary value.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a test tool for generating a test script for testing a computer application in whole or in part, said test tool adapted to generate a test script which outputs a non-binary value.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for generating a test script said method comprising: creating a verification point for receiving data responsive to execution of an instruction, wherein said verification point is adapted to output a non-binary value representative of execution of said instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a computer readable media containing data and instructions, said data and instructions when executed by a computer system adapt said computer system to: generate a test script for testing a computer application in whole or in part, which outputs a non-boolean value.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a verification point for use in a test script, said verification point comprising a means for outputting a non-binary value.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a test tool for generating a test script for testing a computer application in whole or in part, said test tool adapted to generate a test script comprising means for outputting a non-binary value.</p>

Communication suite <b>304</b> may include one or more of such protocols such as TCP/IP, ethernet, token ring and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Test tool <b>306</b> is used by testers and developers to generate test scripts <b>308</b> which, when executed, test aspects of application <b>312</b> and generate test output file <b>310</b>. Test tool <b>306</b> may be adapted from conventional or known test tools to perform the functions described herein. Test tool <b>306</b> may be used to: partially automate the entire testing process from generating test script <b>308</b>; test application <b>312</b> using test script <b>308</b>; and present the data in test output file <b>310</b> output by test script <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An exemplary test script <b>308</b>, illustrated in logical organization, illustrates the various components contained therein and the relationships therebetween. Generally, a test script <b>308</b> includes a start <b>402</b>, one or more instructions or processes <b>404</b>, one or more verification points <b>406</b> and an end <b>408</b>. Executing the test script <b>308</b> which will exercise a function of application <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and will result in output file <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Start <b>402</b> provides opportunity for the initialization and/or configuration of: test script <b>308</b>; the environment in which application <b>312</b> will tested; and application <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Processes <b>404</b> (processes <b>404</b><i>a</i>-<b>404</b><i>h </i>are illustrated) are the various steps or processes that are performed to test application <b>312</b>. This may include, for example, transmitting data used as input to a user interface of application <b>312</b>, issuing commands to application <b>312</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Embedded within test script <b>308</b> are one or more verification points <b>406</b> each which is used to assess the performance of one or more processes <b>404</b>. Several verification points <b>406</b> (verification points <b>406</b><i>a</i>-<b>406</b><i>d</i>) are illustrated for exemplary purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A single verification point <b>406</b> may be associated with one or more processes. Additionally, a single verification may generate an output based on one or more inputs. An input into a single verification point <b>406</b> may be a binary or non-binary value which the verification point <b>406</b> uses to generate an output indicative of the relative success of the process(es) with which the verification point is associated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Two exemplary verification points <b>406</b><i>a </i>and <b>406</b><i>b </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, respectively. The exemplary verification points are both related to the test script <b>308</b> implementing a test case designed to test an application <b>312</b> which could be used for certifying that a photographic darkroom satisfies certain requirements based on light intrusion. That is, the exemplary photography related application <b>312</b> is designed to simply certify a darkroom (based on light sensor inputs) or deny certification.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A test script <b>308</b> may be implemented to assess whether the data inputs from each light sensor (one per door into the darkroom) to application <b>312</b> used to determine whether certification is to be granted are operating properly. Such a test script <b>308</b> could include exemplary verification points <b>406</b><i>a </i>and <b>406</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As will be appreciated, no room used for photography is ever completely without light (i.e., there is always some degree of light intrusion). In conventional test scripts, the output testing the same function (proper operation of light sensor inputs) as verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>would simply indicate âPASSâ (i.e., receiving data indicating a small amount of light is reaching each light sensor and therefore each sensor was working properly) or âFAILâ (i.e., one or more light sensor inputs not working properly by failing to provide a non-zero positive reading). However, these simple test results may be unsatisfactory since one or more light sensor may be indicating that it is receiving an unexpected and incorrect amount of light. Use of exemplary verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>could be used to provide additional data.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>is designed to test and report to test script <b>308</b> the amount of light received by a particular light sensor associated with a door for entering/exiting the darkroom which is being certified by application <b>312</b>. Conventional verification points would simply test to determine whether data was being received by application <b>312</b> from a light sensor. If data was being received, a conventional verification point would generate output indicating that that portion of the test script <b>308</b> was successful. If data was not being received by application <b>312</b>, a conventional verification point would generate output indicating that that portion of test script <b>308</b> was not successful. In contrast, verification point <b>406</b><i>a</i>, which outputs an integer value (in contrast to the binary values provided by conventional verification points) provides additional data for analysis by the user, the test script or a test suite. Moreover, the verification rule used to generate the output is explicitly defined by verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>in instructions <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>. This rule explicitly defines how output from verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>is generated, the inputs used to generate this output and the type of output which is generated by verification point <b>406</b><i>a</i>. If, for whatever reason it is necessary to modify the verification rule, the rule is easily identified and modified. For example, the inputs received from application <b>312</b> and used by verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>of test script <b>308</b> may change as application <b>312</b> is developed. Accordingly, the verification rule of verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>may require modification to handle such a change. Alternatively, the test case (which is implemented by test script <b>308</b>) may change impacting the type, kind or substance of output required from verification point <b>406</b><i>a</i>. Modification of the verification rule can quickly be made to react to this scenario.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated, verification point <b>406</b><i>a</i>, which is part of a test script <b>308</b> written in the computer language JAVA, includes an instance of the class âDoorVPâ (<b>502</b>) and then, for a particular door (identified by the get DoorNumber methodâ<b>504</b>), sets the output of verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>to the required output which in the exemplary embodiment is a data representative of the amount of light (in foot candles) received by application <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> a second exemplary verification point <b>406</b><i>b </i>is illustrated. Verification point <b>406</b><i>b </i>would, like a conventional verification point, be used to test the overall output of application <b>312</b> which determines whether a darkroom meets a particular standard and can, therefore, be certified. However, unlike conventional verification point which would only indicate whether certain processes or operations were performed successfully, verification point <b>406</b><i>b </i>provides enhanced performance information. Exemplary verification point <b>406</b><i>b </i>is designed to receive as input the data output by each of the light sensors which have been collected by application <b>312</b> and stored in an array. The output of verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>(which is an instance of class âDoorVPâ-<b>502</b>) is a sum of the data representative of the light measured by each of the light sensors (<b>604</b>). The output of verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>is set by instruction <b>606</b> and is an integer (i.e., a non-binary value). The integer output of verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>may be a digital output (i.e., comprising bits of data) but the output itself does not represent a binary (i.e., TRUE/FALSE, PASS/FAIL, ON/OFF, etc.) value but rather a value which provides more information.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Similar to verification point <b>406</b><i>a</i>, verification point <b>406</b><i>b </i>also includes a verification rule (instructions <b>602</b>, <b>604</b> and <b>606</b>) which define the verification point's properties (i.e., the output generated, the calculation or computation to calculate the output and the inputs used).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the exemplary verification points <b>406</b><i>a </i>and <b>406</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) both output scalar integers, other non-binary outputs could be equally be employed. For example, a success rate indicative of the ratio of successful versus unsuccessful processes could be generated and output by a verification point <b>406</b>. Similarly, a verification point <b>406</b> could output data which indicates a value representative of relative success in a given range. For example, a verification point <b>406</b> could output â100â if all associated processes were performed successfully, â0â if all associated processes were performed unsuccessfully and a value between â0â and â100â to indicate a relative rate of success for instances where some processes were performed successfully and others were performed unsuccessfully. Raw values could be output by a verification point indicative of an operation performed by application <b>312</b>. For example, data collected by application <b>312</b> from a light sensor could be the output of a verification point. Other data types could also be output by a verification point <b>406</b> (e.g., a string, a floating point number, a boolean, etc.)</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to different types of output possible from a verification point embodying aspects of the present invention, alternative embodiments could include multiple outputs from a single verification point. For example, if processes performed by application <b>312</b> could be tested in more than one way, a verification point could be implemented which outputs multiple test results each calculating test results or verifying the performance of processes in a different manner. For example, verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) outputs an integer value indicative of the data received by application <b>312</b> from a light sensor. In an alternative embodiment verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>could, for example, additionally output a value indicative of standard deviation of input received by application <b>312</b> from a light sensor. This latter test output could be used to provide insight into the relative stability of input received by application <b>312</b> from a light sensor. Significant deviation output by this alternative embodiment of verification point <b>406</b><i>a </i>could indicate a malfunction of or bug in application <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As will be appreciated, the non-binary output and multiple outputs from a single verification point can easily be extended to a test script <b>308</b> or a test suite. That is, a test script <b>308</b> may output a non-binary value, one or more outputs and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, modifications to the above-described embodiment can be made without departing from the essence of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While one (or more) embodiment(s) of this invention has been illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described above, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the essence of this invention.
