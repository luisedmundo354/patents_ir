<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an active device array substrate, a display panel and examining methods thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to an active device array substrate, a liquid crystal display panel having an inner short ring and examining methods thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In response to the increasing demand of the display, the industry put efforts in the development of the display. Among the displays, the cathode ray tube (CRT) has occupied the display market for many years, due to its high display quality and mature technology. However, the rising “environmental protection” awareness against its power consumption and radiation disadvantage, and its limited flattening capability against the market demands of light, thin, short, small, chic, and power-saving displays, have limited the growing space of CRTs. Therefore, the thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD), having superior properties such as high image quality, good space utilization, low power consumption and no radiation, has become the mainstream display product of the market.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The TFT-LCD mainly comprises a liquid crystal display panel and a backlight module. The liquid crystal display panel usually comprises a thin film transistor array substrate, a color filter substrate and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the two substrates. And the backlight module is used to provide a surface light source for the liquid crystal display panel, such that the liquid crystal module may achieve the display effect.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The thin film transistor array substrate may be divided into a display region and a peripheral circuit region, wherein a plurality of pixel units are disposed in an array on the display region, and each of the pixel units comprises a thin film transistor and a pixel electrode connected with the thin film transistor. Moreover, a plurality of scan lines and data lines are disposed in the peripheral circuit region and the display region, wherein the thin film transistor of each pixel unit is controlled by the corresponding scan line and data line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Usually, after the manufacturing process of the film transistor array substrate, an electrical examination is performed on the pixel units on the thin film transistor array substrate so as to determine whether the pixel units work normally. When the pixel units cannot work normally, the defective components (such as the thin film transistor or the pixel electrode) or the circuit can be repaired. However, in order to examine the pixel units, an examining circuit should be fabricated on the peripheral circuit region of the thin film transistor array substrate. It should be noted that, the examining circuit is complicated, and may reduce the layout region on the panel. Furthermore, after completing the examination, the examining circuits are disabled by a laser cutting technology, so as to avoid affecting the display quality of the liquid crystal display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, electrostatic accumulation may occur in the liquid crystal display panel, due to external factors, such as transportation or environment variation. Therefore, when the charges accumulate to a certain amount, the circuit or the thin film transistor on the thin film transistor array substrate may be damaged due to the electrostatic discharge (ESD). To avoid the problem, an ESD protection circuit is usually disposed in the peripheral circuit region of the thin film transistor array substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, conventionally, to achieve the above examination and electrostatic protection functions, an examining circuit and an ESD protection circuit should be fabricated simultaneously in the peripheral circuit region of the thin film transistor array substrate. As a result, the layout of the peripheral circuit becomes more complicated, thus resulting in insufficient layout space, which works against the simplification of the manufacturing process and the improvement of the production efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a partial enlarged view of the section S<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the active device array substrate <b>100</b>, the pixel unit <b>120</b> includes a fifth active device <b>122</b> and a pixel electrode <b>124</b>. The fifth active device <b>122</b> can be a thin film transistor, a LTPS-TFT or other switch device with three terminals, and electrically connects with the corresponding scan line <b>130</b> and data line <b>140</b>. The pixel electrode <b>124</b> electrically connects with the third active devices <b>130</b>, and the pixel electrode <b>124</b> can be a transparent electrode, a reflective electrode or a transflective electrode. As described above, the material of the pixel electrode <b>124</b> may be Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Indium Zinc Oxide (IZO), metal or other conductive materials.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the active device array substrate <b>100</b>, the inner short ring <b>160</b> and the third active devices <b>180</b> may be used to prevent the electrostatic damage and the data testing lines <b>150</b> and the fourth active devices <b>190</b> also have the same function. For example, when the electro-static is conducted to the first segment <b>162</b>, a plurality of third active devices <b>180</b> connecting the first segment <b>162</b> should be turned on firstly, such that the electro-static may be conducted to the scan line <b>130</b>. However, only when the voltage of the gates <b>180</b><i>g </i>of the third active devices <b>180</b> reaches a certain threshold voltage, the sources <b>180</b><i>s </i>and the drains <b>180</b><i>d </i>can be conducted. Therefore, a part of the electro-static accumulates at the gates <b>180</b><i>d </i>of the third active devices <b>180</b> and the remaining part will thus be conducted to the scan lines <b>130</b>. As the first segment <b>162</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b> electrically connects with the scan lines <b>130</b> by third active devices <b>180</b>, the electro-static forms several shunts through conduction paths. By starting third active devices <b>180</b> and forming several shunts through paths, the static current conducted to each of the scan lines <b>130</b> is significantly reduced. In other words, the inner short ring <b>160</b> and the third active devices <b>180</b> can be used to prevent the partial circuit from the electro-static damage. Therefore, the first active device <b>172</b>, the second active device <b>174</b> and the inner short ring <b>160</b> may also be referred to as the ESD protection circuit. Additionally, the first active device <b>172</b> and second active device <b>174</b> may also be referred to as the ESD protection device. Furthermore, the mechanism of the data testing lines <b>150</b> and the fourth active devices <b>190</b> to prevent the electrostatic damage is similar to the above, and will not be repeated here. It should be noted that, the first active device <b>172</b>, the second active device <b>174</b> and the inner short ring <b>160</b> not only can be used as an ESD protection circuit, but also an examining circuit of the active device array substrate <b>100</b>. The inner short ring <b>160</b>, the first active device <b>1</b> <b>72</b> and the second active device <b>174</b> are used as an examining circuit, such that the examining circuit and the ESD protection circuit are integrated as a whole, so the layout is simple, the number of the examining pads is reduced and the layout space is large. The data testing lines <b>150</b> and the fourth active devices <b>190</b> may also be used as an ESD protection circuit, and also as an examining circuit of the active device array substrate <b>100</b>. Four methods for examining the active device array <b>100</b> will be described in detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first method for examining the active device array substrate <b>100</b> comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment <b>162</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b> to start the first active device <b>172</b> and the fourth active devices <b>190</b>, wherein the first scan signal is input to the odd scan lines <b>130</b> by part of the third active devices <b>180</b>; inputting a second scan signal to the second segment <b>164</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b>, to shut down the second active device <b>174</b> and part of the third active devices <b>180</b> connecting with the even scan lines <b>130</b>. It should be noted that, said first scan signal is a high gate voltage (Vgh) signal, and the second scan signal is a low gate voltage (Vgl) signal. Then, the steps further include inputting a first data signal to one of the data testing lines <b>150</b>, wherein the first data signal is input to the corresponding data lines <b>130</b> by part of the fourth active devices <b>190</b>; and measuring the voltage of the other data testing line <b>150</b>. When measuring the other data testing line <b>150</b>, if a voltage signal similar to that of the first data signal is measured, a short circuit may occur between the odd data lines <b>140</b> and the even data lines <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second method for examining the active device array substrate <b>100</b> comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment <b>162</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b>; then inputting a second scan signal to the second segment <b>164</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b>; and measuring the voltage of the data testing lines <b>150</b>. When said first scan signal is a Vgh signal and the second scan signal is a Vgl signal, the first active device <b>172</b> and the fourth active devices <b>190</b> will be turned on, and part of the third active devices <b>180</b> will also be turned on. In the present embodiment, the started third active devices <b>180</b> connect with the odd scan lines <b>130</b>. When the data testing lines <b>150</b> are measured, if one of the data testing lines <b>150</b> is measured to have a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal, a short circuit occurs between the odd or even data lines <b>140</b> and the odd scan lines <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above, if the measuring result is normal under the above conditions, the first and second scan signals can be changed to be Vgh signals. At that time, one of the data testing lines <b>150</b> is measured to determine whether there is a voltage signal similar to the second scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the odd or even data lines <b>140</b> and the even scan lines <b>130</b>. It should be noted that, if the first scan signal is changed to be a Vgl signal and the second scan signal is changed to a Vgh signal directly, one of the data testing lines <b>150</b> is measured to determine whether there is a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the odd or even data lines <b>140</b> and the even scan lines <b>130</b> or not.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The third method for examining the active device array substrate <b>100</b> comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment <b>162</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b>; inputting a second scan signal to the second segment <b>164</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b>; and measuring the voltage of the examining line L. If the first scan signal is a Vgh signal and the second scan signal is a Vgl signal, the first active device <b>172</b> and the fourth active devices <b>190</b> are turned on, and part of the third active devices <b>180</b> are also turned on. In the present embodiment, the started third active devices <b>180</b> connect with the odd scan lines <b>130</b>. If the examining line L is measured to have a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal, a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the odd scan lines <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, if the measuring result is normal under the above conditions, the first and second scan signals may be changed to the Vgh signal. At that time, the examining line L is measured to determine whether is has a voltage signal similar to that of the second scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the even scan lines <b>130</b>. Similarly, if the first scan signal is changed to the Vgl signal and the second scan signal is changed to the Vgh signal directly, the examining line L is measured to determine whether it has a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the even scan lines <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The fourth method for examining the active device array substrate comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment <b>162</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b>; then inputting a second scan signal to the second segment <b>164</b> of the inner short ring <b>160</b>; inputting a first data signal to one of the data testing lines <b>150</b>, wherein the first data signal is input to the corresponding data lines <b>140</b> by part of the fourth active devices <b>190</b>; and measuring the voltage of the examining line L. Therein, at least one of the first and second scan signals is the Vgh signal. Therefore, the fourth active devices <b>190</b> are turned on. If the examining line L is measured to have a voltage signal similar to that of the first data signal, a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the odd or even data lines <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">From the above methods for examining the active device array substrate <b>100</b>, it can be known that the present embodiment employs the inner short ring, the first active device and second active device as a single examining circuit to examine the odd or even scan lines, and the input odd and even signals will not affect each other. The inner short ring <b>160</b> not only can be used to prevent electrostatic damage, but also as an examining circuit of array testing of the active device array substrate <b>100</b>. By using the methods for examining the active device array substrate <b>100</b>, the circuit of the active device array substrate <b>100</b> can be examined quickly. Therefore, the examining time can be reduced and also the efficiency of the examining process can be improved.</p>

And the gray image is usually used to examine whether a mura shows in the display image of the liquid crystal display panel <b>300</b>.</p>
