<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to integrated lancing and analytical devices and more particularly to a novel integrated lancing and analytical device.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are many medical conditions which require frequent measurement of the concentration of a particular analyte in the blood of a patient. For example, diabetes is a disease which typically requires a patient to routinely measure the concentration of glucose in his/her blood. Based upon the results of each blood glucose measurement, the patient may then require a particular drug treatment (e.g., an injection of insulin) in order to regulate that the blood glucose level of the patient remains within a specified range. Exceeding the upper limit of said range (hyperglycemia) or dropping beneath the lower limit of said range (hypoglycemia) should be avoided with as much diligence as possible to prevent the patient from experiencing serious medical complications which include, inter alia, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A multi-step process is commonly practiced by diabetes patients to self-monitor the level of glucose present in their blood.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the first step of said process, a patient is required to provide a blood sample suitable for testing. Blood samples taken from a patient for blood sugar monitoring are typically obtained by piercing the skin of the patient using a lancet device. A lancet device typically includes a body and a lancet. The body is typically adapted to be held by the user, the lancet being coupled to the body and being adapted to penetrate through the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin) of the patient and into the dermis (the layer of skin directly beneath the epidermis) which is replete with capillary beds. The puncture of one or more capillaries by the lancet generates a sample of blood which exits through the incision in the patient's skin.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some lancet devices, the lancet extends from the body at all times. In other lancet devices, the lancet is adapted to be moved, when actuated, from a retracted position in which the lancet tip is disposed within the body to an extended position in which the lancet tip extends beyond the body. Typically, the movement of the lancet from its retracted position to its extended position is effected with such force that contact of the moving lancet tip with the skin of a patient results in the piercing of the skin of the patient. In many such lancet devices having a movable lancet, the lancet is automatically drawn back into the body after reaching its extended position (e.g., using a spring) in order to minimize the risk of inadvertent lancet sticks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the second step of said process, a blood glucose monitoring system is utilized to measure the concentration of glucose in the blood sample. One type of glucose monitoring system which is well known and widely used in the art includes a blood glucose meter (also commonly referred to a blood glucose monitor) and a plurality of individual, disposable, electrochemical test strips which can be removably loaded into the meter. Examples of blood glucose monitoring systems of the type described above are manufactured and sold by Abbott Laboratories, Medisense Products of Bedford, Mass. under the PRECISION line of blood glucose monitoring systems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each individual electrochemical test strip typically includes a substrate which is formed as a thin, rectangular strip of non-conductive material, such as plastic. A plurality of carbon-layer electrodes are deposited on the substrate along a portion of its length in a spaced apart relationship, one electrode serving as the reference electrode for the test strip and another electrode serving as the working electrode for the test strip. All of the conductive electrodes terminate at one end to form a reaction area for the test strip. In the reaction area, an enzyme is deposited on the working electrode. When exposed to the enzyme, glucose present in a blood sample undergoes a chemical reaction which produces a measurable electrical response. The other ends of the electrical contacts are disposed to electrically contact associated conductors located in the blood glucose monitor, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A blood glucose monitor is typically modular and portable in construction to facilitate its frequent handling by the patient. A blood glucose monitor often comprises a multi-function test port which is adapted to receive the test strip in such a manner so that an electrical communication path is established therebetween. As such, an electrical reaction created by depositing a blood sample onto the reaction area of the test strip travels along the working electrode of the test strip and into the test port of the blood glucose monitor. Within the housing of the monitor, the test port is electrically connected to a microprocessor which controls the basic operations of the monitor. The microprocessor, in turn, is electrically connected to a memory device which is capable of storing a multiplicity of blood glucose test results.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In use, the blood glucose monitoring system of the type described above can be used in the following manner to measure the glucose level of a blood sample and, in turn, store the result of said measurement into memory as test data. Specifically, a disposable test strip is unwrapped from its packaging and is inserted into the test port of the monitor. With the test strip properly inserted into the monitor, there is established a direct electrical contact between the conductors on the test strip and the conductors contained within the test port, thereby establishing an electrical communication path between the test strip and the monitor. Having properly disposed the test strip into the test port, the monitor typically displays a “ready” indication on its display.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The user is then required to provide a blood sample using a lancet device. Specifically, a disposable lancet is unwrapped from its protective packaging and is loaded into a corresponding lancet device. The lancet device is then loaded, if necessary, and fired into the skin of the patient to provide a blood sample.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">After lancing the skin, the patient is required to deposit one or more drops of blood from the patient's wound site onto the reaction area of the test strip. When a sufficient quantity of blood is deposited on the reaction area of the test strip, an electrochemical reaction occurs between glucose in the blood sample and the enzyme deposited on the working electrode which, in turn, produces an electrical current which decays exponentially over time. The decaying electrical current created through the chemical reaction between the enzyme and the glucose molecules in the blood sample, in turn, travels along the electrically conductive path established between the test strip and the monitor and is measured by the microprocessor of the monitor. The microprocessor of the monitor, in turn, correlates the declining current to a standard numerical glucose value (e.g., using a scaling factor). The numerical glucose value calculated by the monitor is then shown on the monitor display for the patient to observe. In addition, the data associated with the particular blood glucose measurement is stored into the memory for the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A principal drawback associated with diabetes management systems of the type described above is that the lancing and glucose measurement operations are performed independently of one another. As a result, the user is required to possess both a lancet device and a blood glucose test monitor (as well as an individually packaged lancet and test strip) in order to perform a single assay. Furthermore, because the lancing and glucose measurement operations are performed independently of one another, the aforementioned process for performing an assay is relatively complicated and requires a considerably high level of manual dexterity, which is highly undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, some diabetes management systems presently available in the market include a single blood glucose test device which is capable of performing both the lancing and glucose measurement operations. One type of glucose monitoring system which includes a single device for performing both the lancing and glucose measurement operations is manufactured and sold by Abbott Laboratories, Medisense Products of Bedford, Mass. under the SOF-TACT™ line of diabetes management systems. The SOF-TACT™ blood glucose meter is represented, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,506,168, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The SOF-TACT™ blood glucose meter is adapted to receive both a single disposable lancet and a single disposable test strip. In order to prepare the meter for an assay, the patient is required to open a pivotally mounted cover. With the cover opened, the patient is required to unwrap an individually sealed lancet and, in turn, mount the unwrapped lancet in a cylindrical lancet holder. In addition, the patient is required to unwrap an individually sealed test strip and, in turn, insert the unwrapped test strip into a test strip port. With a lancet and a test strip installed into the meter as described above, the cover is pivoted closed. To commence an assay, the patient positions a specified region of the monitor against his/her skin and presses an activation button. Depression of the activation button creates a pressure gradient which drives the lancet through an opening in the pivotable cover and into the patient's skin. The pressure gradient is then removed which retracts the lancet to its original unfired position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">After an opening has been formed in the skin of the patient, the blood sample is collected so that an assay can be performed. Specifically, a vacuum pump is used to draw blood from the wound site and in the direction towards the test strip. Simultaneously, mechanical linkages within the monitor use pressure to move the test strip towards the opening in the pivotable cover such that blood emerging from the patient's skin collects onto the reaction area of the test strip. When a sufficient amount of blood has been collected, the vacuum pump is deactivated. The meter then performs the assay based upon the electrochemical signal generated by the test strip and displays the result on an LCD screen.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Upon completion of the assay, the user is required to pivot open the cover of the meter and remove the used test strip and lancet. Because each test strip and lancet is designed for a single-use, the used test strip and lancet are discarded. The cover is then closed until future tests are required, at which time, the above-described process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although the SOF-TACT™ blood glucose meter effectively combines both lancing and measurement processes into a single device, the user is still required to store and use two separate disposable products (i.e., a lancet and a test strip) in order to perform a single assay. As can be appreciated, the requirement that the user store, unwrap, load and discard two separate disposable items into the device renders this system still somewhat complex to use.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, some diabetes management systems which are known in the art require only the following two items in order to complete a blood glucose test: (1) a single, reusable blood glucose test device (or monitor) and (2) an integrated, disposable, single-use test cartridge for use in conjunction with the blood glucose test device. The integrated disposable test cartridge (commonly referred to in the art as an analyte test device, an integrated lancing and analytical device or simply as an integrated disposable) includes both a lancet and an electrochemical test strip.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,561,989, there is disclosed an integrated disposable end cap which can used in conjunction with an associated blood glucose monitoring device. The integrated disposable end cap includes a thin test sensor and a thin lance which are coupled together. The thin lance is formed from a single piece of metal and includes a base and a thin needle which are connected by a thin spring.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As can be appreciated, the principal benefit of a system which uses an integrated disposable end cap in conjunction with a corresponding blood glucose monitoring device is the simplicity in which a patient can perform an assay. Specifically, a patient is required only to unwrap and load a single integrated disposable end cap onto the corresponding test device prior to performing the assay. When an assay is required, the user is only required to place his/her finger against a particular region of the integrated disposable end cap and, subsequent thereto, depress a suitable trigger or button in order to actuate both the lancing and blood analysis operations. As a result, the number and relative complexity of steps which the patient is required to perform is significantly reduced, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The integrated disposable end cap described in detail above suffers from a couple notable drawbacks in its design.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As a first drawback, the integrated disposable end cap described in detail above includes a thin lance which is constructed from a single piece of metal. Because the shape of the sharpened needle is integrated directly into the overall shape of the lance, it is to be understood that alternative types of needles configurations (e.g., multi-tip needles) can not be readily integrated into this particular end cap without necessitating a complete reconstruction of the entire thin lance, which is highly undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a second drawback, the integrated disposable end cap described in detail above is not substantially enclosed. As a result, the end cap is highly susceptible to the contamination of its lancet and/or test sensor prior to use (e.g., by moisture), which is highly undesirable.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> a first embodiment of an analyte test device which is constructed according to the teachings of the present invention, the device being identified generally by reference numeral <b>11</b>. As will be described further in detail below, device <b>11</b> is constructed as a unitary, single-use, disposable cartridge which is adapted to be releasably installed into a compatible analyte test monitor (also referred to herein as an analyte test meter). In conjunction with said analyte test monitor, device <b>11</b> is capable of performing both (1) a lancing operation on the skin of a patient in order to draw a sample of blood and (2) an analysis of the concentration of a particular analyte in said blood sample. Because device <b>11</b> can be used in conjunction with an analyte test monitor to perform both lancing and analyte concentration measurements, device <b>11</b> is also referred to herein as an integrated lancing and analytical device (or simply as an integrated disposable).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Device <b>11</b> comprises a base <b>13</b>, a lancet carrier <b>15</b> secured at one end to base <b>13</b>, a lancet <b>17</b> mounted on lancet carrier <b>15</b>, an analyte test strip <b>19</b> disposed directly above lancet carrier <b>15</b> and lancet <b>17</b>, and a cover <b>21</b> secured to base <b>13</b> over lancet carrier <b>15</b>, lancet <b>17</b> and test strip <b>19</b> to create a unitary, substantially enclosed, disposable test cartridge which preferably has a length L of approximately 27 mm, a width W of approximately 12.5 mm and a height H of approximately 3 mm. Preferably, device <b>11</b> can be mass produced with each individual device <b>11</b> enclosed within a hermetically-sealed package to protect against contamination, humidity and inadvertent lancing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be noted that device <b>11</b> is provided with a substantially flat, low profile design. As a result, multiple devices <b>11</b> can be stacked vertically on top of each other in a relatively confined area, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, base <b>13</b> is a unitary member which is preferably constructed of a rigid and durable plastic material using conventional molding techniques. Base <b>13</b> includes a substantially flat top surface <b>23</b> and a substantially flat bottom surface <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A pair of elongated sidewalls <b>27</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>2</b> extends orthogonally upward from top surface <b>23</b> and are positioned along the length of the right and left side edges, respectively, of base <b>13</b>. A longitudinal groove <b>29</b> is formed into the top surface of each sidewall <b>27</b> and serves to facilitate in securing cover <b>21</b> onto base <b>13</b>, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A pair of spaced apart front walls <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>31</b>-<b>2</b> extends orthogonally upward from top surface <b>23</b> and are positioned along the front edge of base <b>13</b>. A shortened groove <b>33</b> is formed into the top surface of each front wall <b>31</b> and serves to facilitate in securing cover <b>21</b> onto base <b>13</b>, as will be described further below. In addition, a raised abutment surface <b>34</b> is formed along the rear surface of each front wall <b>31</b>, abutment surfaces <b>34</b> serving to limit the forward displacement of lancet carrier <b>15</b> during the lancing operation, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It should be noted that a skin receiving surface <b>35</b> is formed into the front edge of base <b>13</b> between front walls <b>31</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>31</b>-<b>2</b>. Skin receiving surface <b>35</b> is represented herein as being in the form of an inwardly extending arcuate notch. However, it is to be understood that surface <b>35</b> is not limited to having an arcuate configuration. Rather, it is to be understood that surface <b>35</b> could have an alternative contour (e.g., a squared-off, or stepped, contour with multiple flat surfaces) without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In use, a patient is required to place an area of his/her body (e.g., a finger, forearm, thigh, etc.) against the front of device <b>11</b> prior to commencing the lancing and blood analysis processes, as will be described further in detail below. It should be noted that the particular shape of skin receiving surface <b>35</b> provides a couple of notable advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As a first advantage, the inward contour of skin receiving surface <b>35</b> causes the region of the patient's skin that is pressed thereagainst device <b>11</b> to bulge and distend. As a result, surface <b>35</b> serves to increase the amount of blood present in the patient's skin at the wound site just prior to the lancing procedure, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As a second advantage, the inward contour of skin receiving surface <b>35</b> prevents the wound site to be created in the patient's skin from contacting base <b>13</b>. Rather, the wound site for the patient is drawn into contact against analyte test strip <b>19</b>. As a result, blood expressed from the wound site is drawn onto test strip <b>19</b> and not onto base <b>13</b>, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A shortened rear wall <b>37</b> extends orthogonally upward from top surface <b>23</b> and is positioned along a portion of the rear edge of base <b>13</b>. A pair of spaced apart grooves <b>39</b> is formed into the top surface of rear wall <b>37</b> and serves to facilitate in securing cover <b>21</b> onto base <b>13</b>, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A pair of spaced apart and parallel partitions <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>41</b>-<b>2</b> extends orthogonally upward from top surface <b>23</b>. Partitions <b>41</b> protrude forward from rear wall <b>37</b> approximately half the length of base <b>13</b>, each partition <b>41</b> being spaced adequately in from a corresponding sidewall <b>27</b> in a parallel relationship. Furthermore, a pair of longitudinal recesses <b>43</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>43</b>-<b>2</b> is formed into top surface <b>23</b> and extend rearward from abutment surfaces <b>34</b> for the majority of the length of base <b>13</b>, recess <b>43</b>-<b>1</b> being formed between sidewall <b>27</b>-<b>1</b> and partition <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> and recess <b>43</b>-<b>2</b> being formed between sidewall <b>27</b>-<b>2</b> and partition <b>41</b>-<b>2</b>. As will be described further below, sidewalls <b>27</b>, partitions <b>41</b> and recesses <b>43</b> limit the displacement of one end of carrier <b>15</b> relative to base <b>13</b> along a linear path.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A pair of shortened tabs <b>45</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>45</b>-<b>2</b> extends orthogonally upward from top surface <b>23</b> and is positioned between partitions <b>41</b> and along rear wall <b>37</b>. As will be described further below, each tab <b>45</b> is sized and shaped to fittingly protrude through a corresponding slot in carrier <b>15</b> in order to fixedly secure one end of carrier <b>15</b> to base <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, a pair of outwardly extending wings <b>46</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>46</b>-<b>2</b> are formed onto sidewalls <b>27</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, along the rear of base <b>13</b>. As will be described further below, wings <b>46</b> serve two principal functions: (1) to provide device <b>11</b> with a keyed-type lateral cross-section along its rear end, thereby ensuring the installation of device <b>11</b> within a compatible blood glucose monitor in the proper orientation, and (2) to ensure that device <b>11</b> is suitably retained (i.e., locked) within the compatible blood glucose monitor when installed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Lancet carrier <b>15</b> is a unitary and substantially flat member that is constructed out of a rigid and durable plastic material using conventional molding techniques. Lancet carrier <b>15</b> is shaped to include a spring <b>47</b> comprising a first end <b>49</b> and a second end <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A rectangular anchor <b>53</b> is integrally formed onto first end <b>49</b> of spring <b>47</b>. Anchor <b>53</b> includes a substantially flat top surface <b>55</b> and a substantially flat bottom surface <b>57</b>. Anchor <b>53</b> is additionally shaped to define a pair of spaced apart slots <b>59</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>59</b>-<b>2</b>, each slot <b>59</b> extending transversely through anchor <b>53</b> from top surface <b>55</b> to bottom surface <b>57</b>. Each slot <b>59</b> is sized and shaped to fittingly receive an associated tab <b>45</b> from base <b>13</b>. In this manner, anchor <b>53</b> is designed to be fixedly secured onto base <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A plurality of stepped surfaces <b>61</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>61</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>61</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>61</b>-<b>4</b> are formed onto and protrude up from top surface <b>55</b> of anchor <b>53</b>. Surfaces <b>61</b> are sized and shaped to matingly engage corresponding surfaces formed in cover <b>21</b>, thereby further securing anchor <b>53</b> fixed in place.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A generally U-shaped lancet support member <b>63</b> is integrally formed onto second end <b>51</b> of spring <b>47</b>. As will be described further below, support member <b>63</b> is adapted for linear displacement relative to anchor <b>53</b> through the expansion and retraction of spring <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Support member <b>63</b> includes a rectangular platform <b>65</b> which is integrally formed onto second end <b>51</b> of spring <b>47</b>. Platform <b>65</b> includes a substantially flat top surface <b>67</b> and a substantially flat bottom surface <b>69</b>. A shallow recess <b>71</b> is formed into top surface <b>67</b> and is sized and shaped to fittingly receive lancet <b>17</b>, as will be described further below. Recess <b>71</b> is shaped so as to define a pair of posts <b>73</b> which are sized and shaped to penetrate through corresponding holes in lancet <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Support member <b>63</b> additionally includes a pair of arms <b>75</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>75</b>-<b>2</b> formed onto opposite sides of support member <b>63</b> and which extend rearwardly in parallel with one another. Each arm <b>75</b> is in the form of an elongated block which is uniformly rectangular in lateral cross-section along its length and which includes a flat abutment surface <b>77</b> against which a hammer (or other similar striking device) in the compatible analyte test monitor can strike in order to perform the lancing operation, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Lancet carrier <b>15</b> is mounted on base <b>13</b> with anchor <b>53</b> fixedly secured to base <b>13</b> and with support member <b>63</b> free to slide linearly on base <b>13</b>. Specifically, anchor <b>53</b> is disposed so that tabs <b>45</b> on base <b>13</b> fittingly project through slots <b>59</b> in anchor <b>53</b>. In this manner, anchor <b>53</b> is fixed in place in relation to base <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Having secured anchor <b>53</b> to base <b>13</b>, each arm <b>75</b> lies within a corresponding recess <b>43</b> in base <b>13</b> and bottom surface <b>69</b> of platform <b>65</b> lies in direct contact against top surface <b>23</b> of base <b>13</b>. Due to the construction of spring <b>47</b>, the application of a forward force onto abutment surfaces <b>77</b> causes platform <b>65</b> (and, in turn, lancet <b>17</b> mounted thereon) to slide along top surface <b>23</b> in the forward direction. Upon the removal of said forward force, the resilient nature of spring <b>47</b> retracts platform <b>65</b> in the rear direction and back to its original position.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Lancet <b>17</b> is a unitary member which is designed to be mounted on lancet carrier <b>15</b>. Lancet <b>17</b> is preferably constructed from a single sheet of metal which is shaped through a stamping or etching process. However, it is to be understood that lancet <b>17</b> could be manufactured out of alternative materials (e.g., plastics) and/or formed using alternative construction processes (e.g., molding or grinding processes) without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Lancet <b>17</b> comprises a substantially flat bow-shaped tab <b>79</b> which is shaped to include a pair of circular holes <b>81</b>. A sharpened needle <b>83</b> is integrally formed onto and projects orthogonally out from the front edge of tab <b>79</b>. Needle <b>83</b> is sized and shaped to pierce the skin of a patient in order to produce a blood sample. Needle <b>83</b> is represented herein as having a flattened shape with a single sharpened tip. However, it is to be understood that needle <b>83</b> is not limited to any one particular construction. Rather, it is to be understood that needle <b>83</b> could be modified (e.g., to include multiple tips or to have a cylindrical shape) without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Lancet <b>17</b> is designed to be mounted on top surface <b>67</b> of platform <b>65</b>. Specifically, bow-shaped tab <b>79</b> is sized and shaped to fit snugly within recess <b>71</b> in platform <b>65</b>, with posts <b>73</b> fittingly projecting through holes <b>81</b> in order to secure tab <b>79</b> in place on platform <b>65</b>. Accordingly, with tab <b>79</b> mounted on platform <b>65</b> as described above, needle <b>83</b> of lancet <b>17</b> extends orthogonally forward from the front edge of platform <b>65</b>. In this manner, the forward displacement of U-shaped lancet support member <b>63</b> along top surface <b>23</b> of base <b>13</b> ultimately causes the sharpened tip of needle <b>83</b> to penetrate out past front walls <b>31</b> and into the skin of the patient, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It should be noted that constructing lancet <b>17</b> as a separate component from lancet carrier <b>15</b> provides a notable advantage. Specifically, because lancet <b>17</b> is constructed separately from lancet carrier <b>15</b>, modifications to the particular geometry of needle <b>83</b> can be made simply by manufacturing alternative types of lancets <b>17</b>. As long as any alternative design to lancet <b>17</b> includes tab <b>79</b> (thereby enabling said lancet to be mounted onto platform <b>65</b>), said lancet can be utilized in analyte test device <b>11</b> in place of lancet <b>17</b>. In this manner, the manufacturer can readily modify the geometry of needle <b>83</b> by replacing lancet <b>17</b> with an alternative lancet but without requiring the manufacturer to redesign lancet carrier <b>15</b>, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Analyte test strip <b>19</b> is preferably in the form of an electrochemical test strip which is constructed to measure the concentration of a particular analyte, such as glucose, in a blood sample applied thereto. Test strip <b>19</b> is preferably constructed as a thin, rectangular member which includes a top surface <b>85</b>, a bottom surface <b>87</b>, a first end <b>89</b> and a second end <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Test strip <b>19</b> preferably includes a non-conductive substrate <b>93</b> and at least a pair of carbon-layer electrodes <b>95</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> which are deposited onto substrate <b>93</b> along a portion of its length in a spaced-apart relationship, electrode <b>95</b>-<b>1</b> serving as the reference electrode for test strip <b>19</b> and electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> serving as the working electrode for test strip <b>19</b>. An optional third electrode <b>95</b>-<b>3</b> may be provided which serves as the trigger electrode for test strip <b>19</b> (i.e., an electrode which measures whether an adequate blood sample has been deposited on test strip <b>19</b>). Together, electrodes <b>95</b> define a reaction area (not shown) proximate first end <b>89</b>. An enzyme (not shown) which produces an electrical reaction when exposed to a particular analyte (e.g., glucose) is applied to working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> within the reaction area. In addition, a fill area <b>97</b> is provided along first end <b>89</b> and is in fluid communication with the reaction area (e.g., by means of a capillary tube or some type of conventional wicking element).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In order to measure the concentration of a particular analyte in a patient's blood, the patient is required to deposit a blood sample onto fill area <b>97</b> of test strap <b>19</b>. The blood sample, in turn, is wicked and deposited deposited across electrodes <b>95</b> in the reaction area. Simultaneously, a voltage provided by the compatible analyte test monitor is applied across electrodes <b>95</b> at second end <b>91</b>, thereby effectively creating a closed circuit. The application of the blood sample on the enzyme deposited on working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> creates an electrical reaction. In response to said reaction, a current (commonly referred to in the art as the working current) is produced which travels along working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b>, the value of said working current being directly related to the concentration of the particular analyte in the blood sample. Accordingly, with device <b>11</b> properly loaded into the compatible analyte test meter, the meter is capable of measuring the value of the working current along working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> and, in turn, using said value to calculate the analyte concentration in the blood sample (e.g., by multiplying said value by a scaling factor).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the particular construction of test strip <b>19</b>. Rather, it is to be understood that test strip <b>19</b> could be replaced with alternative types of conventional analyte test strips without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Test strip <b>19</b> is press-fit mounted onto the underside of cover <b>21</b>. As will be described further below, the length of test strip <b>19</b> is such that first end <b>89</b> is disposed in direct contact against the skin of the patient (and in close proximity to the wound site created using lancet <b>17</b>) when the patient disposes his/her finger against skin receiving surface <b>35</b> in base <b>13</b>. In this manner, a blood sample generated using lancet <b>17</b> is directed onto test strip <b>19</b>, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, cover <b>21</b> is secured to base <b>13</b> over lancet carrier <b>15</b>, lancet <b>17</b> and test strip <b>19</b> to create a unitary, substantially enclosed, disposable test cartridge with both lancing and analyte measurement capabilities. Cover <b>21</b> is preferably in the form of a unitary member which is constructed out of rigid and durable plastic material using conventional molding techniques. As will be described further below, cover <b>21</b> is press-fit mounted onto base <b>13</b> and may be further secured thereto by means of ultrasonic welding or other suitable securement means (e.g., an adhesive).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, cover <b>21</b> includes a substantially flat top surface <b>99</b> and a substantially flat bottom surface <b>101</b>.

A longitudinal rib <b>105</b> is formed onto the bottom surface of each sidewall <b>103</b>, each rib <b>105</b> being sized and shaped to fittingly protrude into an associated groove <b>29</b> in sidewalls <b>27</b> so as to facilitate in the retention of cover <b>21</b> on base <b>13</b>.</p>

A notch <b>111</b> is formed into the rear surface of each front wall <b>107</b> and serves, in part, to retain test strip <b>19</b> in securement against bottom surface <b>101</b> of cover <b>21</b>, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Cover <b>21</b> is additionally shaped to define a generally U-shaped opening <b>113</b> along its front edge in between front walls <b>107</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>107</b>-<b>2</b>. Opening <b>113</b> is provided in cover <b>21</b> in order to render fill area <b>97</b> of test strip <b>19</b> externally visible to the user. In this manner, the user is able to visually inspect whether an adequate blood sample has been applied to the fill area <b>97</b> during its use, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A shortened rear wall <b>115</b> extends orthogonally downward from bottom surface <b>101</b> and is positioned along a portion the rear edge of cover <b>21</b>.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It should be noted that, with device <b>11</b> configured in its assembled form, base <b>13</b> and cover <b>21</b> together define a pair of openings <b>119</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>119</b>-<b>2</b> along their common rear surfaces, as seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Each opening <b>119</b> is generally square shaped in lateral cross-section and is minimized in size to reduce the risk of contamination within device <b>11</b>. As will be described further below, each opening <b>119</b> serves as a path through which an actuation device (e.g., a hammer) within the compatible analyte test monitor can penetrate so as to urge lancet support member <b>63</b> (and, in turn, lancet <b>17</b>) forward.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A pair of longitudinal recesses <b>121</b> is formed into bottom surface <b>101</b> of cover <b>21</b> and is disposed in direct alignment above recesses <b>43</b> in base <b>13</b> when device <b>11</b> is disposed in its assembled form. Each recess <b>121</b> is sized and shaped to fittingly receive the top surface of an associated arm <b>75</b> and thereby assist in limiting lancet support member <b>63</b> to linear displacement.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A pair of trapezoidal projections <b>123</b> is formed onto and protrude downwardly from bottom surface <b>101</b> of cover <b>21</b>. Each projection <b>123</b> includes a plurality of steps, or ratchets, which are sized and shaped to matingly engage stepped surfaces <b>61</b> on anchor <b>53</b> in order to secure anchor <b>53</b> in a fixed position within device <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Analyte test strip <b>19</b> is adapted to be retained against the underside of cover <b>21</b>. Specifically, top surface <b>85</b> of test strip <b>19</b> is disposed against bottom surface <b>101</b> of cover <b>21</b>, with first end <b>89</b> of test strip <b>19</b> wedged against the rear surface of front walls <b>107</b> and second end <b>91</b> of test strip <b>19</b> wedged against the front surface of rear wall <b>115</b>. With test strip <b>19</b> mounted on cover <b>21</b> in this manner, electrodes <b>95</b> at second end <b>91</b> of test strip <b>19</b> are externally accessible through a rectangular window <b>125</b> in cover <b>21</b>. Accordingly, with test strip <b>19</b> properly installed into a compatible monitor, a conductive element (e.g., a metal clip) from the monitor can project through window <b>125</b> in cover <b>21</b> and directly contact electrodes <b>95</b>, thereby establishing an electrical path between test strip <b>19</b> and the monitor. As such, working current present on working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> can be readily measured by the monitor, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It should further be noted that test strip <b>19</b> may be constructed to include calibration information directly thereon, said calibration information being stored in any conventional medium (e.g., as a barcode, read-only memory (ROM), one or more resistors, a particular pattern of interconnected conductive pads or a colored window) which can be easily read by the monitor when test strip <b>19</b> is properly loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown a blood glucose meter <b>131</b> which is designed specifically for use in conjunction with device <b>11</b>. Meter <b>131</b> includes a base <b>133</b> and a cover <b>135</b> pivotally mounted onto base <b>133</b>. Base <b>133</b> is provided with a test strip port <b>137</b> which is sized and shaped to matingly receive device <b>11</b>. Base <b>133</b> is also provided with one or more externally accessible buttons <b>139</b> for controlling the operation of meter <b>131</b>. A screen <b>141</b> is provided on cover <b>135</b> as a means for visually displaying blood glucose results calculated by meter <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, port <b>137</b> has a keyed-type lateral cross-section which matches the lateral cross-section of device <b>11</b>. In this manner, the particular shape of port <b>137</b> serves (1) to ensure the installation of device <b>11</b> into meter <b>131</b> in the proper orientation and (2) to enable meter <b>131</b> to engage wings <b>46</b> of device <b>11</b> when inserted thereinto, thereby precluding the inadvertent removal of device <b>11</b> from meter <b>131</b> (e.g., when meter <b>131</b> is tilted forward).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It should be noted that meter <b>131</b> represents one type of blood glucose monitor which is designed to operate in conjunction with device <b>11</b>. However, it is to be understood that alternative types of meters compatible with device <b>11</b> could be provided without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Configured in its assembled form, device <b>11</b> can be used in the following manner to acquire a blood sample and, in turn, analyze the concentration of a particular analyte in said blood sample. First, an individual analyte test device <b>11</b> is removed from its protective wrapping. Once unpackaged, device <b>11</b> is loaded by the patient into the appropriate test port of a compatible analyte test monitor. It should be noted that penetrable seals may additionally be provided for device <b>11</b> (e.g., over openings <b>119</b> or across front walls <b>31</b>) in order to further shield device <b>11</b> from contamination prior to its use.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">With device <b>11</b> properly installed into a compatible test monitor, conductive leads in the monitor project through window <b>125</b> and are disposed in electrical contact against electrodes <b>95</b>, thereby establishing a current path between test strip <b>19</b> of device <b>11</b> and the central processing unit (CPU) of the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In order to perform an blood test, the patient is required to dispose the desired test site (e.g., the patient's finger) against first end <b>89</b> of test strip <b>19</b> as well as against front walls <b>31</b> of base <b>13</b>. As can be appreciated, when adequate pressure is applied against front walls <b>31</b>, the steep inward contour of skin receiving surface <b>35</b> serves to distend and bulge the patient's skin, thereby causing the patient's imminent wound site to be replete with blood. With the patient's skin disposed against device <b>11</b> in this manner, the firing mechanism for the monitor is activated (e.g., by depressing a button on the monitor or as a result of the application of pressure along the front end of device <b>11</b> which exceeds a predetermined threshold).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Activation of the firing mechanism causes a two-pronged hammer or other similar device present in the monitor to project through openings <b>119</b> in device and contact abutment surfaces <b>77</b> of lancet support member <b>63</b>. The force of the firing mechanism would, in turn, displace lancet support member <b>63</b> linearly forward until the sharpened tip of needle <b>83</b> penetrates into the patient's skin. Lancet support member <b>63</b> advances forward until it strikes against raised abutment surfaces <b>34</b> in base, thereby limiting further forward advancement.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Immediately thereafter, the monitor retracts its firing mechanism out from device <b>11</b>. Upon the withdrawal of the forward force onto arms <b>75</b> by the firing mechanism, the resilient nature of spring <b>47</b> similarly draws lancet support member <b>75</b> rearward to its original position (with the sharpened tip of needle <b>83</b> fully retracted to preclude against further skin pricks).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Upon lancing the patient's skin, blood from the wound site is deposited onto fill area <b>97</b> of strip <b>19</b>, with U-shaped opening <b>113</b> enabling the patient to visibly inspect whether an adequate blood sample has been supplied onto strip <b>19</b> in order to perform an assay. Once an adequate blood sample has reached the reaction area of test strip <b>19</b> (i.e., activating trigger electrode <b>95</b>-<b>3</b>), the monitor then measures the working current present along working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> (the working current resulting from the reaction between the enzyme present on electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> and the blood sample applied thereto). Once the monitor measures the working current, the CPU calculates the concentration of the analyte in the blood sample using the working current (e.g., by multiplying the working current by a known scaling factor). The results of said calculation are preferably shown on a digital display on the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Upon completion of the assay, the individual device <b>11</b> is removed from the monitor and, in a subsequent step, is discarded. In this manner, it is to be understood that device <b>11</b> is designed as a single-use, disposable cartridge. Any additional testing can be performed in the same manner as described above using additional cartridges <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">It should be noted that numerous modifications could be made to device <b>11</b> without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, it is to be understood that selected components of device <b>11</b> could be modified and/or arranged in an alternative configuration without departing from the spirit of the present invention, as will be described further in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Specifically, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, there is shown a second embodiment of an analyte test device which is constructed according to the teachings of the present invention, the device being identified generally by reference numeral <b>211</b>. Device <b>211</b> is similar to device <b>11</b> in that device <b>211</b> is constructed as a unitary, single-use, integrated disposable test cartridge which has a substantially low profile and flat design and which has roughly the same dimensions as device <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Device <b>211</b> comprises a base <b>213</b>, a lancet <b>215</b> fixedly mounted onto base <b>213</b>, an analyte test strip <b>19</b> mounted on base <b>213</b> over lancet <b>215</b>, and a protective housing <b>219</b> which is adapted to receive and substantially enclose base <b>213</b>, lancet <b>215</b> and test strip <b>19</b>, as will be described further below. Preferably, device <b>211</b> can be mass produced with each individual device <b>211</b> enclosed within a hermetically-sealed package to protect against contamination, humidity and inadvertent lancing.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Lancet <b>215</b> comprises an elongated, thin rectangular member <b>245</b> which includes a flat top surface <b>247</b>, a flat bottom surface <b>249</b>, a front end <b>251</b> and a rear end <b>253</b>. Member <b>245</b> is shaped to include a transverse slot <b>255</b> along rear end <b>253</b> which is sized and shaped to fittingly receive rib <b>239</b>. In this manner, lancet <b>215</b> can be fixedly mounted onto base <b>213</b> by disposing member <b>245</b> within recess <b>229</b> such that rib <b>239</b> fittingly protrudes through slot <b>255</b>. With lancet <b>215</b> mounted on base <b>213</b> in this manner, it should be noted that top surface <b>247</b> of lancet <b>215</b> lies substantially flush with top surface <b>221</b> of base <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Lancet <b>215</b> additionally includes a flat, sharpened needle <b>257</b> which is integrally formed onto and projects orthogonally out from the front end <b>251</b> of member <b>245</b>.

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">With device <b>211</b> properly installed into a compatible test monitor, conductive leads in the monitor project through window <b>275</b> and are disposed in electrical contact against electrodes <b>95</b>, thereby establishing a current path between test strip <b>19</b> of device <b>211</b> and the central processing unit (CPU) of the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In order to perform an blood test, the patient is required to dispose the desired test site (e.g., the patient's finger) against front end <b>263</b> of housing <b>219</b>. As can be appreciated, when adequate pressure is applied against front end <b>263</b>, the steep inward contour of skin receiving surface <b>273</b> serves to distend and bulge the patient's skin, thereby causing the patient's imminent wound site to be replete with blood. With the patient's skin disposed against device <b>211</b> in this manner, the firing mechanism for the monitor is activated (e.g., by depressing a button on the monitor or as a result of the application of pressure along the front end <b>263</b> of device <b>211</b> which exceeds a predetermined threshold).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Activation of the firing mechanism causes a hammer or other similar device present in the monitor to project through open rear end <b>265</b> of housing <b>219</b> and contact rear end <b>227</b> of base <b>213</b>. The force of the firing mechanism causes second end <b>237</b> of spring <b>233</b> to advance forward towards first end <b>235</b> (thereby compressing spring <b>233</b>) which, in turn, advances lancet <b>215</b> forward. The forward advancement of lancet <b>215</b> causes the sharpened tip of needle <b>257</b> to penetrate through a small opening <b>277</b> in front end <b>225</b> of base <b>213</b>, out through opening <b>271</b> in housing <b>219</b> and, in turn, into the patient's skin.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Immediately thereafter, the monitor retracts its firing mechanism out from device <b>211</b>. Upon the withdrawal of the firing mechanism, the resilient nature of spring <b>233</b> draws lancet <b>215</b> rearward to its original position (with the sharpened tip of needle <b>257</b> fully retracted back into interior cavity <b>269</b> to preclude against further skin pricks).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Upon lancing the patient's skin, blood from the wound site is deposited onto fill area <b>97</b> of strip <b>19</b>. Once an adequate blood sample has reached the reaction area of test strip <b>19</b> (i.e., activating trigger electrode <b>95</b>-<b>3</b>), the monitor then measures the working current present along working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> (the working current resulting from the reaction between the enzyme present on electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> and the blood sample applied thereto). Once the monitor measures the working current, the CPU calculates the concentration of the analyte in the blood sample using the working current (e.g., by multiplying the working current by a known scaling factor). The results of said calculation are preferably shown on a digital display on the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Upon completion of the assay, the individual device <b>211</b> is removed from the monitor and, in a subsequent step, is discarded. In this manner, it is to be understood that device <b>211</b> is designed as a single-use, disposable cartridge. Any additional testing can be performed in the same manner as described above using additional cartridges <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>, there is shown a third embodiment of an analyte test device which is constructed according to the teachings of the present invention, the device being identified generally by reference numeral <b>311</b>. Device <b>311</b> is similar to device <b>11</b> in that device <b>311</b> is constructed as a unitary, single-use, integrated disposable test cartridge. However, device <b>311</b> differs from device <b>11</b> in that device <b>311</b> has tubular design, as will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Device <b>311</b> comprises a housing <b>313</b>, a lancet <b>315</b> slidably mounted within housing <b>313</b>, a cap <b>317</b> affixed to one end of lancet <b>315</b>, a spring <b>319</b> for urging cap <b>317</b> upward, and an analyte test strip <b>19</b> disposed within housing <b>313</b> in close proximity to lancet <b>315</b>. Preferably, device <b>311</b> can be mass produced with each individual device <b>311</b> enclosed within a hermetically-sealed package to protect against contamination and inadvertent lancing.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Housing <b>313</b> is a unitary member which is preferably constructed of a rigid and durable plastic material using conventional molding techniques. Housing <b>313</b> has a generally tubular (i.e., cylindrical) shape and includes a sidewall <b>320</b> which comprises an outer surface <b>321</b>, an inner surface <b>323</b>, an open bottom end <b>325</b> and an open top end <b>327</b>. The tubular shape of housing <b>313</b> serves to define a longitudinally extending interior cavity <b>329</b> which is accessible through open bottom end <b>325</b> and open top end <b>327</b>, interior cavity <b>329</b> being generally circular in lateral cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">A needle support <b>331</b> is integrally formed onto inner surface <b>323</b> and extends longitudinally within interior cavity <b>329</b>. Needle support <b>331</b> is generally cylindrical in shape and includes a first end <b>333</b>, a second end <b>335</b> and a longitudinally extending bore <b>337</b>, bore <b>337</b> being of reduced diameter at first end <b>333</b> and of expanded diameter at second end <b>335</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">A first pair of strip support members <b>339</b> is integrally formed onto inner surface <b>323</b> proximate bottom end <b>325</b>. In addition, a second pair of strip support members <b>341</b> is integrally formed onto inner surface <b>323</b> proximate top end <b>327</b>. Together, first and second strip support members <b>339</b> and <b>341</b> serve to retain test strip <b>19</b> in place within interior cavity <b>329</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">It should be noted that support members <b>339</b> and <b>341</b> hold test strip <b>19</b> at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of housing <b>313</b>. Furthermore, support members <b>339</b> and <b>341</b> hold test strip <b>19</b> such that its first end <b>89</b> is spaced slightly in from bottom end <b>325</b> and such that its second end <b>91</b> is substantially co-planar with top end <b>327</b>. As can be appreciated, spacing first end <b>89</b> adequately in from bottom end <b>325</b> serves to allow the patient's skin that is to be lanced to substantially distend and bulge into interior cavity <b>329</b> in order to contact first end <b>89</b>. As a result, an increased supply of blood is provided in the patient's skin prior to lancing, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Lancet <b>315</b> is an elongated, cylindrical and unitary member which is preferably constructed from a single sheet of metal which is subsequently shaped through one or more stamping and/or etching operations. However, it is to be understood that lancet <b>315</b> could be formed in a different shape (e.g., to include multiple sharpened tips), manufactured out of alternative materials (e.g., plastics) and/or formed using alternative construction processes (e.g., molding processes) without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Lancet <b>315</b> is in form of an elongated needle which includes a sharpened tip <b>343</b> at one end and a cross-bar <b>345</b> at the other end. Lancet <b>315</b> is orientated to extend axially through bore <b>337</b> in needle support <b>331</b> with sharpened tip <b>343</b> directed towards bottom end <b>325</b>. In this manner, it is to be understood that first end <b>333</b> of needle support <b>331</b> serves to sufficiently stabilize (i.e., stiffen) lancet <b>315</b>, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">It should be noted that analyte test strip <b>19</b> and lancet <b>315</b> are disposed at an acute angle a relative to one another. As a result, first end <b>89</b> of test strip <b>19</b> is disposed in close proximity to sharpened tip <b>343</b> of lancet <b>315</b>. Accordingly, once tip <b>343</b> of lancet <b>315</b> pricks the skin of a patient, the supply of blood which exits the wound site is drawn immediately onto fill area <b>97</b> of test strip <b>19</b>, which is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A thin cap <b>317</b> is fixedly mounted onto lancet <b>315</b> and is retained in place by cross-bar <b>345</b>. Cap <b>317</b> is preferably in the form of a thin disc which includes a substantially flat top surface <b>347</b> and a substantially flat bottom surface <b>349</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Spring <b>319</b> is mounted axially over lancet <b>315</b> and includes a first end <b>351</b> and a second end <b>353</b>. First end <b>351</b> of spring <b>319</b> is retained against an annular flange formed along the interior surface of needle support <b>331</b>. Second end <b>353</b> of spring <b>319</b> is disposed in contact against bottom surface <b>349</b> of cap <b>317</b>. In this manner, spring <b>319</b> serves to continuously urge cap <b>317</b> and, in turn, lancet <b>315</b> upward towards top end <b>327</b>. However, a fixed finger <b>355</b> provided in housing <b>313</b> serves as a stop for limiting the upward displacement of cap <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">It should be noted that the application of a suitable downward force onto top surface <b>347</b> of cap <b>317</b> (i.e., a force greater than the compression force of spring <b>319</b>) causes cap <b>317</b> and, in turn, lancet <b>315</b> to be displaced linearly downward towards bottom end <b>325</b>. Upon the release of said downward force, the resilient nature of spring <b>319</b> urges cap <b>317</b> and, in turn, lancet <b>315</b> back up to its original position.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Device <b>311</b> can be used in the following manner to acquire a blood sample and, in turn, analyze the concentration of a particular analyte in said blood sample. First, an individual analyte test device <b>311</b> (in its assembled form) is removed from its protective wrapping. Once unpackaged, device <b>311</b> is loaded by the patient into the appropriate test port of a compatible analyte test monitor. It should be noted that penetrable seals may additionally be provided for device <b>311</b> (e.g., over opened top end <b>327</b> and/or over opened bottom end <b>325</b>) in order to further shield device <b>311</b> from contamination prior to its use.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">With device <b>311</b> properly installed into a compatible test monitor, conductive leads in the monitor project through opened top end <b>327</b> and are disposed in electrical contact against electrodes <b>95</b>, thereby establishing a current path between test strip <b>19</b> of device <b>311</b> and the central processing unit (CPU) of the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In order to perform an blood test, the patient is required to dispose the desired test site (e.g., the patient's finger) against opened bottom end <b>325</b> of housing <b>313</b>. As can be appreciated, when adequate pressure is applied against bottom end <b>325</b>, the patient's skin bulges into interior cavity <b>329</b> and ultimately in contact against first end <b>89</b> of test strip <b>19</b>. With the patient's skin disposed against device <b>311</b> in this manner, the firing mechanism for the monitor is activated (e.g., by depressing a button on the monitor or as a result of the application of pressure along the bottom end <b>325</b> of device <b>311</b> which exceeds a predetermined threshold).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Activation of the firing mechanism causes a hammer or other similar device present in the monitor to project through open top end <b>327</b> of housing <b>313</b> and abut against top surface <b>347</b> of cap <b>317</b>. The force of the firing mechanism causes cap <b>317</b> and, in turn, lancet <b>315</b> to be displaced linearly in the downward direction (thereby compressing spring <b>319</b>). The downward displacement of lancet <b>315</b> ultimately causes sharpened tip <b>343</b> of lancet <b>315</b> to penetrate into the patient's skin. Immediately thereafter, the monitor retracts its firing mechanism out from device <b>311</b>. Upon the withdrawal of the firing mechanism, the resilient nature of spring <b>319</b> retracts lancet <b>315</b> upward to its original position.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Upon lancing the patient's skin, blood from the wound site is drawn directly into fill area <b>97</b> of strip <b>19</b>. Once an adequate blood sample has reached the reaction area of test strip <b>19</b> (i.e., activating trigger electrode <b>95</b>-<b>3</b>), the monitor then measures the working current present along working electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> (the working current resulting from the reaction between the enzyme present on electrode <b>95</b>-<b>2</b> and the blood sample applied thereto). Once the monitor measures the working current, the CPU calculates the concentration of the analyte in the blood sample using the working current (e.g., by multiplying the working current by a known scaling factor). The results of said calculation are preferably shown on a digital display on the monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Upon completion of the assay, the individual device <b>311</b> is removed from the monitor and, in a subsequent step, is discarded. In this manner, it is to be understood that device <b>311</b> is designed as a single-use, disposable cartridge. Any additional testing can be performed in the same manner as described above using additional cartridges <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, there is shown a blood glucose meter <b>411</b> which is designed specifically for use in conjunction with device <b>311</b>. Meter <b>411</b> includes a housing <b>413</b> and a tubular integrated disposable receptacle <b>415</b> which is telescopingly mounted onto one end of housing <b>413</b>, receptacle <b>415</b> being sized and shaped to matingly receive device <b>311</b>. It should be noted that the ability to displace receptacle <b>415</b> into housing <b>413</b> may, in turn, enable receptacle <b>415</b> to function as a trigger means for energizing and/or activating the internal firing mechanism (not shown) for device <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Preferably, meter <b>411</b> additionally includes one or more externally accessible buttons <b>417</b> for controlling certain operations of meter <b>411</b>. An externally viewable screen <b>419</b> is also preferably provided as a means for visually displaying blood glucose results calculated by meter <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">It should be noted that meter <b>411</b> represents one type of blood glucose monitor which is designed to operate in conjunction with device <b>311</b>. However, it is to be understood that alternative types of meters compatible with device <b>311</b> could be provided without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">It should also be noted that numerous modifications could be made to device <b>311</b> without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, it is to be understood that selected components of device <b>311</b> could be modified and/or arranged in alternative configurations without departing from the spirit of the present invention, as will be described further in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As an example, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, there is shown a fourth embodiment of an analyte test device which is constructed according to the teachings of the present invention, the device being identified generally by reference numeral <b>511</b>. Device <b>511</b> is similar to device <b>311</b> in that device <b>511</b> is constructed as a unitary, single-use, integrated disposable test cartridge which has a generally tubular design.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Device <b>511</b> comprises a generally tubular exterior housing <b>513</b>, a needle support <b>515</b> telescopingly disposed within exterior housing <b>513</b>, a lancet <b>517</b> slidably mounted within needle support <b>515</b> along a substantially vertical path, a spring <b>519</b> disposed between lancet <b>517</b> and needle support <b>515</b> for urging lancet <b>517</b> upward and away from the open bottom end <b>521</b> of exterior housing <b>513</b>, and an analyte test strip <b>19</b> fixedly mounted within support <b>515</b> in close proximity to lancet <b>517</b>. Preferably, device <b>511</b> can be mass produced with each individual device <b>511</b> enclosed within a hermetically-sealed package to protect against contamination and inadvertent lancing.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A principal distinction between device <b>511</b> and device <b>311</b> lies in the orientation of test strip <b>19</b>. Specifically, in device <b>511</b>, test strip <b>19</b> is disposed such that second end <b>91</b> extends along a substantially vertical path and in parallel with the longitudinal axis of lancet <b>517</b>. However, it should be noted that needle support <b>515</b> is specifically designed to bend test strip <b>19</b> about its approximate midpoint so that first end <b>89</b> of test strip <b>19</b> and the sharpened tip <b>523</b> of lancet <b>517</b> are disposed at an acute angle relative to one another, which is highly desirable for reasons enumerated above in conjunction with device <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">As another example, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, there is shown a fifth embodiment of an analyte test device which is constructed according to the teachings of the present invention, the device being identified generally by reference numeral <b>611</b>. Device <b>611</b> is similar to device <b>311</b> in that device <b>611</b> is constructed as a unitary, single-use, integrated disposable test cartridge which has a generally tubular design.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Device <b>611</b> comprises a generally tubular exterior housing <b>613</b>, a needle support <b>615</b> telescopingly disposed within exterior housing <b>613</b>, a lancet <b>617</b> slidably mounted within needle support <b>615</b>, a spring <b>619</b> disposed between lancet <b>617</b> and needle support <b>615</b> for urging lancet <b>617</b> upward and away from the open bottom end <b>621</b> of exterior housing <b>613</b>, and an analyte test strip <b>19</b> fixedly mounted within support <b>615</b> in close proximity to lancet <b>617</b>. Preferably, device <b>611</b> can be mass produced with each individual device <b>611</b> enclosed within a hermetically-sealed package to protect against contamination and inadvertent lancing.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">A principal distinction between device <b>611</b> and device <b>311</b> lies in the orientation of each lancet and test strip <b>19</b>. Specifically, in device <b>311</b>, lancet <b>315</b> is disposed in a substantially vertical orientation whereas test strip <b>19</b> is disposed at an acute angle relative thereto. To the contrary, in device <b>611</b>, test strip <b>19</b> is disposed in a substantially vertical orientation whereas lancet <b>617</b> is disposed at an acute angle relative thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">It is to be understood that various design features present in all of the above-described embodiments could be incorporated into a single cartridge which includes a plurality of individual modules, each module comprising both lancing and analytical components. As can be appreciated, such a cartridge would allow for numerous blood glucose tests to be undertaken without necessitating the unwrapping, installation and disposal of a single use cartridge after each assay.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Specifically, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>, there is shown a cartridge constructed according to the teachings of the present invention, the cartridge being identified generally by reference numeral <b>711</b>. Cartridge <b>711</b> includes a plurality individual test modules <b>713</b> which are radially arranged so as to provide cartridge <b>711</b> with a daisywheel-type configuration. As will be described further below, each test module <b>713</b> is individually sealed and is designed, in conjunction with a compatible analyte test meter, to lance the skin of a patient in order to draw a sample of blood and, subsequent thereto, analyze the concentration of a particular analyte in the blood sample.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Cartridge <b>711</b> includes a bottom housing <b>715</b> which is shaped to define a plurality of radially arranged recesses <b>717</b>. A square-shaped opening <b>719</b> is formed within each recess <b>717</b>. An analyte test strip <b>19</b> is fittingly disposed within each recess <b>717</b> in bottom housing <b>715</b>, the electrodes for test strip <b>19</b> being externally accessible (i.e., for electrical contact with a compatible monitor) through its associated opening <b>719</b>. Preferably, a square-shaped, adhesive seal <b>721</b> is disposed between test strip <b>19</b> and bottom housing <b>715</b> in order to protect (i.e., seal) test strip <b>19</b> from humidity or other similar outside elements which could compromise the performance of test strip <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">A top housing <b>723</b> is fixedly mounted onto bottom housing <b>715</b> by any conventional means, such as through ultrasonic welding or using an adhesive. A plurality of alignment posts <b>725</b> formed on bottom housing <b>715</b> and a plurality of complementary bores <b>727</b> formed into top housing <b>723</b> serve to ensure the proper orientation of top housing <b>723</b> relative to bottom housing <b>715</b>. A plurality of radially extending partitions (not shown) are formed onto the underside of top housing <b>723</b> and, with cartridge <b>711</b> in its assembled form, create a seal between adjacent test modules <b>713</b>, which is highly desirable. In addition, top housing <b>723</b> is also shaped to include a plurality of radially extending slots <b>729</b>, each slot <b>729</b> aligning directly above a corresponding test strip <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">A W-shaped spring, or bow, <b>731</b> is fixedly secured at both of its free ends onto the underside of top housing <b>723</b>, one spring <b>731</b> aligning directly above a corresponding test strip <b>19</b>. A sharpened lancet <b>733</b> is fixedly mounted onto the approximate midpoint of spring <b>731</b>. As such, with spring <b>731</b> secured onto top housing <b>723</b>, lancet <b>733</b> is capable of being displaced radially outward by a suitable force applied thereto, spring <b>731</b> retracting lancet <b>733</b> back to its original position upon the withdrawal of said force.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">With top housing <b>723</b> affixed to bottom housing <b>715</b>, there are defined a plurality of pressure rings <b>735</b> (one ring <b>735</b> shown in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). Each pressure ring <b>735</b> serves as an external passageway into a particular module <b>713</b> (i.e., through which lancet <b>733</b> can extend and lance the skin of the patient).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">An annular film <b>737</b> is adhesively bonded to the top surface of top housing <b>723</b> over slots <b>729</b>. Similarly, a removable flap <b>739</b> is adhesively secured over the pressure ring <b>735</b> of each module <b>713</b>. Together, film <b>737</b> and flaps <b>739</b> serve to further protect (i.e., seal) each module <b>713</b> from outside elements (e.g., humidity) which could compromise the proper operation of test strip <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Configured in its assembled form, cartridge <b>711</b> can be used in the following manner to acquire a blood sample and, in turn, analyze the concentration of a particular analyte in said blood sample. First, cartridge <b>711</b> is removed from any protective wrapping or packaging and is loaded into the appropriate port of a compatible analyte test monitor. With cartridge <b>711</b> properly loaded, the pressure ring <b>735</b> for a single module <b>713</b> is disposed outside the monitor. It should be noted that conductive leads in the monitor project through an opening <b>719</b> and into electrical contact against the electrodes <b>95</b> of the test strip <b>19</b> for the same module <b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In order to perform a blood test, the patient is first required to peel off the removable flap <b>739</b> which covers the exposed pressure ring <b>735</b>. Next, the patient positions the desired test site (e.g., the patient's finger) against the exposed pressure ring <b>735</b>, the shape of pressure ring <b>735</b> causing the test site to bulge and distend, which is highly desirable. With the patient's skin pressed against ring <b>735</b> in this manner, the firing mechanism for the monitor is activated (e.g., by depressing a button on the monitor).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Activation of the firing mechanism causes a piercing member or other similar device present in the monitor to penetrate through annular film <b>737</b> and into the slot <b>729</b> within the particular module <b>713</b>. The piercing member then travels linearly outward within the path defined by slot <b>729</b> and ultimately abuts against a projection <b>741</b> formed at the approximate midpoint of spring <b>731</b>. Further linear translation of the piercing member drives lancet <b>733</b> radially outward, through ring <b>735</b>, and into the patient's skin.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Immediately thereafter, the monitor retracts the piercing member. Upon the retraction of the piercing member, the resilient nature of spring <b>731</b> draws lancet <b>733</b> back inside to prevent against future inadvertent skin pricks. Upon lancing the patient's skin, blood from the wound site directly deposits into the fill area of the strip <b>19</b> located within the particular module <b>713</b>. Once an adequate blood sample has reached the reaction area of the test strip <b>19</b>, the monitor measures the working current present on strip <b>19</b> and, in turn, calculates the concentration of the particular analyte in the blood sample using the measured working current. The results of the calculation are preferably shown on a digital display on the monitor.</p>
