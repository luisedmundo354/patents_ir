<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a non-provisional of and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/615,795, filed Nov. 1, 2004 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/662,848, filed Mar. 17, 2005, the entire contents and disclosures of which are hereby incorporated.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many households and businesses provide disposable paper towels in restrooms, kitchens and other areas. A variety of different types, shapes and sizes of helpful paper towels have been developed, including, without limitation, stacked or rolled towels, boxed or rolled tissue, and different types of stacked and canisterized wet wipes for cleansing, disinfecting, dusting, polishing, shining and other purposes. In addition, many households and businesses store several items in the same rooms where they provide the paper towels. These items include cleansing products, deodorizers, plants, pictures and art pieces, among other articles. For these reasons, there is a growing need to facilitate the accessibility and use of these paper towels, and there is also a growing need to facilitate the shelving of items in the areas where these paper towels are located.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The dispensing system and assembly, in one embodiment, includes a disposable towel dispenser integrated with a shelf. The dispenser includes multiple compartments for different types of disposable towels. For example, one compartment is configured to dispense dry paper towels through a bottom chute, and another compartment is configured to dispense wet wipes or wet towels through a side chute. The dispensing system and assembly has hanging mounts which enable users to conveniently hang the assembly on their bathroom, kitchen and other walls. Such convenience facilitates the use of disposable towels in households and businesses. The use of disposable towels, instead of cloth towels, can reduce the spread of illness caused from the sharing of contaminated cloth towels. In addition, the use of wet wipes or wet towels, some of which can include antibacterial solutions, can decrease the spread of cold viruses and other diseases. In operation, a user can install or load disposable towels into the dispensing assembly by removing the lid. After loading the dispensing assembly with disposable towels and closing the lid, users can shelve various items on the dispensing assembly for decoration or utility purposes, providing increased counter space. In addition to shelving their items on the dispensing assembly shelf, users can conveniently withdraw towels or wipes from the dispensing assembly with one hand.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the figures.</p>

In one embodiment, such disposable towel includes a liquid, lubricant, cleanser, polish, disinfectant, medication, perfume, fragrance or other chemical added to the towel during the manufacture, assembly or packaging of the towel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">I. Multi-Compartment Assemblies</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, in one embodiment the multi-compartment dispensing assembly <b>10</b> includes: (a) a housing <b>12</b> which includes a bottom dispensing compartment <b>14</b> and a side dispensing compartment <b>16</b>; (b) a door <b>18</b> which covers part or all of the compartments <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> when closed; and (c) a plurality of picture-type hang mounts, hangers or hang mounts <b>20</b> connected to the rear wall <b>22</b> of the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The bottom dispensing compartment <b>14</b> holds a plurality of disposable towels <b>24</b> or a disposable towel unit <b>26</b>. Likewise, the side dispensing compartment <b>16</b> holds a plurality of disposable towels <b>28</b> or a disposable towel unit <b>30</b>. The bottom dispensing compartment <b>14</b> includes a plurality of retaining walls <b>32</b> connected to a bottom wall <b>34</b>. The bottom wall <b>34</b> includes an outlet wall <b>36</b> which defines a chute or outlet <b>38</b>. In one embodiment, the outlet wall <b>36</b> has an elongated slot shape including a plurality of side portions <b>40</b> and a central portion <b>42</b>. Each side portion <b>40</b> has a rounded rectangular configuration, and the central portion <b>42</b> has a partially circular or circular configuration. The width <b>44</b> of the central portion <b>42</b> is greater than the width <b>46</b> of each of the side portions <b>40</b>. This assists users in accessing the paper towels <b>24</b> to pull a paper towel <b>24</b> through the outlet <b>38</b>. For example, the width <b>44</b> can be sized to enable a user to insert a portion of his or her fingers through the outlet <b>38</b> to reach a paper towel <b>24</b>. It should be appreciated that the outlet <b>38</b> can include a configuration of variable widths, and the portion with the greater width can be located at any suitable location along the outlet wall <b>36</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The door <b>18</b> has a substantially flat or a flat configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. As such, when the door <b>18</b> is in the closed position <b>62</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the door <b>18</b> functions a shelf or shelving surface. Accordingly, the door <b>18</b> has a shelf surface <b>19</b>. This enable users to store or rest a plurality of shelvable items <b>64</b> on the multi-compartment dispensing assembly <b>10</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the door <b>18</b> is configured to fit within the perimeter recess <b>66</b> defined by the exterior housing walls <b>68</b> and the retaining walls <b>32</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. Accordingly, in this example, the door <b>18</b> has no hinges or connectors which would mechanically couple the door <b>18</b> to the housing <b>12</b>. Put another way, the door <b>18</b> is hingelessly carried by the housing <b>12</b> in a slot-groove configuration. As such, the user can insert the door <b>18</b> into the perimeter recess <b>66</b> to close the door <b>18</b>, and the user can open the door <b>18</b> by removing the door <b>18</b> from the perimeter recess <b>66</b>.
