<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention concerns imaging arrays and methods, particularly methods for correcting or compensating for defective or malfunctioning photodetectors in an imaging array.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Imaging arrays are electronic devices that sense light and output electrical signals representative of the sensed light. The imaging arrays are generally coupled to a television screen, computer monitor, or digital camera, which displays or records an image based on the output electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An imaging array often includes a rectangular array or matrix of thousands or even millions of photodetectors, with each photodetector having a unique row and column position within the array which corresponds to a particular region, known as a pixel, of a displayed image. Each photodetector (or sensor pixel) converts sensed light into corresponding electric signals based on the intensity of the light. The electrical signals are converted into digital signals, comprising ones and zeros, which are processed by a digital-signal-processing circuit. This circuit ultimately outputs image signals to a device for recording or viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One problem with conventional imaging arrays concerns defective or malfunctioning photodetectors. Defective photodetectors typically result in erroneous image signals that ultimately degrade the quality of resulting images. For example, an image based on imaging signals from an imaging array having a defective photodetector can have a black or dark area at the image region corresponding to the defective photodetector.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One limited solution to this problem has been to identify the defective photodetector and to generate a substitute image signal for the image signal of the defective photodetector, with the substitute image signal based on an average of the image signals from detectors surrounding it. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,655 (which is incorporated herein by reference). However, this solution suffers from the disadvantage that the substitute image signal introduces artifacts into the resulting image. The artifacts reflect the complete loss of information about the light actually striking the relatively large area corresponding to the defective photodetector.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for other methods of handling defective photodetectors.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following detailed description, which references and incorporates <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, describes and illustrates one or more specific embodiments of the invention. These embodiments, offered not to limit but only to exemplify and teach, are shown and described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to implement or practice the invention. Thus, where appropriate to avoid obscuring the invention, the description may omit certain information known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present inventor devised new imaging arrays and related methods for compensating for defective photodetectors. One exemplary embodiment of a new imaging array includes two or more group photodetectors, or “group pixels,” with each group pixel having two or more photodetectors coupled to produce a single group image signal. If the group image signal for a group pixel falls below some threshold level indicative of a defective or malfunctioning photodetector, the group image signal is amplified to compensate for the loss.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various embodiments implement the photodetectors as passive or active photodiode circuits, as photogate circuits, as logarithmic sensor pixel circuits, or as charge-modulation devices. Some embodiments also implement the photodetectors as smaller-than-conventional photodetectors, that is, photodetectors having photo-sensing elements smaller than conventional elements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary imaging array <b>100</b> incorporating teachings of the present invention. Imaging array <b>100</b> includes group pixels <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b>, an address line <b>120</b>, a drain line <b>130</b>, a reset line <b>140</b>, and a signal line <b>150</b>. for controlling the group pixels. (For clarity, the figure omits conventional features, such as row-select logic, column-select logic, timing-and-control circuitry, and analog-to-digital converters.) In the exemplary embodiment, array <b>100</b> includes four group pixels; however, other embodiments include 256×256 arrays, 512×512 arrays, 1024×1024 arrays. Still larger arrays are also within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of group pixels <b>110</b>-<b>116</b> includes two or more photodetectors, or sensor pixels. Group pixel <b>110</b> includes sensor pixels <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and <b>110</b><i>d</i>, and group pixels <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> include respective sensor pixels <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>d</i>, and <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>d</i>. Lines <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, and <b>140</b>, in the exemplary embodiment, control the group pixel in accord with known techniques for addressing and controlling conventional sensor pixels in imaging arrays. In some embodiments, each group pixels provides a particular output color, such as red, blue, or green.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of an exemplary group-pixel circuit <b>200</b> applicable to each of group pixels <b>110</b>-<b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Circuit <b>200</b> includes N sensor pixels, of which sensor pixels <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>208</b> are representative, a summer <b>210</b>, a variable-gain amplifier <b>212</b>, and an automatic gain controller <b>214</b>. The N pixels <b>202</b>-<b>206</b>, which operate according to known principles, are coupled to an input of summer <b>208</b>, either through direct connection or through a multiplexer (not shown). Some embodiments include one or more analog-to-digital converters coupled between the signal lines of the pixels and the summer, depending on whether summer <b>210</b> is analog or digital.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Summer <b>210</b> aggregates the N responses of the N pixels <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> and outputs a first aggregate or group image signal to amplifier <b>212</b>. (Some embodiments include an analog-to-digital converter <b>211</b> between the summer and the amplifier.) Amplifier <b>212</b>, which in some embodiments is analog and in others is digital, amplifies or scales the first group image signal and outputs a second group image signal to automatic gain controller <b>214</b> as well as to conventional imaging processing and display circuitry (not shown.) See U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,655, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Automatic gain controller <b>214</b>, which is analog or digital, compares the second group image signal to an analog or digital reference current or voltage. If the comparison <b>215</b> indicates that the second group image signal differs from the reference <b>217</b>, controller <b>212</b> proportionately changes, that is, increases or decreases, the gain of amplifier <b>210</b>, assuming that one or more of the N pixels or related interconnective circuitry is faulty. In the exemplary embodiment, gain controller <b>214</b> sets the gain to a factor proportional to the ratio of N, the number of pixels comprising the group pixel to M, the number of correctly operating or non-faulty pixels in the group pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To determine the number of non-faulty pixels, some embodiments, check the performance of each pixel in each group pixel as a start-up diagnostic test and maintain a record of the number of faulty or non-faulty pixels in each group pixel.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exemplary sensor pixel circuit <b>300</b> applicable to each of the pixels in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Circuit <b>300</b>, a photodiode-type active sensor pixel circuit, includes photodiode <b>310</b>, a source-follower field-effect transistor SF, a row-select field-effect transistor SL, and a charge-reset field-effect transistor RS. (An n-channel load transistor for source-follower transistor SF is not shown.) Each field-effect transistor has respective gate, drain, and source nodes. The circuit further includes an address line <b>320</b>, a drain line <b>330</b>, a reset line <b>340</b>, and a signal line <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In operation, a voltage develops across photodiode <b>310</b> based on incident light. Application of appropriate control signals on the gate of transistor SL produces an image signal on signal line <b>350</b> based on the voltage across the photodiode. Signal line <b>350</b> couples the image signal to an input node of an analog-to-digital converter or summer, such as summer <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various embodiments implement the photodetectors as passive or active photodiode circuits, as photogate circuits, as logarithmic sensor pixel circuits, or as charge-modulation devices. (See, for example, Eric R. Fossum, CMOS Image Sensors: Electronic Camera-On-A-Chip, 1995 International Electron Devices Meeting Digest of Technical Papers, which is incorporated herein by reference.) Some embodiments each photodetector occupies a surface area less than 30 square microns, such as 15 or 25 square microns. Some of these embodiments have a fill factor greater than 30 percent. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any particular photodetector circuit or class of photodetector circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In furtherance of the art, the iventors have presented new imaging arrays and related methods for compensating for defective photodetectors. One exemplary embodiment of a new imaging array includes one or more group pixel circuits, each of which comprises two or more photodetectors that are substantially smaller than conventional photodetectors, for example about 15 or 25 square microns. Each group pixel circuit produces a single group image signal. The group image signal is then scaled or amplified to compensate for defective or malfunctioning photodetectors.</p>
