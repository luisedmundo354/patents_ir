<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0012039, filed on Feb. 14, 2005, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and its fabrication and operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor memory devices can be classified into volatile memory devices and non-volatile memory devices. Volatile memory devices cannot retain data without a continuous supply of power. One representative volatile memory device is a dynamic random access memory (DRAM). On the other hand, non-volatile memory devices can retain stored data even without power. A flash memory is an example of a non-volatile memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional volatile and non-volatile memory devices are in a complementary relationship. Recently, attraction for a memory device having the advantages of both the volatile memory device and the non-volatile memory device is increasing. As a result, various types of memory devices have been introduced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one conventional memory device introduced recently. This is a ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) with a cob structure including a ferroelectric capacitor formed on a bit line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a transistor Tr is formed to a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. A first interlayer insulating layer <b>18</b> is formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. The first interlayer insulating layer <b>18</b> covers a gate <b>16</b> of the transistor Tr. A portion of the first interlayer insulating layer <b>18</b> is removed to form a first contact hole <b>20</b> exposing a source region <b>12</b> of the transistor Tr. A bit line <b>22</b> is formed on the first interlayer insulating layer <b>18</b>, filling the first contact hole <b>20</b>. A second interlayer insulating layer <b>24</b> covering the bit line <b>22</b> is formed on the first interlayer insulating layer <b>18</b> and the bit line <b>22</b>. A second contact hole <b>25</b> exposing a drain region <b>14</b> is formed by penetrating the first interlayer insulating layer <b>18</b> and the second interlayer insulating layer <b>24</b>. The second contact hole <b>25</b> is filled with a conductive plug <b>26</b>. A bottom electrode <b>28</b> covering the conductive plug <b>26</b> is formed on the second interlayer insulating layer <b>24</b>. The bottom electrode <b>28</b> is covered with a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) layer <b>30</b>. The PZT layer <b>30</b> is covered with a top electrode <b>32</b>. The bottom electrode <b>28</b>, the PZT layer <b>30</b> and the top electrode <b>32</b> compose a ferroelectric capacitor. A third interlayer insulating layer <b>34</b> covering the ferroelectric capacitor is formed on the second interlayer insulating layer <b>24</b>. A plate line <b>36</b> connected to the top electrode <b>32</b> is formed on the third interlayer insulating layer <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The memory device has the characteristics of volatile memory device having one transistor and one capacitor, that is, a DRAM structure, and replaces the capacitor with a ferroelectric capacitor, thereby also gaining advantages of a non-volatile memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, since the conventional memory device is capable of writing only one bit of data per cell, the integration scale of data per cell is limited.</p>

The first conductive plug <b>50</b> and the second conductive plug <b>52</b> may be conductive materials or semiconductive materials doped with conductive impurities. A first bottom electrode <b>54</b> and a second bottom electrode <b>56</b> exist on top of the interlayer insulating layer <b>48</b> and the first and second conductive plugs <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively. The first bottom electrode <b>54</b> and the second bottom electrode <b>56</b> are spaced apart and respectively connected to the source region <b>42</b> and the drain region <b>44</b> through the first conductive plug <b>50</b> and the second conductive plug <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A dielectric layer <b>58</b> covering the first bottom electrode <b>54</b> and the second bottom electrode <b>56</b> is formed on the interlayer insulating layer <b>48</b>.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A top electrode <b>60</b> is formed on the dielectric layer <b>58</b>. The top electrode <b>60</b> surrounds the first bottom electrode <b>54</b> and the second bottom electrode <b>56</b>.

Therefore, the first capacitor C<b>1</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> may be replaced with other types of storage nodes. For example, the first capacitor C<b>1</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> may be storage nodes that do not include a capacitor, such as resistive RAM or phase change RAM (PRAM) storage nodes, etc. In other words, the first and the second storage nodes may be adapted for use as the storage nodes in RAM-type memory devices such as PRAM, RRAM, etc. A detailed description of these various types of storage nodes will be provided later.</p>

Hence, the two-storage-node architecture of the semiconductor memory device <b>38</b> is capable of storing one bit of data in each storage node, and as a result, can store 2 bits of data (e.g., ‘00’, ‘01’, ‘10’, or ‘11’) per unit cell.</p>

A group including the source region <b>42</b>, the drain region <b>44</b> and the stacked gate structure <b>46</b> define a field effect transistor (hereinafter, referred to as a transistor). A first interlayer insulating layer L<b>1</b> (corresponding to layer <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) covering the transistor is formed on the substrate <b>40</b> and then planarized. A first contact hole h<b>1</b> and a second contact hole h<b>2</b> are formed in the first interlayer insulating layer L<b>1</b>. The first contact hole h<b>1</b> and the second contact hole h<b>2</b> respectively expose the source region <b>42</b> and the drain region <b>44</b>. Afterwards, a first conductive plug <b>50</b> and a second conductive plug <b>52</b> respectively fill the first and second contact holes h<b>1</b> and h<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a second interlayer insulating layer L<b>2</b>, an etch barrier layer <b>70</b> and a third interlayer insulating layer L<b>3</b> are sequentially formed on the first interlayer insulating layer L<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a first via hole b<b>1</b> exposing the first conductive plug <b>50</b> and a second via hole b<b>2</b> exposing the second conducive plug <b>52</b> are formed in a stack structure S including the second interlayer insulating layer L<b>2</b>, the etch barrier layer <b>70</b> and the third interlayer insulating layer L<b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a top electrode <b>60</b> is formed on the dielectric layer <b>58</b>′.

Further, the top electrode <b>60</b> is formed to be discontinuous over the tops of (above) the first and second bottom electrodes <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> but continuous between the first bottom electrode <b>54</b> and the second bottom electrode <b>56</b>. This type of the top electrode <b>60</b> can be easily obtained through a photolithography process. On the basis of the above-described operations, the memory device <b>38</b> (including one transistor and two capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> connected respectively with the source region <b>42</b> and the drain region <b>44</b> of the transistor) is provided.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A detailed description of an operating method according to an example embodiment of the present invention, for a semiconductor memory device will now be provided. Particularly, a semiconductor memory device including a capacitor as a storage node, e.g., the two-storage-node architecture of the semiconductor memory device <b>38</b>, is used as an example. The operating method set forth herein may also be applied to a memory device including a storage node that does not include a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">First, a write operation will be described. Like reference numerals denote like elements even in different drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-13</figref> illustrate an example in which 2 bits of data are written to a first capacitor C<b>1</b> and a second capacitor C<b>2</b> connected respectively to the source region <b>42</b> and drain region <b>44</b> of a first transistor T<b>1</b> in the NAND memory device <b>64</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It is assumed that the first and second capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are ferroelectric capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the first transistor T<b>1</b> and third transistor T<b>3</b> are turned off, and the second transistor T<b>2</b> is turned on. A voltage for the write operation, for example, approximately 5 V, is supplied to a bit line BL, and a ground voltage, for example, approximately 0 V, is supplied to a plate line <b>62</b> between the first capacitor C<b>1</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b>. Other plate lines <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are not supplied with a voltage. That is, the other plate lines <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are floated. An electric potential difference is generated between a first bottom electrode <b>54</b> and a top electrode <b>60</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b>. The electric potential difference is generated at a first region A<b>1</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b>. Accordingly, the first portion A<b>1</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> is polarized in a first direction. When the first region A<b>1</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> is polarized as described above, it is considered that data, e.g., ‘1’ is written to the first region A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After this write operation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the first transistor T<b>1</b> is kept off, the second transistor T<b>2</b> is turned off and the third transistor T<b>3</b> is turned on. At this time, the voltages supplied to the bit line BL and the plate line <b>62</b> are maintained, e.g., the same as the above. Except for the plate line <b>62</b>, the other plate lines <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are floated. As a result, an electric potential difference is generated between the second bottom electrode <b>56</b> and the top electrode <b>60</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b>. The electric potential difference is generated at a second region of the dielectric layer <b>58</b>, and thus the second region A<b>2</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> is polarized in a second direction at least substantially antiparallel to the first direction. This polarization direction of the second region A<b>2</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. When the second region A<b>2</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> is polarized as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it is considered that data, e.g., ‘1’ is written to the second region A<b>2</b>. When the first region A<b>1</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> has the second polarization direction and/or the second region A<b>2</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> has the first polarization direction, it is considered that data, e.g., ‘0’ is written in the first region A<b>1</b> and/or the second region A<b>2</b>. This result may be obtained when the bit line BL is supplied with approximately, e.g., 0 V and the plate line <b>62</b> is supplied with a voltage for the write operation, for example, approximately 5 V.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> illustrate an example in which two bits of data ‘01’ are written to the memory device <b>64</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (including a first capacitor C<b>1</b>, a second capacitor C<b>2</b> and a first transistor T<b>1</b>) (hereinafter referred to as a 2-bit memory device). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates the operation of writing data ‘0’ to a first region A<b>1</b> of a dielectric layer <b>58</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the operation of writing data ‘1’ to a second region A<b>2</b> while data ‘0’ is maintained at the first region A<b>1</b>. Similarly, the above-described operating method can be used to write two bits of data in the patterns ‘10’ and ‘00’ to the 2-bit memory device, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the first and second capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, which are storage nodes of the 2-bit memory device, are storage nodes of PRAM, the write operation can be, e.g., identical except for the magnitude and direction of the supplied current.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A read operation will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the first and second capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are used as storage nodes, the read operation of 2 bits of data written to the 2-bit memory device can be, e.g., identical to that of a FRAM. For example, a voltage for the read operation, e.g., approximately 5 V, is supplied to the plate line <b>62</b>, and approximately 0 V is supplied to the bit line BL. At this time, the polarization direction corresponding to the data ‘0’ (i.e., the polarization of the first region A<b>1</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) does not change. However, the polarization direction corresponding to the data ‘1’ (i.e., the polarization of the first and second regions A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> of the dielectric layer <b>58</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) is inverted. Hence, after reading the data ‘1’, a voltage opposite to the read voltage is supplied to revert the polarization to its state before the read operation.</p>

The storage node layer <b>84</b> may include, e.g., a material having a minimum resistance higher than the resistance of the first transistor T<b>1</b>, the second transistor T<b>2</b> or the third transistor T<b>3</b> when the same are turned on, respectively.
