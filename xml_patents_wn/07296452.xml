<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to metallic wire, more specifically to metallic wire for grip rings to be used in a tube connector, which is a metallic connector, for connecting tubes to be inserted through both ends thereof, requiring no finishing treatment on ends of the tubes but preventing movement of the tubes in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Furthermore, the present invention relates to grip rings to be used in a tube connector, which is a metallic connector, for connecting tubes to be inserted through both ends thereof, requiring no finishing treatment on ends of the tubes but preventing movement of the tubes in the axial direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Connectors are used to connect tubes for piping which have been heavily used in the industrial equipment to each other. Connectors with various kinds of structures capable of immobilizing tubes with respect to each other and ensuring the sealing performance at the connecting portion have been proposed. Among the structures associated with strong immobilizing means, those associated with a flange method, a screw-in method, a welding method, and the like have been in heavy usage. However, piping work is not efficient and potential leakage due to improper piping work can not be ignored either.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Thus, simplified connectors which do not require processes such as threading, welding, and the like and are adapted for a little eccentricity of tubes with respect to each other have been often used. In the simplified connector, with a rubber gasket and a retainer attached to each end of a sleeve member by means of coupling, the sealing at end potions of tubes is ensured by the elasticity of the rubber gaskets, and as-cut end portions of the tubes are connected to each other only through tightening the coupling. Furthermore, in some uses, the members are initially assembled into a single connector and then each end portion of the tubes is inserted into the single connector from both of the directions so as to connect the tubes to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">In the simplified connector described above, because the rubber gasket is forced to tightly contact with the tube only through tightening the coupling, the connected tube is allowed to move in the axial direction. And, if the tube moves and comes off, an internal fluid will leak. Then, if the internal fluid is hot or a hazardous chemical, it should be extremely dangerous and may lead to a serious disaster. Thus, in order to avoid such a disaster, a preventive arrangement for preventing the tube from coming off, such as always fixing the tube to a floor or a wall, is additionally required, resulting in increase in cost due to such construction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a grip ring <b>2</b>, which is produced from spring steel made of stainless steel or steel and has wedge-shaped grooves <b>1</b> in the circumferential direction of the inner face thereof, has been used as one of the constitutional members for the tube connector. The tube connector having the grip rings has been disclosed in Published Japanese Translations of International Application Publication of Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-507782. It will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>3</b> denotes a rotatable connecting piece, and reference numeral <b>4</b> denotes a fixed connecting piece. The grip ring <b>2</b> is tightly in contact with an inner face of the connecting piece <b>3</b>, one end of the grip ring <b>2</b> is engaged in an engaging piece <b>5</b>, and this engaging piece <b>5</b> is fixed through a fixing mechanism comprised of a bolt <b>6</b> and a nut <b>7</b>. Furthermore, a rubber gasket <b>8</b> is tightly in contact with an inner face of the connecting piece <b>4</b>. Inner diameters of the grip ring <b>2</b> and the rubber gasket <b>8</b> are formed to be slightly larger than an outer diameter of the tube to be inserted into this connector. If a tube is inserted into the tube connector from both sides, the bolt <b>6</b> is removed from the nut <b>7</b>, and the engaging piece <b>5</b> is pulled out, then, in response to a spring action of the grip ring <b>2</b>, wedge-shaped grooves <b>1</b> would bite into the tube and thereby inhibit the movement of the tube in the axial direction. Furthermore, the connecting piece <b>3</b> is turned around along an inner face of the connecting piece <b>4</b>, and the connecting piece <b>3</b> and the connecting piece <b>4</b> are then tightly connected by means of the bolt <b>6</b> and the nut <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">In this way, the use of the connector having the grip rings makes it possible to inhibit the movement of the tube in the axial direction and fix it tightly. These grip rings have been conventionally produced in the following way.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The producing method comprises the following steps: winding up metallic wire with predetermined shape; in a coil shape; cutting out a predetermined length of the metallic wire from the metallic wire wound in the coil shape; “bending” the cut-out portion of the metallic wire to be ring shaped; “welding” together both ends of the ring-shaped metallic wire so as to turn the blended metallic wire to be topic-shaped; performing “strain relieving annealing” to eliminate the thermal strain associated with the welding; performing “machine cutting” to provide wedge-shaped grooves on the inner face of the topic-shaped metallic wire in the circumferential direction by use of a lathe turning machine or the like; “cutting the welded portion” to obtain a ring piece which is a discrete entity from the topic-shaped metallic wire which is a continuous entity; and performing “cut treatment” on both ends of the ring piece to complete the work.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">As described above, the conventional producing method of the grip rings requires many process steps. Furthermore, the steps of welding, annealing for relieving the strain, and cutting the welded portion are extra steps in view of forming the wedge-shaped grooves and hence not necessary. Another problem is that the material is not efficiently utilized because the welded portion is cut off. What is worse, there is a drawback that the value of finished products is lowered since the welding and the annealing for relieving the'strain cause the surface to be oxidized and discolored, leading to the deterioration of the surface quality. Thus, with the conventional producing method, increase in production cost can not be avoided and the grip rings with high-quality can not be provided either.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The present invention is directed to solve the problems described above, and an object thereof is to provide metallic wire for grip rings with high surface quality and low-cost. Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide a method for effectively producing metallic wire for grip rings. Even furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus suitable for producing metallic wire for grip rings. Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide a method for effectively producing grip rings for tube connectors using metallic wire. Even furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus suitable for producing the grip rings for tube connectors. Still furthermore, the other object of the present invention is to provide the grip ring with high surface quality and low-cost for tube connectors.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">The above object, as well as other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">Hereinbelow, preferred embodiments of the present inventions will be described with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reference numeral <b>9</b> denotes metallic wire wound in a coil shape, reference numeral <b>10</b> denotes a machine cutting device (a device for producing the metallic wire for grip rings) for unwinding the metallic wire wound in the coil shape and continuously performing wedge-shape grooving on the unwound metallic wire, reference numeral <b>11</b> denotes a ring forming device for processing the metallic wire on which the wedge-shape grooving was performed to be ring-shaped, reference numeral <b>12</b> denotes a shearing device for shearing the ring-shaped metallic wire to which the ring forming was performed to produce a ring piece with predetermined length. Shearing device <b>12</b> is incorporated into the ring forming device <b>11</b>. Reference numeral <b>13</b> denotes a cutting device (for example, a milling machine) for performing cutting treatment on both ends of the ring piece with predetermined length. The machine cutting device <b>10</b> is in detail shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and the ring forming device <b>11</b> is in detail shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">Material for the metallic wire, if it is used for the grip rings, is preferably stainless steel wire for spring (especially, SUS304-WPB prescribed in JIS-G-4314). Its tensile strength is preferably 500 to 2000 N/mm<sup>2</sup>,although it depends on the wire diameter. If it is below 500 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, it is not strong enough and if it is above 2000 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, there arise a problem that it is difficult to insert a tube into a connector.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">Furthermore, the diameter of the metallic wire for grip rings can be 2 to 20 mm. Even furthermore, before being wound in a coil shape at continuous machine cutting, the metallic wire for grip rings would be straightened by a straightening process (a machining process to straighten it through upper and lower or left and right shape correction rollers) such that its deflection (the amount of deflection from its straight line) is preferably kept below 20 mm/m. If the deflection exceeds 20 mm/m, there arise a problem that machine cutting of poor quality is generated by small amplitude of vibration during machine cutting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, reference numeral <b>14</b> denotes a shape correction unit, comprised of two pairs of upper and lower shape correction rollers <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>16</b> and two pairs of left and right shape correction rollers <b>17</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>. The other of the left or right shape correction roller <b>17</b> or <b>18</b> is provided at the opposite side (not shown, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). It is preferable that these shape correction rollers, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>), have shapes conforming to an outer shape of a circular section of the metallic wire <b>34</b>. While this shape correction unit is comprised of two pairs of upper and lower shape correction rollers and two pairs of left and right shape correction rollers, it may be comprised of a pair of upper and lower shape correction rollers and a pair of left and right shape correction rollers. Alternatively, a method in which material to be corrected is passed between rollers so as to correct the shape of the material, that is, a roller leveler, can-also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, reference numerals <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> respectively denote an upper pressing roller and a lower pressing roller which are provided forward of the cutting roller unit. It is preferable that these upper and lower pressing rollers, similarly to the shape correction rollers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), have shapes conforming to the outer shape of the circular section of the metallic wire <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, reference numeral <b>21</b> denotes a first cubing roller, reference numeral <b>22</b> denotes a first support roller, reference numeral <b>23</b> denotes a second cutting roller, and reference numeral <b>24</b> denotes a second support roller. In the present embodiment, there are provided two pairs of cutting roller units. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a cutting blade <b>25</b> is formed on outer peripheral faces of the first cutting roller <b>21</b> and the second cutting roller <b>23</b> so as to perform the wedge-shape grooving on the metallic wire <b>34</b>. Furthermore, it is preferable that the first support roller <b>22</b> and the second support roller <b>24</b>, similarly to the shape correction rollers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), have shapes conforming to the outer shape of the circular section of the metallic wire <b>34</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a first cutting roller and a second cutting roller, in some cases, only one cutting roller may be needed and in other cases, three or more cutting rollers may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, reference numerals <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> denote the upper pressing roller and the lower pressing roller which are provided backward of the cutting roller unit. It is preferable that these upper and lower pressing rollers, similarly to the shape correcting rollers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), have shapes conforming to the outer shape of the circular section of the metallic wire <b>34</b>. Furthermore, it is possible to install upper and lower pressing rollers between the first cutting roller <b>21</b> and the second cutting roller <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, reference numeral <b>28</b> denotes a motor, and reference numeral <b>29</b> denotes an inverter which controls the speed of the motor <b>28</b>. Reference numeral <b>30</b> denotes a timing belt, reference numeral <b>31</b> denotes a intermediate gear, reference numeral <b>32</b> denotes a transmission belt, and reference numeral <b>33</b> denotes an operation board.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the ring forming device for processing the metallic wire <b>35</b> to which the wedge-shape grooving was performed to be ring-shaped is comprised of a metallic wire introducing appliance <b>36</b>, a first guiding member <b>37</b>, a first movable roller <b>38</b>, a second movable roller <b>39</b>, and a third movable roller <b>40</b>. These movable rollers can be moved to regulate the diameter of ring by an operation unit (not shown) in the direction of the arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">Metallic wire produced by means of the above producing apparatus of metallic wire for grip rings of the present invention can be processed to produce the grip rings for tube connectors by means of the ring forming device, the shearing device, and the machine cutting device as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">The metallic wire wound in a coil shape is unwound and then the machine cutting is continuously performed on the unwound metallic wire by means of the machine cutting device. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the unwound metallic wire <b>34</b> goes through the shape correction unit <b>14</b> so as to correct and straighten the metallic wire deformed in a coil shape. Furthermore, while the upper and lower pressing rollers <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> prevent the metallic wire <b>34</b> from warping upwardly and downwardly and the first support roller <b>22</b> and the second support roller <b>24</b> support the metallic wire <b>34</b>, the wedge-shape grooves are continuously formed on the metallic wire <b>34</b> by means of the first cutting roller <b>21</b> and the second cutting roller <b>23</b>. Functions expected by these pressing rollers are controlling a passing line of the metallic wire, controlling a travel speed of the metallic wire by controlling a rotational speed of the lower pressing rollers <b>20</b>, <b>27</b>, and preventing vibration associated with the cutting process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">The force to be used for clamping the metallic wire through the upper and lower pressing rollers is preferably higher than 10 N/cm<sup>2</sup>. However, since too much of the clamping force may make it difficult to control the moving speed of the metallic wire and, in some cases, result in the plastic deformation of the metallic wire, the clamping force should be preferably kept below 1000 N/cm<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, although as one way of contacting the pressing rollers with the metallic wire, the metallic wire <b>34</b> can be most stably clamped through the pressing rollers contacting with a curved surface of the metallic wire <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), any other ways of contacting the pressing rollers with the metallic wire, such as clamping through each of the upper pressing roller <b>41</b> and the lower pressing roller <b>42</b> contacting with a plurality of points on the metallic wire <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) or clamping through each of the upper pressing roller <b>43</b> and the lower pressing roller <b>44</b> contacting with a point on the metallic wire <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>), can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">Furthermore, the distance between a center of the cutting roller and a center of each of the pressing rollers located forward and rearward of the cutting roller would be preferably shorter so as to obtain the effect described above. However, since if the distance is too long, the above effect can not be obtained the distance between a center of the cutting roller and a center of each of the pressing rollers located forward and rearward of the cutting roller would be preferably kept below 300 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">The above metallic wire with the wedge-shape grooves is processed to be ring-shaped through the ring forming device. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the metallic wire <b>35</b> with a specific ring diameter can be realized by moving the first, the second and the third movable rollers <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>40</b> through the metallic wire introducing appliance <b>36</b> and the first guiding member <b>37</b> in the direction of the arrow. Among these movable rollers, the first movable roller <b>38</b> and the second movable roller <b>39</b> serve primarily to control the ring diameter and the third movable roller <b>40</b> serves primarily to decrease a variation of out-of-roundness and remove an internal stress. Then, the ring-shaped metallic wire is cut into a ring piece with predetermined length by means of the shearing device <b>12</b> incorporated into the ring forming device <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053">The grip ring <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is obtained by performing the cutting treatment on both ends of the ring piece by means of the cutting device <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The grip ring for the tube connectors according to the present invention does not have problems such as the surface oxidization and the surface discoloration coming from the welding process and the strain relieving annealing process which are required by the conventional producing method, and the surface is thus of high quality.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">Although, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, both of the first cutting roller <b>21</b> and the second cutting roller <b>23</b> are cutting the metallic wire <b>34</b> from the above, the cutting rollers can be disposed so that a cutting roller <b>45</b> located upward of the metallic wire <b>34</b> first cut an upper portion of the metallic wire <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>), and another cutting roller <b>46</b> located laterally to the metallic wire <b>34</b> then cut a side portion of the metallic wire <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>). Furthermore, if a need arises, after cutting the upper portion and one side portion of the metallic wire <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>), another cutting roller (not shown) located laterally oppositely to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>) of the metallic wire <b>34</b> can cut the other side portion of the metallic wire <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">Furthermore, the metallic wire <b>34</b> can be cut in a multiple-step as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>c</i>). In this way, cutting metallic wire in a multiple-step can decrease the amount of the metallic wire to be cut per one step, thereby reducing the deformation stress of the metallic wire. Therefore, it is possible to increase the speed of the metallic wire passing through the cutting device (resulting in increase in the cutting efficiency). It should be noted that the number of cutting steps can be, if a need arises, more than 3 instead of 3 steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, to prevent the metallic material <b>34</b> from warping during a cutting process, while the metallic wire <b>34</b> is tightly clamped by the upper and lower pressing rollers <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> from the above and below, the cutting roller <b>49</b> located laterally to the metallic wire <b>34</b> can cut the metallic wire <b>34</b>. Reference numeral <b>50</b> denotes a motor, and a driving sprocket <b>51</b> which is directly coupled to the motor <b>50</b> and a driven sprocket <b>52</b> are connected to each other by a belt <b>53</b>. When the motor <b>50</b> rotates, the rotation is transmitted from the sprocket <b>51</b> through the sprocket <b>52</b> and a transmission shaft <b>54</b> to the cutting roller <b>49</b> via the belt <b>53</b> so as to continuously cut the metallic wire <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057">In the cutting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first cutting roller <b>21</b>, the second cutting roller <b>23</b>, and the upper pressing rollers <b>19</b>, <b>26</b> are driving rollers, and the other rollers are driven rollers. In this case, a driving pinch roller for feeding metallic wire can be provided forward of the cutting device, and a driving pinch roller for pulling out the metallic wire can be provided rearward of the cutting device. The driving pinch roller for feeding the metallic wire and the driving pinch roller for pulling out the metallic wire have an advantage of stability of speed by which the metallic wire pass the cutting device.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">While, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ring forming device <b>11</b> is provided rearward of the cutting device <b>10</b> in series, the ring forming device <b>11</b> may be separately provided. In other words, after the machine cutting is continuously performed on the metallic wire by means of the machine cutting device and the processed metallic wire is rewound in a coil shape, then this coil-shaped metallic wire is unwound and processed to be ring-shaped by means of the ring forming device separately provided, followed by shearing the ring-shaped metallic wire into the ring piece with predetermined length.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0059">Numerous modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the forgoing description. Accordingly, the description is to be construed as illustrative only, and is provided for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the invention. The details of the structure and/or function may be varied substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
