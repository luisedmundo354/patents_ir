<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An amplifier circuit amplifies a signal inputted from an input terminal. A first feedback circuit is placed across an emitter of a bipolar transistor and an input of the amplifier circuit. A second feedback circuit is placed across the input and an output of the amplifier circuit for feeding the output of the amplifier circuit back to the input of the amplifier circuit. A phase change amount in the feedback circuit is determined by the values of an inductor and a capacitor. The values of these elements are selected so that a phase of a signal in which fundamental waves included in two feedback signals are combined and a phase of a signal in which second harmonics included in the two feedback signals are combined are shifted by approximately 180 degrees from a phase of a fundamental wave of an input signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to amplifiers for amplifying an input signal, and frequency converters for amplifying an input signal and then converting the frequency of the amplified signal. More specifically, the present invention relates to an amplifier and a frequency converter both having a wide dynamic range and suitable for integration into a semiconductor integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In receivers of a wireless system, typified by cellular phones, a signal received at an antenna is amplified by an amplifier circuit at an initial stage. Such an initial-stage amplifier circuit is required to have characteristics of achieving low noise and high gain when receiving a weak signal, while achieving low distortion and low gain when receiving a large signal. Particularly, in recent mobile communications, since the characteristics of a reception electric field are greatly varied in accordance with a distance between a base station and a mobile station, a wider dynamic range is required than ever in a receiving system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to stabilize the operation of the amplifier circuit, a widely used scheme is inserting a resistance between a signal line and the ground at the input or output of the amplifier circuit. However, insertion of the resistance at the input side causes severe degradation in noise characteristics. Insertion of the resistance at the output side, on the other hand, causes severe degradation in distortion characteristics. Other known schemes for stabilizing the operation of the amplifier circuit include a scheme of applying negative feedback to the input. That is, in this scheme, a signal shifted in phase by 180 degrees is fed back to the input. According to this scheme, it is possible to achieve an amplifier circuit generally having a wide dynamic range, although noise and distortion characteristics are both slightly degraded. Better still, a negative feedback circuit used in this scheme can also operate as a distortion compensator circuit, thereby making the dynamic range still wider with some contrivances of the circuit configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 through 20</figref>, six conventional negative feedback amplifiers are exemplarily described. A first conventional example is a “negative feedback power amplifier” disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-22751 (1998-22751) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> includes a negative feedback circuit which is capable of operating as a distortion compensator circuit and is used in a microwave band. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, transistors <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> are both field-effect transistors. Inductors <b>603</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>605</b>, and capacitors <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> form a matching circuit for the transistors <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>. A microstrip line <b>608</b> serves as a phase shifter. A power voltage Vcc is applied via the microstrip line <b>608</b> to the amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Part of an output signal from the transistor <b>602</b> is fed via the inductor <b>605</b>, the microstrip line <b>608</b>, and then the inductor <b>604</b> back to the input of the transistor <b>601</b>. Here, a length L of the microstrip line <b>608</b> is adjusted so that the feedback signal and the output signal from the transistor <b>602</b> are different in phase from each other by 180 degrees. With part of the output signal including a distortion component being inverted in phase for feedback to the input, distortion characteristics in a high frequency band can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A second conventional example is a “high-output amplifier” disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 6-216670 (1994-216670) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). The amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> includes strip lines <b>701</b><i>a </i>and <b>701</b><i>b </i>as signal lines, a signal-amplifying transistor <b>702</b>, a directional coupler <b>703</b>, a feedback strip line <b>704</b>, a stub <b>705</b>, resistances <b>706</b><i>a </i>and <b>706</b><i>b </i>for changing the amount of feedback, a level detector circuit <b>707</b>, a harmonic suppression controller circuit <b>708</b>, and a terminator resistance <b>709</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an input supplied via the signal-line strip line <b>701</b><i>a </i>is amplified by the signal-amplifying transistor <b>702</b>.

As such, with the distortion of the second harmonic being cancelled, the linearity of the signal-amplifying transistor <b>702</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third conventional example is an “amplifier” disclosed in PCT International Publication No. WO96/25791 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). The amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> includes a transistor <b>801</b>, signal sources <b>802</b> and <b>803</b>, a signal source resistance <b>804</b>, an input matching circuit composed of components denoted by reference numerals <b>805</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>807</b>, <b>808</b> and <b>809</b>, an output matching circuit composed of components denoted by reference numerals <b>810</b>, <b>811</b> and <b>815</b>, a band-pass filter <b>812</b>, a phase shifter <b>813</b>, a variable attenuator <b>814</b>, and a load resistance <b>816</b>.</p>

The phase shifter <b>813</b> and the variable attenuator <b>814</b> adjust the phase and amplitude of the second harmonic, respectively. In this amplifier, as with the second conventional example, the second harmonic of the output signal is fed back to the input, thereby reducing the third-order intermodulation product of the amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A fourth conventional example is a “power amplifier” disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 7-94954 (1995-94954) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> includes a combiner <b>901</b>, a power amplifier <b>902</b>, a divider <b>903</b>, a filter <b>904</b>, a variable phase shifter <b>905</b>, and a variable attenuator <b>906</b>. This amplifier phase-shifts a fundamental wave and higher order waves (a second or third- or fourth-order harmonic, etc.) of the output from the power amplifier <b>902</b> by 180 degrees in a wide band, and the resultant wave is fed back to the input of the power amplifier <b>902</b>. As such, with the fundamental wave and the second harmonic of the output from the power amplifier <b>902</b> being negatively fed back to the input, it is possible to compensate for distortion of the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A fifth conventional example is a “wide-band feedback amplifier” disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 10-335954 (1998-335954) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).

As with the fourth conventional example, this amplifier shifts the phase of the output from the amplifying device <b>1001</b> by 180 degrees in a wide band, and then feeds the results back to the input of the amplifying device <b>1001</b>. As such, with the fundamental wave and the second harmonic of the output from the amplifying device <b>1001</b> being negatively fed back to the input, it is possible to compensate for distortion of the output signal. The gazette of this publication discloses a specific example of a feedback circuit for phase shift by 180 degrees in a wide band.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A sixth conventional example is a “broadband amplification with high linearity and low power consumption” disclosed in PCT International Publication No. WO00/45505 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). The amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> includes an input transistor <b>1101</b>, an output transistor <b>1102</b>, a series reactive feedback network <b>1103</b>, and a shunt reactive feedback network <b>1104</b>. The input transistor <b>1101</b> and the output transistor <b>1102</b> are coupled in a cascode configuration with the input transistor defining an input of the amplifier and the output transistor defining an output of the amplifier. The shunt reactive feedback network <b>1104</b> is coupled between the input and the output and is characterized by an impedance of substantially zero resistance and non-zero reactance. With the above-described circuit configuration, it is possible to improve distortion characteristics without degrading noise characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, the above first through sixth conventional examples have a drawback that due to only one type of shunt feedback path being provided for each conventional example, the feedback circuit is complex in structure and large in size in order to shift the feedback signal in phase by approximately 180 degrees with respect to the input signal. Further, in the amplifier of the first conventional example, the second harmonic is shifted in phase by almost 360 degrees for feedback to the input. Therefore, this amplifier does not perform distortion compensation by negative feedback of the second harmonic. In the amplifiers of the second and third conventional examples, the fundamental wave is barely fed back. Therefore, these amplifiers do not perform distortion compensation by negative feedback of the third-order intermodulation wave occurring at a frequency in the vicinity of the frequency of the fundamental wave. Furthermore, in the amplifiers of the fourth and fifth conventional examples, a process of phase adjustment made to both of the fundamental wave and the harmonic is performed only by the feedback circuit, thereby making the feedback circuit complex in structure and large in size.</p>

Such a feedback section is composed of an inductor, or a circuit in which an inductor and a capacitor are connected to each other in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Also, as the in-phase amplifying section and the opposite-phase amplifying section, a circuit including a first bipolar transistor having a base and an emitter, the base being connected to the input and the emitter being connected to either the in-phase feedback terminal or the opposite-phase feedback terminal; and a second bipolar transistor having an emitter being connected to a collector of the first bipolar transistor and having a collector being connected to the output, or a circuit including a bipolar transistor having a base being connected to the input, having an emitter being connected to either the in-phase feedback terminal or the opposite-phase feedback terminal, and having a collector being connected to the output is used.

A vector addition for calculating a synthesis signal of the feedback signals as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref> (hereinafter, referred to as a synthesis feedback signal) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, the synthesis feedback signal includes (S<sub>1a</sub>+S<sub>1b</sub>) as a fundamental wave component, and (S<sub>2a</sub>+S<sub>2b</sub>) as a second harmonic component.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The circuit as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> has two feedback paths. As a result, by appropriately selecting the values of the inductor <b>201</b>, the capacitors <b>202</b> and <b>302</b>, and the resistance <b>301</b>, it is possible to shift the phase of the fundamental wave (S<sub>1a</sub>+S<sub>1b</sub>) included in the synthesis feedback signal and the phase of the second harmonic (S<sub>2a</sub>+S<sub>2b</sub>) included in the synthesis feedback signal from the phase of the fundamental wave S<sub>0 </sub>of the input signal by approximately 180 degrees as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, the amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can feed the second harmonic shifted in phase by 180 degrees back to the input. That is, the second harmonic can be negatively fed back to the input. Furthermore, the frequency of the third-order intermodulation wave is adjacent to the frequency of the fundamental wave. Therefore, the amplifier of the present embodiment can feed the third-order intermodulation wave shifted in phase by 180 degrees back to the input. That is, the third-order intermodulation wave can be negatively fed back to the input.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As such, in the amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the passing phase of the first feedback circuit <b>20</b> is adjusted by the inductor <b>201</b> and the capacitor <b>202</b>, whereas the passing phase of the second feedback circuit <b>30</b> is adjusted by the resistance <b>301</b> and the capacitor <b>302</b>. With this, it is possible to negatively feed the fundamental wave, the third-order intermodulation wave, and the second harmonic of the input signal back to the input as a synthesis vector of the outputs of the two feedback circuits. Moreover, the amplifier of the present embodiment does not use a strip line or slot line as compared with the conventional amplifiers. Therefore, the amplifier can be easily integrated, even if being used in a microwave band, into a semiconductor integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, according to the amplifier of the present embodiment, the first feedback circuit <b>20</b> and the second feedback circuit <b>30</b> are used so as to appropriately adjust the phase of the feedback signal. With this, it is possible to achieve, on the entire amplifier, negative feedback of the fundamental wave, the third-order intermodulation wave, and the second harmonic of the input signal. Thus, a high-frequency negative feedback amplifier having a wide dynamic range can be achieved with a simple structure.</p>

Therefore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, components similar to those according to the second embodiment are provided with the same reference numerals, and are not described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first feedback circuit <b>26</b> includes inductors <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>201</b><i>b </i>and <b>203</b>, and capacitors <b>202</b><i>a </i>and <b>202</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5F</figref>, the operation of the amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be described below. The first feedback circuit <b>26</b> is supplied with a differential signal. Therefore, at the connecting point Q<b>2</b>, two input signals are cancelled by each other. The potential at the connecting point Q<b>2</b> is always 0 even though the input signals are alternating-current signals. Therefore, the passing phase of a fundamental wave component of the output signal is not influenced by the inductor <b>203</b>. Here, the second harmonic component of the output signal can be represented by using an angular velocity of ω, as cos(2ωt) for a non-inverted signal and as cos{2(ωt+π)}=cos(2ωt) for an inverted signal. Therefore, it is evident that the non-inverted signal and the inverted signal are in phase. For this reason, the passing phase of the second harmonic component of the output signal is delayed by the influence of the inductor <b>203</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">An input terminal P<b>2</b>+ is connected via the DC cut capacitor <b>504</b><i>a </i>to the base of the bipolar transistor <b>401</b>, whereas an input terminal P<b>2</b>− is connected via the DC cut capacitor <b>504</b><i>b </i>to the base of the bipolar transistor <b>402</b>. The capacitor <b>404</b> is inserted between the collectors of the bipolar transistors <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> for reducing a leak of the second harmonic of a local signal to the output terminals P<b>3</b>+ and P<b>3</b>−.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In normal use, the input terminal P<b>1</b> is supplied with an RF (Radio Frequency) signal received by an antenna and then amplified by a low-noise amplifier. The input terminals P<b>2</b>+ and P<b>2</b>− are supplied with a LO (Local Oscillator) signal supplied by a local oscillator. Output from the output terminals P<b>3</b>+ and P<b>3</b>− is an IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal mainly including a signal of an intermediate frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As with the amplifier according to the first embodiment, the frequency converter as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can feed back the fundamental signal and the second harmonic that have been shifted in phase by 180 degrees of the RF signal supplied by the input terminal P<b>1</b>. That is, the fundamental signal and the second harmonic can be negatively fed back to the input. Moreover, the frequency of the third-order intermodulation wave is adjacent to the frequency of the fundamental wave. Therefore, the frequency converter can feed the third-order intermodulation wave shifted in phase by 180 degrees back to the input. That is, the third-order intermodulation wave can be negatively fed back to the input.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As such, in the frequency converter as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the passing phase of the first feedback circuit <b>20</b> is adjusted by the inductor <b>201</b> and the capacitor <b>202</b>, whereas the passing phase of the second feedback circuit <b>30</b> is adjusted by the resistance <b>301</b> and the capacitor <b>302</b>. Therefore, it is possible to achieve negative feedback of the fundamental wave, the third-order intermodulation wave, and the second harmonic of the input signal to the input with a simple structure. Moreover, the frequency converter of the present embodiment does not use a strip line or slot line as compared with conventional frequency converters. Therefore, the frequency converter can be easily integrated, even if being used in a microwave band, into a semiconductor integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, conventional frequency converters have a drawback in which the second harmonic of the LO signal occurring at the frequency converter circuit affects the operation of the amplifier circuit. By contrast, in the frequency converter as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first feedback circuit <b>20</b> is adjusted so that the second harmonic of the LO signal occurring at the frequency converter circuit <b>40</b> is shifted in phase by 180 degrees by the first feedback circuit <b>20</b> and the amplifier circuit <b>10</b> for output to the frequency converter circuit <b>40</b>. As a result, it is possible to reduce the level of the second harmonic of the LO signal occurring at the frequency converter circuit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described above, according to the frequency converter of the present embodiment, the first feedback circuit <b>20</b> and the second feedback circuit <b>30</b> are used to appropriately adjust the phase of the feedback signal, thereby achieving, on the entire frequency converter, negative feedback of the fundamental wave, the third-order intermodulation wave, and the second harmonic of the input signal. Therefore, a high-frequency negative feedback frequency converter having a wide dynamic range can be achieved with a simple structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Modifications of Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Exemplary modifications of the amplifiers according to the first through fourth embodiments and the frequency converters according to the fifth through eighth embodiments are described below. The amplifiers and the frequency converters described below have effects similar to those of the amplifiers and frequency converters that have been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">First, each of the second feedback circuit <b>30</b> and <b>35</b> as shown in each embodiment can be replaced by another feedback circuit. For example, such a feedback circuit can be formed by using any of three circuits as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</figref>. A circuit <b>31</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes a resistance <b>311</b> and capacitors <b>312</b> and <b>313</b>. The resistance <b>311</b> and the capacitor <b>312</b> are connected to each other in series to form a series circuit, to which the capacitor <b>313</b> is connected in parallel. A circuit <b>32</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> includes capacitors <b>321</b> and <b>322</b>, and a resistance <b>323</b>. The capacitors <b>321</b> and <b>322</b> are connected to each other in series, and their connecting point S<b>1</b> is grounded via the resistance <b>323</b>. A circuit <b>33</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> includes capacitors <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>, and an inductor <b>333</b>. The capacitors <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> are connected in series, and their connecting point S<b>2</b> is grounded via the inductor <b>333</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Consider a case where the feedback circuit as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is used to form the amplifier according to the first embodiment. In this case, a terminal P<b>7</b> is connected to the base of the bipolar transistor <b>101</b>, whereas a terminal P<b>8</b> is connected to the collector of the bipolar transistor <b>102</b>. The same goes for cases in which any of the feedback circuits as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</figref> is used to form the amplifier according to the embodiments other than the first embodiment. Note that the second feedback circuit <b>35</b>, which is structured by a differential pair, can be formed by using a pair of two circuits, both identical to one of three circuits as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Also, in the feedback circuit as illustrated in each embodiment, a feedback signal may vary in amplitude and phase depending on, for instance, a level of an input signal. For example, a variable-capacitance diode (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) may be replaced by the capacitor in the feedback circuit. In the amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a first feedback circuit <b>29</b> includes a variable-capacitance diode <b>252</b>, whereas a second feedback circuit <b>39</b> includes a variable-capacitance diode <b>352</b>. Voltages of impedance control signals Vct<b>11</b> and Vct<b>12</b> change with a level of an input signal, for example. A change in the voltage of the impedance control signal Vct<b>11</b> causes the capacitance value of the variable-capacitance diode <b>352</b> to change, whereas a change in the voltage of the impedance control signal Vct<b>12</b> causes the capacitance value of the variable-capacitance diode <b>252</b> to change. As a result, a feedback signal varies in amplitude and phase. With this, it is possible to control the amplifier circuit so that high gain and low IIP3 (3<sup>rd </sup>Input Intercept Point) are achieved when an input power is small, and control the amplifier circuit so that low gain and high IIP3 are achieved when an input power is large.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Also, instead of the cascode amplifier circuit <b>10</b> or <b>15</b> in each embodiment, an amplifier circuit having another structure can be used. For example, a single-type amplifier circuit (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) can be used. In an amplifier as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an amplifier circuit <b>11</b> includes a bipolar transistor <b>101</b> and a bias circuit <b>104</b>. The collector of the bipolar transistor <b>101</b> is connected via the DC cut capacitor <b>503</b> to the output terminal P<b>2</b>. Other than the structure of the amplifier circuit as mentioned above, the amplifier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is similar to that according to the first embodiment. With the use of such a single-type amplifier circuit, an amplifier having low noise characteristics can be achieved. The above same effects can be also achieved by applying a single-type amplifier circuit to the amplifiers and the frequency converters of other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Furthermore, the bipolar transistors as shown in each embodiment can be replaced by heterojunction bipolar transistors made of SiGe/Si, AlGaAs/GaAs, or GaInP/GaAs. Thus, it is possible to achieve an amplifier and a frequency converter having low noise and low distortion characteristics in high frequencies. Also, the bipolar transistors can be replaced by MOSFETs. Thus, with the use of low-cost CMOS process, it is possible to manufacture the amplifiers and the frequency converters according to the embodiments at low cost. Note that such replaceable bipolar transistors are those provided with reference numerals of <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>a</i>, and <b>102</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>6</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>401</b>, and <b>402</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>401</b><i>a</i>, <b>401</b><i>b</i>, <b>402</b><i>a</i>, and <b>402</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Still further, in the above embodiments, the first feedback circuits <b>20</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> are implemented by inductors and capacitors. Alternatively, instead of the inductor, a circuit in which the inductor and the capacitor are connected to each other in parallel can be used. With this, a phase control over the fundamental wave and the second harmonic can be more flexibly performed. Note that such replaceable inductors are those provided with reference numerals of <b>201</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>, <b>201</b><i>a </i>and <b>201</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>, <b>201</b><i>a</i>, <b>201</b><i>b</i>, and <b>203</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 9</figref>, and <b>204</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the above embodiments, it is preferable to implement the resistances by polysilicon, the capacitors by MOS capacitors or MIM (Metal Insulator Metal) capacitors, and the inductors by wiring layers of aluminum, copper, or gold. With this, the amplifiers and the frequency converters according to the above embodiments can be easily integrated into a semiconductor integrated circuit.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Still further, the phase of the feedback signal in the amplifiers and the frequency converters according to the above embodiments is influenced by an impedance of the signal source side seen from the device and an impedance of the load side seen from the device. Therefore, when a matching circuit is used at the input or output of the amplifiers and the frequency converters according to the above embodiments, the first and second feedback circuits have to be designed in consideration of the impedance of the matching circuit, so that a phase difference between the input signal and the feedback signal of each of the fundamental wave and the second harmonic is 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As described in the foregoing, according to the amplifiers of the first through fourth embodiments, the frequency converters of the fifth through eighth embodiments, and the exemplary modifications of the above embodiments, the passing phase of the first feedback circuit and the passing phase of the second feedback circuit are both adjusted. With this adjustment, the fundamental wave, the third-order intermodulation wave, and the second harmonic of the input signal can be negatively fed back to the input on the whole amplifier and frequency converter. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a high-frequency negative feedback amplifier and a high-frequency negative feedback frequency converter each having a wide dynamic range with a simple structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Ninth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an illustration showing a structure of a wireless terminal according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention. In a wireless terminal performing transmission and reception simultaneously, a portion of a transmission signal generated by a transmission circuit is leaked to a reception circuit when transmission is performed. At the time of transmission, an amplifier and a frequency converter included in the reception circuit are required to have a very wide dynamic range. On the other hand, when no transmission is performed, the amplifier and the frequency converter included in the reception circuit are required to consume a small current.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Thus, as the amplifier and the frequency converter included in the reception circuit, the wireless terminal according to the present embodiment includes an amplifier <b>42</b> according to the first to fourth embodiments and the modifications thereof and a frequency converter <b>80</b> according to the fifth to eighth embodiments and the modifications thereof. Also, the wireless terminal includes a control section <b>90</b> for changing consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">When a transmission start signal is received from a transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b>, the control section <b>90</b> turns a modulator <b>13</b> and an amplifier <b>41</b> ON. As a result, the level of a leakage signal leaked from the transmission circuit to the reception circuit is increased. Thus, the control section <b>90</b> performs control so as to increase the consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b> when the transmission start signal is received from the transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b> are a negative feedback amplifier and a negative feedback frequency converter, respectively. Thus, even if the consumption current is increased, the gains of the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b> are not significantly increased. As a result, it is possible to realize a wireless terminal having a wide dynamic range without a major change in the level diagram structure of the wireless terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Hereinafter, the detailed structure of the wireless terminal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> will be described.

A leakage signal leaked from the transmission circuit to the reception circuit becomes an interfering signal for the reception circuit. Also, the transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b> functions as a transmission signal generation section, and the control section <b>90</b> functions as an interfering signal determination section and a control section.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b> generates a transmission signal, and the modulator <b>13</b> modulates the transmission signal outputted from the transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described above, when a transmission start signal is received from the transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b>, the control section <b>90</b> turns the modulator <b>13</b> and the amplifier <b>410</b>N, and performs control so as to increase the consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b>. For example, the control section <b>90</b> performs control so as to increase a bias voltage of the bias circuit included in the amplifier as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or increase a bias voltage of the bias circuit included in the frequency converter as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Thus, the consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b> is increased, and the level of distortion of the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b> is increased. As such, when the level of a leakage signal leaked from the transmission circuit to the reception circuit is high, the consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b> is controlled so as to be high.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Hereinafter, a wireless receiver and a wireless reception method of the present invention will be described by describing an operation of the wireless terminal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Hereinafter, to facilitate understanding of the description, the operation of the wireless terminal will be divided into three parts: transmission, reception, and control. Note that, in actuality, these three parts are executed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">(1) Transmission</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b> generates a transmission signal, and outputs the transmission signal to the modulator <b>13</b>. The modulator <b>13</b> modulates the transmission signal outputted from the transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b>, and outputs the modulated signal to the amplifier <b>41</b>. The amplifier <b>41</b> amplifies the transmission signal outputted from the modulator <b>13</b>, and outputs the amplified signal to the isolator <b>50</b>. The isolator <b>50</b> outputs the transmission signal outputted from the amplifier <b>41</b> to the filter <b>51</b>, and prohibits a reflected signal from the filter <b>51</b> from being inputted to the amplifier <b>41</b>. The filter <b>51</b> performs filtering of the transmission signal outputted from the isolator <b>50</b>, and outputs the resultant signal to the antenna <b>9</b>. The antenna <b>9</b> transmits the transmission signal outputted from the filter <b>51</b> using wireless waves.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">(2) Reception</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The antenna <b>9</b> receives a reception signal using wireless waves, and outputs the reception signal to the filter <b>52</b>. The filter <b>52</b> performs filtering of the reception signal outputted from the antenna <b>9</b>, and outputs the resultant signal to the amplifier <b>42</b>. The amplifier <b>42</b> amplifies the reception signal outputted from the filter <b>52</b>, and outputs the amplified signal to the filter <b>53</b>. The filter <b>53</b> performs filtering of the reception signal outputted from the amplifier <b>42</b>, and outputs the resultant signal to the frequency converter <b>80</b>. The frequency converter <b>80</b> mixes the reception signal outputted from the filter <b>53</b> and a local signal (a signal generated by the signal generator <b>60</b> and amplified by the amplifier <b>70</b>), and outputs the resultant signal to the filter <b>54</b>. The filter <b>54</b> performs filtering of the reception signal outputted from the frequency converter <b>80</b>, and outputs the resultant signal to the demodulator <b>21</b>. The demodulator <b>21</b> demodulates the reception signal outputted from the filter <b>54</b>, and outputs the demodulated signal to the reception baseband circuit <b>22</b>. The reception baseband circuit <b>22</b> performs a predetermined process for the reception signal outputted from the demodulator <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">(3) Control</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">When a transmission start signal is received from the transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b>, the control section <b>90</b> turns the modulator <b>13</b> and the amplifier <b>41</b> ON, and performs control so as to increase the consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b>. Also, when a transmission termination signal is received from the transmission baseband circuit <b>12</b>, the control section <b>90</b> turns the modulator <b>13</b> and the amplifier <b>41</b> OFF, and performs control so as to reduce the consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b>. Thus, the consumption current in the amplifier <b>42</b> and the frequency converter <b>80</b> is controlled so as to be increased when the level of a leakage signal leaked from the transmission circuit to the reception circuit is high.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As described above, according to the wireless terminal of present embodiment, even if a communication scheme performing transmission and reception simultaneously (e.g., W-CDMA scheme) is adopted, it is possible to widen a dynamic range of the amplifier and the frequency converter while minimizing the increase in the consumption current. As such, it is possible to concurrently achieve a wide dynamic range and reduced consumption current.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The amplifier and the frequency converter of the present invention each have a wide dynamic range with a simple structure. Therefore, the amplifier and the frequency converter of the present invention can be used as various types of amplifiers and frequency converters such as receivers of a wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">While the invention has been described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is understood that numerous other modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
