<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method comprising a reporting mechanism for outputting an HMTL and XML document from a collection of hierarchically maintained settings such as group policy object settings or resultant set of policy data. The reporting mechanism provides a substantially complete view of which settings are configured (enabled) in a given group policy object, or a view for a resultant set of policy (that is applied to a given SOM), along with the values of the settings. The markup language format enables viewing a flat representation of the settings, and printing, saving and/or transporting of the settings. XML schemas describe a valid representation of group policy settings, and a valid representation of resultant set of policy.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates generally to computer systems and networks, and more particularly to policies used in computer networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contemporary computing networks, network administrators define policies for users and computer systems of that network. With a Microsoft Windows®-based operating system, administrators use Group Policy technology to define the state of users' work environment, and rely on the system to enforce the defined policies. In general, those policies are then applied to determine how the various computer systems are configured. For example, the configuration that a user sees when logged onto any computer system of the network depends on the policy settings for that machine combined with the policy settings for that user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a network, Group Policy can be used to specify many of the settings for a user and computer, including registry-based policy settings used to configure and specify behavior of the operating system and optionally application programs based on settings in various computer systems' registries, and script-related policy settings that control scripts for computer startup and shutdown, and user logon and logoff. Group policy can also specify particular software programs for groups of users and/or machines, as Group Policy includes settings for centrally managing the installation, updates, and removal of application programs and components. Security options are also provided by policy settings, e.g., for local computer, domain, and network security settings. Folder redirection options, which allow administrators to redirect users' special folders to the network, also may be managed via Group Policy, as can Internet Explorer Maintenance, which is used to manage settings related to Internet Explorer and Remote Installation Services options, which are used to manage client configuration options that users see when performing Remote Installation Services-based installs. Internet Protocol Security Settings and Wireless settings can also be deployed through Group Policy, and public key policy settings, as well as software restriction policies can also be managed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To apply and enforce the policy in a Windows®-based operating system, the Group Policy settings that administrators create are contained in group policy objects (GPOs). In general, a group policy object may be considered a collection of settings of various types, defined by extensions to group policy which are registered on the administrative and client systems and used to manage group policy configuration. The actual application of settings on the client, as well as administration of settings is managed by that extension. Group policy objects are applied to one or more scopes of management, such as a site, domain, or organizational unit (OU) in Active Directory®, and thus a site, domain, or organizational unit may also be referred to as a scope of management, or SOM. In this manner, administrators centrally apply policy to users and computers of those sites, domains, and organizational units. Policy settings from group policy objects that are linked to each of these different hierarchical levels are combined and applied to the policy recipients. Any conflicting policy among the levels is resolved via various rules, as generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,466,932, herein incorporated by reference. The result set is referred to as a resultant set of policy, or RSoP, which comprises the policy settings that were applied to a user or computer, as well as the group policy objects from where these settings originated (the winning GPO).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While group policy is a very powerful technology and group policy objects greatly simplify network administration, group policy objects are not simple objects, but rather virtual objects comprising complex pieces of setting definitions that are stored on the domain. In general, each group policy object comprises multiple subcomponents, typically including a collection of many files, other objects and attributes, that reference one another in various ways. For example, in one Windows®-based implementation, a group policy object comprises some settings stored within an Active Directory® container, as well as in a file system directory (sysvol) on the domain controllers within the group policy object's host domain.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Managing Group Policy in an enterprise environment requires an understanding multiple complex sets of data, simultaneously. For example, to understand which computers and users will receive and apply the settings in a given group policy object, the administrator has to access and understand multiple sets of information. In addition, multiple group policy objects can apply to a single user and/or a computer. To manage this complexity and understand the relationships of group policy objects and the directory, an MMC snap-in, the Group Policy Management Console, is provided. This snap-in allows the administrator to work with group policy objects as a unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, a group policy object is a collection of multiple settings. To edit and configure those settings within a single group policy object, a second Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Snap-in, Group Policy Object Editor (GPEdit) is provided, which (for convenience) is launchable from the Group Policy Management Console. With GPEdit, the group policy object is displayed hierarchically on a left side (pane), with details for a selected item in displayed on a right side (pane).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in part because of the restrictive view in which this is presented and controlled through MMC snap-ins, it is very difficult to administer a group policy object's settings. More particularly, the snap-in view generally restricts the administrator to viewing a small number of settings at a time, since the settings are organized within a folder structure, and thus makes it very difficult to determine what settings are configured. For example, there are a large number of settings in a group policy object or resultant set of policy for a policy recipient, on the order of one-thousand, however typically only a few (e.g., ten to twenty) may be configured for a given user. The administrator may need to manage these settings, but does not know which of the many settings are enabled. To determine which are enabled, the administrator has to navigate through a large hierarchy of settings. Further, the displayed data is limited to the snap-in environment and requires connectivity to the domain, and, for example, cannot be exported into a form usable by other programs, nor can it be printed. One further drawback of viewing settings in an editing program is that the viewer needs to have write access to the group policy object.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Briefly, the present invention provides a system and method comprising a reporting mechanism that outputs a collection of hierarchically maintained settings as one or more markup language documents, for example an XML and/or HTML document. Because of the nature of these markup language formats, the subsequent processing makes it straightforward to operate on the data for reporting purposes. For example, the XML format enables further manipulations and queries, while the HTML format comprises a standardized format that can be rendered into human readable form by a web browser or other types of document viewers and editors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When used in the Group Policy Management Console in MMC, the reporting mechanism enables a collection of group policy settings to be viewed, printed or otherwise processed from the markup language documents. When rendered on a viewer, the mechanism provides a substantially complete view of which settings are configured (enabled) in a given group policy object, or a view for a resultant set of policy (that is applied to a given SOM or a specific user or computer), along with the values of the settings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various mapping rules are provided to convert the hierarchically arranged settings data, including data previously accessible through property dialogs accessed from a treeview, into an HTML representation of the settings. The HTML representation may be expanded and contracted in an interactive manner as desired by a user, to quickly navigate to view desired settings. Read-only access is sufficient to view and interact with the HTML document.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To facilitate the output of the data related to group policy, the present invention includes two XML schemas, one describing a valid representation of group policy settings, and the other describing a valid representation of resultant set of policy. The schemas provide a foundation for further processing of the XML view of group policy data. Group policy objects as well as resultant set of policy data can be represented in XML and HTML.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one implementation, an architecture is provided to collect group policy object settings, and translate or serialize those settings into output markup language documents, based on .net objects and XML schemas. For group policy objects, a group policy object read and translate mechanism reads the settings for a group policy object, comprising a combination of directory service settings and sysvol settings. A reporting mechanism, such as implemented in a single .net assembly, uses mapping information to persist the settings into an HTML representation, and may use a localized string table to render the group policy object's HTML representation output in an appropriate language. The reporting mechanism also leverages an XML serializer to persist the settings into an XML document. RSoP settings are similarly processed, e.g., by initializing the various net class objects from a WMI repository, translating into HTML and serializing into XML.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In sum, by reading the group policy object settings from their disparate (e.g., DS and sysvol) component locations, or by reading settings from a WMI namespace, an XML document which conforms to the corresponding group policy object schema or RSoP schema, as appropriate, may be produced by utilizing an XML serializer. For generating HTML documents, the group policy object and RSoP root elements, as well as each extension, implement an appropriate method for persisting their settings into a statically defined HTML format with which a viewer can interact.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The invention may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and so forth, which perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in local and/or remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer <b>110</b>. Components of the computer <b>110</b> may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit <b>120</b>, a system memory <b>130</b>, and a system bus <b>121</b> that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The computer <b>110</b> typically includes a variety of computer-readable media. Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer <b>110</b> and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, and removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can accessed by the computer <b>110</b>. Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term “modulated data signal” means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of the any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The system memory <b>130</b> includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) <b>131</b> and random access memory (RAM) <b>132</b>. A basic input/output system <b>133</b> (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer <b>110</b>, such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM <b>131</b>. RAM <b>132</b> typically contains data and/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and/or presently being operated on by processing unit <b>120</b>. By way of example, and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates operating system <b>134</b>, application programs <b>135</b>, other program modules <b>136</b> and program data <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The computer <b>110</b> may also include other removable/non-removable, volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a hard disk drive <b>141</b> that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive <b>151</b> that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk <b>152</b>, and an optical disk drive <b>155</b> that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk <b>156</b> such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable/non-removable, volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive <b>141</b> is typically connected to the system bus <b>121</b> through a non-removable memory interface such as interface <b>140</b>, and magnetic disk drive <b>151</b> and optical disk drive <b>155</b> are typically connected to the system bus <b>121</b> by a removable memory interface, such as interface <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The drives and their associated computer storage media, discussed above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, provide storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer <b>110</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, hard disk drive <b>141</b> is illustrated as storing operating system <b>144</b>, application programs <b>145</b>, other program modules <b>146</b> and program data <b>147</b>. Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system <b>134</b>, application programs <b>135</b>, other program modules <b>136</b>, and program data <b>137</b>. Operating system <b>144</b>, application programs <b>145</b>, other program modules <b>146</b>, and program data <b>147</b> are given different numbers herein to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into the computer <b>110</b> through input devices such as a tablet, or electronic digitizer, <b>164</b>, a microphone <b>163</b>, a keyboard <b>162</b> and pointing device <b>161</b>, commonly referred to as mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit <b>120</b> through a user input interface <b>160</b> that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor <b>191</b> or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus <b>121</b> via an interface, such as a video interface <b>190</b>. The monitor <b>191</b> may also be integrated with a touch-screen panel or the like. Note that the monitor and/or touch screen panel can be physically coupled to a housing in which the computing device <b>110</b> is incorporated, such as in a tablet-type personal computer. In addition, computers such as the computing device <b>110</b> may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers <b>195</b> and printer <b>196</b>, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface <b>194</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The computer <b>110</b> may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer <b>180</b>. The remote computer <b>180</b> may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer <b>110</b>, although only a memory storage device <b>181</b> has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The logical connections depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> include a local area network (LAN) <b>171</b> and a wide area network (WAN) <b>173</b>, but may also include other networks.

In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer <b>110</b>, or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates remote application programs <b>185</b> as residing on memory device <b>181</b>. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Group Policy Objects</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In general, the present invention provides a method and system for operating on policies implemented throughout a network, wherein those policies are defined and arranged (e.g., by one or more administrators) into group policy objects. Group policy objects generally comprise a collection of files, objects and attributes that exist at various locations in the network. Such policy may correspond to policy settings in the group policy objects, including registry-based settings, scripts, (computer startup and shutdown scripts, and user logon and logoff scripts), redirection of folders that contain user documents and settings, application deployment (software installation), security settings, public key policy settings, software restriction policies, IP security, remote installation services, and/or Internet Explorer Maintenance. Indeed, group policy objects may be extended to include virtually any desired information, as long as a client-side (or other) extension that uses the policy object is capable of interpreting and/or handling the information therein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an example implementation described herein, the system and method of operating on group policy utilize a highly flexible architecture of the Microsoft Windows® operating system, in which an administrator links the group policy objects to the containers, which comprise hierarchically organized directory objects representing sites, domains and organizational units, with policy recipients (e.g., users and computers) being associated with those containers. In this implementation, generally represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the group policy objects preferably utilize a Windows® directory service (e.g., in components <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>), known as Active Directory®, which stores information about the objects of a domain, and makes this information easy for administrators to access, find and apply via a single, consistent and open set of interfaces. Note that each domain controller has a directory service component, with data replicated to other directory service components, but for purposes of the examples the directory service will be described with reference to the directory service component <b>202</b>. Thus, for example, with the Active Directory® service <b>202</b>, administrators can access resources anywhere on the network. Similarly, administrators have a single point of administration for the objects on the network, which can be viewed in a hierarchical structure. Each domain controller also has a sysvol component (that is, a distributed file system component, networked file system component, file storage component or the like) that is similarly replicated, typically for maintaining larger sets of data (relative to the size of the sets of data in the directory service). Note that for purposes of explanation herein, the user performing such group policy object-related tasks will be referred to as an administrator, although it is understood that any user with appropriate security privileges can perform these tasks, even if not actually designated as an administrator.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A core unit in the Active Directory® service is a domain, shown via domains D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which are each controlled by one or more domain controllers, shown as the domain controller <b>205</b> and the domain controller <b>206</b>, respectively. Note that there may be more than one domain controller per domain. Many of the objects of a network exist within a domain. As generally represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a single domain can span multiple physical locations or sites (e.g., <b>302</b>), and domains can be grouped together into a forest <b>304</b>, typically in some logical grouping as determined by an administrator. A site <b>302</b> comprises one or more ranges of IP addresses of which computers can be a member, often a grouping of computers related by some geographical area.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Organizational units (e.g., OU<b>1</b>-OU<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are a type of directory object included within domains that are hierarchically organized logical containers into which users, groups, computers, and even other organizational units may be logically placed. Group policy objects e.g., GP<b>1</b>-GP<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are stored in (exist in) a domain, and can be applied to one or more sites, domains, and/or organizational units. Note that a site, domain, and/or organizational unit may be referred to as a scope of management, or SOM. It will be readily appreciated that although described herein with reference to Microsoft Windows®, the Active Directory® service, sites, domains, organizational units, and so forth, the present invention is not limited thereto, nor even to directory containers in general, but rather is applicable to any types of policy objects and/or scoping mechanisms that require management in a network.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To apply policy to policy recipients (users and machines) of the network, group policy objects may be created via a Group Policy Management Console (e.g., <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> or <b>212</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), or similar program with a suitable user and/or programmatic interface. Note that as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an instance of the Group Policy Management Console may be run from essentially any machine in the network that is capable of running a management program, including client machines (e.g., <b>220</b>) or the domain controllers <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>. Once created, group policy objects may then be linked to an appropriate container or containers (e.g., objects representing a scope of management, such as sites, domains and organizational units) that are arranged in a hierarchy with which the policy recipients are associated. For example, any Group Policy Management Console <b>210</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>212</b> or similar user interface tool allows administrators to selectively associate the group policy objects GPO<b>1</b> and GPO<b>2</b> with directory container objects D<b>1</b>, OU<b>1</b> and OU<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Note that as represented by the dashed line from Domain A to the group policy object GPOA<b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a group policy object may exist in a domain but not be linked to a container.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each group policy object (e.g., GPO<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be composed of group policy information maintained in many locations in the network, including objects and attributes stored in the Active Directory® service <b>202</b>, and collections of system volume (sysvol) files, wherein the sysvol comprises a folder on a domain controller (e.g., <b>206</b>), such as used to replicate file-based data among domain controllers. The policy information may include one or more pointers to another location (e.g., a data file on a remote share) where some or all of the actual policy information (or a further pointer thereto) is maintained. Policy information also may be stored in a virtual registry (e.g., a copy of some or all of a client machine's registry maintained in a file on the server, specifically in the group policy template), that may be used by an extension to put information into the client-machine's registry.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Because many group policy objects can apply to one policy recipient, such as via a domain association or one or more organizational units to which the policy recipient belongs, for each policy recipient, the policy settings maintained in the policy objects may be selectively accumulated in an order of precedence, inherited from the group policy objects associated with one or more higher-up organizational units, a site, and/or the domain, and/or blocked from being inherited. In general, to accumulate policy for a policy recipient, policies are applied in a manner such higher policies that are enforced take precedence by hierarchical order, while higher non-enforced policies may be overridden by lower-level policies.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Reporting Hierarchically Arranged Data</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The Group Policy Management Console, in conjunction with a Microsoft® Management Console (MMC), for example, provides a mechanism for representing and managing group policy objects and relationships among various aspects of group policy-related data. Note that the Group Policy Management Console can be configured to operate in other environments, however one reason that the Group Policy Management Console was incorporated into the MMC environment is to be grouped with other MMC tools that may be appropriate to the administrator's overall tasks. The Group Policy Management Console <b>212</b> provides this group policy representation and management functionality in a number of ways, including by providing a user interface and underlying logic for managing group policy. For example, from a single unified view, an administrator can view, manage, and search across domains, sites, and even forests, copy group policy objects and import data to group policy objects, and so forth, as generally described in the aforementioned patent applications, Ser. Nos. 10/410,887; 10/410,883; 10/410,865; and 10/411,876.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As will be understood, however, the present invention is more general, and applies to programs items other than the Group Policy Management Console, in that the present invention may be adapted to represent, in a straightforward, intuitive, and easy to use report format, (wherein reporting refers to viewing, transmitting, persisting, printing and so forth) any content that is capable of being displayed in the MMC or similar programs which use a tree structure on one (e.g., left) pane and a varied, disparate, and rich user interface on another (e.g., right) pane. Thus, although the examples herein will primarily be described with reference to group policy objects and resultant set of policy data, as well as an MMC environment, it is understood that the present invention may be implemented with virtually any hierarchical arrangement of data such as in MMC, in which an HTML and/or XML report is desired. Note that the HTML document may be rendered by any contemporary browser, not just in an MMC environment such as hosting the Group Policy Management Console snap-in.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a prior way in which group policy objects were managed in an MMC environment, namely by a group policy object editor (GPEdit) MMC snap-in program. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a single group policy object was generally displayed as a tree on the left side, and the policy settings located by navigating the tree and expanding and collapsing the nodes to locate a particular setting among the full set of enabled, disabled and not configured settings. In this GPEdit snap-in, a node is selected via expansion and navigation, and the next level of information under that selected node (e.g., sub-nodes or setting data) is shown in the right side. Eventually, the administrator selects a leaf node corresponding to a policy that can have a setting. The policy might or might not be enabled for that group policy object; if enabled, the right side pane displays the setting's data. However, many of the policies in a given group policy object are often not configured, and thus as can be readily appreciated, an administrator has to perform a significant amount of navigation to view the various settings for a group policy object, which is considerably time-consuming and tedious.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is created an HTML document, that when rendered on a rendering engine (e.g., in a browser or the like), provides an interactive expandable and collapsible view of the settings data corresponding to an item in one part (e.g., the left side) of the console, such as a view of the settings data for a group policy object, or a view of a resultant set of policy report. As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in an example MMC environment with a Group Policy Management Console snap-in, multiple group policy objects are displayed in a tree view in a left pane, while the HTML document is rendered and made interactive (navigable) in a right pane.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In keeping with an aspect of the present invention, when a settings tab is selected, (which initially may be selected by default upon selection of a group policy object in the tree), only the configured settings of that selected group policy object are presented in the right pane. This eliminates the need for an administrator to have to navigate over significant numbers of not configured settings (e.g., presently on the order of one-thousand) to view the settings of a group policy object. Note that as used herein, an administrator can be any user having rights to access the group policy object. However, unlike the GPEdit program (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) which required that the user have read-write access to a group policy object, the rights required to view a report for a group policy object also can be read-only, allowing an administrator to delegate some group policy object tasks to a read-only level user, thereby ensuring that a delegated task can be performed without the group policy object being changed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In general, when any group policy object is selected in the left pane, an HTML report document may be created as described below, and rendered such that the user sees a representation of the HTML document in the right pane (with the settings tab active). The administrator then interacts with the right pane by clicking on any of the displayed bars, causing the display to toggle between showing and hiding various levels of a hierarchical structure that corresponds to the group policy object's structure, down to the settings data itself. In other words, the administrator navigates the right pane simply by scrolling as desired and clicking on any bar, expanding and contracting the sublevels (secondary sections) until the desired data for a setting (or settings) is displayed. Although not readily apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the colors have been chosen for good contrast and clear viewing in general.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one implementation, the layout of the document has a structure that closely maps the structure of the left hierarchical pane in the prior Group Policy Object Editor (GPEdit) program (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), so that a user familiar with that program and MMC can easily understand a particular setting and its relationship to other settings when the document is rendered. To this end, as described below, the contents of the right pane in GPEdit, which may vary substantially such as due to many property pages and/or a deep level of multiple dialogs, are mapped into an HTML report in accordance with the present invention that is then displayable, such as by a browser or in the right pane of the group policy management console. As mentioned above, in this implementation only the configured settings are present in the displayed report.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one implementation, there are two forms of the HTML report, including a version for viewing that is shown in the user interface of the group policy management console, such as on the “Settings” tab of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This report maps to the namespace in GPEdit (represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and has two primary sections, namely “User Configuration” and “Computer Configuration” sections, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Another form (version) of the HTML report is available for printing or saving the report to a file. This printing/saving version contains the data of the viewing version (e.g. the GPEdit content), plus additional data about the group policy object that is not displayed, but useful to an administrator in understanding the group policy object. In this implementation, the printing/saving version has three primary sections, the aforementioned “User Configuration” and “Computer Configuration” sections, plus a “General” section. The “General section” provides the contents of what appears in the user interface on the other tabs (that is, not the “Settings” tab), including “Scope,” “Details” and “Delegation” tabs, which are not shown herein to avoid redundancy. For example, this information would identify the location of the group policy object, its ACLs (who can edit it, read it, apply it, and so forth), the version numbers of the group policy object, the GUID, the WMI filter if any and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The computer configuration section shows the computer configuration settings of a group policy object, and is appended with “(Enabled)” or “(Disabled)” to indicate the status for that portion of the group policy object. The user configuration section shows the user configuration settings of a group policy object, and is appended with either “(Enabled)” or “(Disabled)” to indicate the status for that portion of the group policy object. Note that similar concepts appear as nodes in the GPEdit (navigable left-side) namespace (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Within the Computer and user configuration sections, subsections in the report are created, having different colors and different indentations. These subsections map relatively well to the prior GPEdit namespace in the MMC. Essentially, each sub-node (and its primary sub-nodes) in MMC such as Software Settings, Windows Settings, Administrative Templates (the first level) maps to a subheading in the HTML report. Note that there are a few exceptions where headings in Html were either omitted or added, namely there is no separate heading in HTML for the “Software Settings” folder shown in MMC, because that folder always only contains one child, “Software Installation,” and this avoids redundancy. Also, in the HTML, under the Software Settings section, a header has been added for Assigned and Published applications (which are different ways to deploy applications), in order to group applications by deployment type, which is generally useful but not present in GPEdit. Another exception includes that in the “Computer Configuration\Windows\security” section, subheadings were added under the “Local Policies\Security Options” container. This is because in the MMC user interface there are many (approximately sixty-five) settings, and many of those have names that begin with the same pre-pended text for easy grouping, e.g. several settings begin with “Domain Controller” to discuss settings relevant for domain controllers. In the HTML report, the pre-pended text has been converted into subheadings under the Security Options section.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To map from the various types of data that were able to appear in the right pane in the GPEdit snap-in (e.g., approximately forty-five different user interface layouts existed in MMC GPEdit), various types were identified, with a layout designed for each of the types. The layouts were then represented in HTML using six basic table structures. In other words, the different user interface structures of the GPEdit console were identified and mapped to a table layout usable in HTML. By way of example, one such type of settings was grouped into a simple “administrative templates” category, in which such policy settings may be set to either enabled, disabled, or not configured. Other administrative templates may be more complex, with several sub-settings. Script settings are another type, having a two-column table listing the script name and script parameters. Other settings were much richer, for example Folder Redirection of My Documents is a property page, with multiple tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the implementation described herein, the expand/contract user interface for reporting in the right pane was designed to be analogous to the user interface in the left navigation pane of the GPEdit display. This mapping model was constructed by taking the individual container nodes in the tree and creating a corresponding line header in the report. Based upon the hierarchy in the left navigation pane, indentation and visual contrast were used to denote relationships. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents, in a side-by-side view of the prior art display (left) versus the reporting display (right) of the present invention, how the high-level containers (buckets) are organized and related, via the numbers <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> appearing both to the left of the tree containers and to the right of the descriptive text in the bars of the HTML representation. The following table shows the levels:</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When navigating beyond the high level container nodes in the prior art tree, a mix of both container nodes and end (leaf) nodes are encountered. Container nodes (folder icons) can contain both additional containers and settings pages, while end nodes hold only settings pages. Settings pages (having various icons) are accessed by choosing to view “properties” (synonymous with settings) of that page, which will open a dialog containing those properties. These properties are displayed inline in the reporting user interface of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows this relationship. When a container holds both containers and Settings pages, the bottom level header can contain a “/” delineated path as a mechanism for articulating the Settings' relationship to the left navigation area. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, consider the Public Key Policies/Autoenrollment Settings (labeled 5 and 8 in the reporting user interface on the right. Since the container Public Key Policies contains bottom level containers and settings, the respective setting or bucket is displayed representative of its relationship to its uplevel node (labeled 5). However, the Public Key Policies/Encrypting File System (labeled 6 on the right) has a representation that is the same as the property page, but is a container node. This container node, although not a property page itself, is a bottom level container which can hold multiple simple settings inside of it. As a result, the node is treated as a de facto property page that shows multiple simple settings in a table view, where the term “Policy” is the header that describes the individual settings.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A substantial part of the reporting mechanism is directed towards representing the actual settings pages beneath the navigable areas, as generally represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in which the settings area are generally delimited. Thus, in addition to the report mapping to the left navigation tree area in the GPEdit program, the data in the report maps to the content in the settings pages. Note that a property/settings page is essentially a pop-up dialog which hosts some configurable data, typically accessed by double clicking on a property node, or right-click and selecting “Properties.”</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Settings pages vary in levels of depth and complexity, such as from simple single-tabbed dialogs having checkboxes, to deep, multi-tabbed and complex dialogs, such as having dropdowns and/or tabs that switch between multiple instances of settings data, e.g., a listing of multiple users and groups, with separate settings (e.g., in checkboxes) maintained for each. Settings pages are built in a relatively modular manner, in which basic structures are combined, through mechanism like tabs, dropdown menus and drill-down buttons to stitch together basic settings into complex settings pages.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, individual properties pages are translated into their respective containers in the reporting user interface. Note that settings pages in the GPEdit often vary widely, in practice because settings are often authored by different teams with multiple requirements and differing needs, and then combined together in one GPEdit-based user interface. However, properties page are created using Windows® controls, including (but not limited to) radio buttons, check boxes, drop down lists, combo boxes, edit boxes and static labels, which provides an inherent level of minimal consistency in the creation of settings pages. As will become apparent, most settings pages are straightforward to handle, while others require more complex pages, however using basic rules as templates any page can be represented in the report.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Basic Settings comprise relatively simple configurations that take the form of an enable/disable toggle, along with some data setting that needs configuration after an item is enabled. An example of how such a property dialog as traditionally rendered is represented in the report is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when one basic setting in one container is present. Note that by default, the Group Policy Management Console does not show non-configured settings, and thus there is no need in the report to show these, as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in which the setting is simply displayed by the term Success. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows how multiple basic settings in one container are presented.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Items can be nested inside of properties pages through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms may include tabs, drill down buttons, combination boxes, and virtually any other Windows® controls switching mechanism. The present invention displays these changes without losing hierarchy or context. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example of how tab modifying controls are presented in the report. In general, modifying controls are presented by giving the modifying control (the tabs in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) a differently colored (e.g., gray) header underneath a navigation header of another color (e.g., blue) to give context and then place the data in the report as normal.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Another contingency that is handled is when nested data is present in the same dialog, e.g., additional setting data is nested inside of a tab structure, either via multiple properties or via drilldown buttons. The prior art dialog shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> represent one such example, in which the “Advanced” button of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is clicked resulting in either the left pop-up dialog or the right pop-up dialog of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> being presented, depending on the tab, and having multiple tabs and settings.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows how such nested data in the same dialog is presented in a report (note that the data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> do not correspond to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, however it is seen how multiple layers of settings are displayed in a report). To this end, the leftmost (e.g., blue) bar is the navigational header, and the shaded (e.g., gray) headers underneath the navigational header are the tab names, with the policy is represented underneath each secondary header. Under Network Security, the white (unshaded) boxes provide the grouping mechanism to denote hierarchy in drilldown or multiple properties scenarios in a dialog. The white box contains the properties from the drilldown or multiple properties list.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this manner, the design is built in a modular manner. As long as precedent is followed, the design model can be implemented as deeply into a tree structure as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As can be readily appreciated, the Group Policy Management Console reporting mechanism is capable of representing virtually any hierarchical structure having data at leaf nodes, as in the example above wherein the reporting mechanism represents the policy settings configured in a group policy object. Thus, the reporting mechanism can also represent the resultant set of policy (RSoP) settings, in a logging or planning mode WMI namespace, in an HTML document. The HTML document can be viewed from the Group Policy Management Console, or any other suitable HTML rendering component.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of an architecture <b>1500</b> configured to collect group policy object settings and output markup language documents based on those settings, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. In one embodiment, the overall architecture is built on a foundation of .net objects and XML schemas (described below), and is implemented in managed C# code that leverages the .net framework's class libraries and rich XML support. The XML schemas form the foundation, with the setting possibilities for each policy extension described in an XML schema. Around those schemas, an XML schema <b>1502</b> for the group policy object and a schema for the RSoP containment objects (described below) are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, the settings for a group policy object <b>1504</b> are a combination of directory service settings <b>1506</b> and sysvol settings <b>1508</b>. A GPO read and translate mechanism <b>1510</b> in a reporting mechanism <b>1512</b> collects these settings group policy object data <b>1514</b> that are then processed. To this end, the read and translate mechanism <b>1512</b> queries the domain controller and reads the sysvol and Active Directory® for the appropriate settings. The settings in a group policy object are generally stored in one of three possible formats, including DS objects and attributes, .ini style files, and a custom registry.pol binary file for storing ADM settings. Some extensions (e.g. Internet Explorer Maintenance) also store their settings in binary files. These settings are consumed through classes of the .net class library System.DirectoryServices namespace, a shared custom implementation of an .ini file parser, and registry.pol file and ADM file parsers.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">To read and translate, a .net object type, in the form of a C# class, is derived from each of the high level schemas. In additional to some type similarities associated with their underlying schemas, the C# policy extension classes implement a common set of inherited methods. One method is an initialization from a group policy object, given the group policy object's directory service and sysvol paths, and corresponds to the GPO read and translate mechanism <b>1510</b>. Note that another method performs an initialization from an RSoP namespace, as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Another set of classes persists the class into an HTML representation <b>1516</b>, as generally described above, comprising code which conceptually writes out large sections of static HTML text interspersed with data inserted from the fields of the class. This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by the HTML translator <b>1518</b>. Note that the HTML translator can use a localized string table <b>1520</b> to render the GPO's HTML representation <b>1516</b> output in an appropriate language. The HTML translation specification <b>1521</b> essentially represents the mapping mechanism (the method of converting hierarchical data to HTML) described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition to presenting the information to a user via HTML, the present invention is also able to persist the information to an XML document/representation <b>1522</b>. Note that no method needs to be implemented for persisting the classes into XML, as this functionality is provided via an XML serializer class <b>1524</b> already available in the .NET framework class libraries. Any .net managed class can be serialized to XML. In the .net framework, class serialization to XML comprises a conversion of each public field in a class to an XML element. To leverage this, the designs of the .net class objects include public class fields for each of the elements to write in the XML instance documents. Note that the framework software development kit includes a tool, xsd.exe, which takes an XML schema as input and outputs C# classes and enumeration which represent the complexTypes and simpleTypes in the schema. Once constructor or initialization methods are written for these classes, there is no further work needed to serialize the classes to XML, as the integrated xml support allows us to completely avoid any of the DOM based xml programming that would have otherwise been needed to construct these instance documents.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the reporting mechanism <b>1512</b> and its functionality thus may be implemented in a single .net assembly, and can be invoked directly from other managed code. The assembly may be registered for COM interoperability. The .net assembly enables the mechanism <b>1510</b> to be invoked from the implementation of the IGPMRSoP and IGPMGPO interfaces of the Group Policy Management Console API set, (described in the aforementioned patent application Ser. No. 10/411,876). Consumers of the Group Policy Management Console interfaces (such as scripts and the internal Group Policy Management Console user interface may remain contained within an existing COM-based interface design.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The API model for invoking the reporting functionality remains part of the overall GPMC COM base interfaces. Both the IGPMRSoP and IGMGPO interfaces implement GenerateReport methods which can be used for generated the xml and/or html documents from either an RSoP namespace or a single group policy object. Another interface, IGPMBackup, also implements the GenerateReport method to generate reports for backed up group policy objects, that is, the HTML report may be generated from an XML report persisted with a group policy object backup. Internally these methods invoke the reporting mechanism (the .net assembly) via unmanaged to managed COM interop interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Note that the .net objects exposed by the assembly can be invoked outside the scope of the GPMC COM interfaces. Only the GPO and RSoP classes of the assembly are registered for unmanaged COM interop.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, there is shown a similar representation by which RSoP settings <b>1607</b> are consumed, by initializing the various .net class objects from a WMI namespace <b>1604</b> using classes from the .net class library System.Management namespace.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The RSoP data is slightly different from the GPO data. For example, the group policy object report contains some general information about the group policy object, including its identifier, the last time it was modified, and so forth which is not applicable in the RSoP case. Instead, RSoP reports have their own general information, such as the user or computer for which the data was logged or simulated, the set of GPOs that apply to the target, the set of security groups to which the target belongs, and so forth. This general data is specific to RSoP reports.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The settings data are very similar for both group policy object and RSoP reports. One distinction is that the RSoP report will give the “winning group policy object” for a particular setting, that is, the group policy object from which that setting came and which overrode other group policy objects. In addition, there are some (relatively rare) cases where the RSoP data for a setting contains more information than the group policy object data for the same setting. This is true of scripts settings, where in the group policy object case, there is only have the script name and parameters, but in the RSoP logging case, there is the name and parameters, as well as the time the script was last executed on the target.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The overall flow of data through the architectures <b>1500</b> and <b>1600</b> is relatively straightforward and direct, as for GPOs, the GPO read and translate mechanism <b>1510</b> (the .net class objects) read the group policy object settings <b>1514</b> directly from the DS and sysvol components of the group policy object. For RSoP settings, the RSoP read and translate mechanism <b>1610</b> (another method of the .net class objects) reads the RSoP settings <b>1607</b> from a WMI namespace <b>1604</b>. Once the classes have been initialized, an XML document which conforms to the corresponding GPO schema <b>1502</b> or RSoP schema <b>1602</b>, as appropriate, may be produced by utilizing the XmlSerializer class (<b>1524</b> or <b>1624</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, respectively) of the .net class library. For generating HTML documents, the group policy object and RSoP root elements, as well as each extension, implement an appropriate method for persisting their settings into the statically defined HTML format, as generally represented by the HTML translator <b>1518</b> and the HTML translator <b>1618</b>, described above.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In general, the schema design provides an implementation and testing framework and blueprint, while also enabling some level of enforcement of valid XML documents. Generated XML documents need to be valid against these defined schemas, providing a first level of internal verification</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Group policy objects and RSoPs are two possible root element types in generated XML documents. A document produced from a group policy object begins with the &lt;gpo&gt; root element and a document produced from an RSoP namespace begins with the &lt;RSoP&gt; root element.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The ExtensionsSettings type is an abstract type which simply contains a Name element and which policy extension schemas derive from.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Policy extension types derive from the abstract GPOExtension type. Each policy extension type comprises elements of types inherited from another abstract type SettingBase_at, and represents a unit that can be individually configured in a group policy object. The policy extension types as well as their detailed settings types define the elements which are used in both group policy object and RSoP XML documents. The instances of these elements in these two situations are common enough that optional elements are used where needed for RSoP attributes, rather than defining separate derived types.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The base abstract setting type SettingBase_at contains an optional group policy object and an optional Precedence element. These two elements are utilized when the setting type is utilized to instantiate RSoP settings. Thus for the purpose of just representing settings within a single group policy object, the SettingBase_at is irrelevant, however it does serve to form a base of commonality for how extension schemas are formulated.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Thus each extension schema is factored as a new complexType derived from GPOExtension. Each top level element of this type is then of a type which derives from SettingBase_at. To illustrate this, a simple schema for the scripts extension top level type and setting type is included below:</p>
