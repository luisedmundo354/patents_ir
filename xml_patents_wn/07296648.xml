<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a power control apparatus for a four-wheel drive hybrid vehicle having an internal combustion engine and a motor as power sources.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle is known in the art, which, for example, includes an internal combustion engine as a power source for driving front wheels, an AC generator that is driven by the internal combustion engine, an electrical energy storage device for storing electrical energy generated by the AC generator, and a motor that drives rear wheels by being supplied with electrical energy from the electrical energy storage device, and in which the amount of generation by the AC generator is controlled depending on the difference between the rotational speeds of the front wheels and the rear wheels (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 11-318001).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, conventionally, a hybrid vehicle is known in the art, which, for example, includes an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels, a generator that is driven by the internal combustion engine, and a motor that drives the other of the front and rear wheels by being supplied with electrical energy from the generator, and in which a target torque of the motor is determined depending on the difference between the rotational speeds of the front wheels and the rear wheels, or depending on a depression amount of the accelerator pedal (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-177909).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above-mentioned power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle, because the motor for the rear wheels is driven by merely being supplied with electrical energy from the electrical energy storage device, the capacity of the electrical energy storage device must be increased, or the output voltage of the electrical energy storage device must be made higher in order to increase the output power of the motor. In such a case, problems are encountered in that the electrical energy storage device becomes large, and high tension elements become large.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, in the above-mentioned hybrid vehicle, because the motor for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels is driven by merely being supplied with electrical energy from the generator, the output power of the motor is limited by the maximum electrical power of the generator; therefore, a desired output power may not be obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was conceived in view of the above circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle, which includes an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels, a motor that drives the other of the front and rear wheels, and an electrical energy storage device that receives energy from and sends energy to the motor, and which enables obtaining a desired output power of the motor without increasing the size of the electrical energy storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle including: an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels; a first motor-generator which is connected to an output shaft of the internal combustion engine; a second motor-generator which is connected to the other of the front and rear wheels; an electrical energy storage device which receives energy from and sends energy to the first and second motor-generators; and a control unit which is operatively connected to the internal combustion engine, the first and second motor-generator, and the electrical energy storage device, and which includes: an electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device; an electrical power calculation section for calculating the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or for calculating the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator; an output power command calculation section for calculating an output power command for a powering operation of the second motor-generator; and an output power limiting section which is adapted to calculate the sum of the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or the difference between the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator, to compare magnitudes of the sum or the difference and of the output power command for the second motor-generator, and to set the smaller of the sum or the difference and the output power command for the second motor-generator as a new output power command for the second motor-generator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, the second motor-generator can be operated using the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator in addition to the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device. As a result, the front wheels or the rear wheels can be driven by the second motor-generator with an output power which is greater than the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device by the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator. In other words, the output power of the second motor-generator can be greater, without increasing the size of the electrical energy storage device, than in the case in which the second motor-generator is operated merely using the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device or the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, the electrical power which can be supplied from the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator to the second motor-generator, i.e., the sum of the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or the difference between the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator, is calculated, and when the sum or the difference is smaller than the output power command for the second motor-generator, the output power command for the second motor-generator is limited by the output power limiting section. As a result, the second motor-generator can be operated in a powering manner while the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator are preferably operated in such a manner that, for example, the electrical energy storage device is prevented from being over-discharged, and the first motor-generator is prevented from receiving an excessive electrical generation command.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a second electrical energy storage device which is different from the electrical energy storage device, and which is operatively connected to the control unit. The control unit may further include a second electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device, and the electrical discharge amount calculation section may be adapted to set a calculated value, which is obtained by subtracting the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device from the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device, as a new electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, at least the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device can be supplemented by the electrical energy storage device, and at the same time, the output power of the second motor-generator can be increased while the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator are preferably operated.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a second electrical energy storage device which is different from the electrical energy storage device, and which is operatively connected to the control unit. The control unit may further include a second electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device, and a generation command calculation section which is adapted to obtain a calculated value by subtracting the output power command for the second motor-generator and the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device from the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device, and to set the absolute value of the calculated value as a generation command for a generating operation of the first motor-generator when the calculated value is negative.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, when the sum of the output power command for the second motor-generator and the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device is greater than the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device, the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator may be increased so that the output power of the second motor-generator and the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device can be provided by the electrical power dischargeable from the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a deterioration detecting device for determining whether the electrical energy storage device has deteriorated, and the control unit may further include an output power command setting section for setting the output power command for the second motor-generator in such a manner that, when the electrical power calculation section is calculating the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator, and when deterioration of the electrical energy storage device is detected by the deterioration detecting device, the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator which is calculated by the electrical power calculation section is set as the output power command for the second motor-generator.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, when deterioration of the electrical energy storage device is detected, the output power command for the second motor-generator can be ensured by the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle may further include a second electrical energy storage device which is different from the electrical energy storage device, and which is operatively connected to the control unit. The control unit may further include a second electrical discharge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device, and the output power command setting section may be adapted to set a calculated value, which is obtained by subtracting the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device from the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator which is calculated by the electrical power calculation section, as the output power command for the second motor-generator.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle configured as described above, when deterioration of the electrical energy storage device is detected, the electrical power being discharged from the second electrical energy storage device in addition to the output power command for the second motor-generator can be ensured by the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention further provides a power control apparatus for a hybrid vehicle including: an internal combustion engine for driving either the front wheels or the rear wheels; a first motor-generator which is connected to an output shaft of the internal combustion engine; a second motor-generator which is connected to the other of the front and rear wheels; an electrical energy storage device which receives energy from and sends energy to the first and second motor-generators; and a control unit which is operatively connected to the internal combustion engine, the first and second motor-generator, and the electrical energy storage device, and which includes: an electrical charge amount calculation section for calculating the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device; an electrical power calculation section for calculating the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator or for calculating the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator; a regeneration command calculation section for calculating a regeneration command for a regenerating operation of the second motor-generator; and a regeneration limiting section which is adapted to calculate the sum of the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator or the difference between the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device and the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator, to compare magnitudes of the sum or the difference and of the regeneration command for the second motor-generator, and to set the smaller of the sum or the difference and the regeneration command for the second motor-generator as a new regeneration command for the second motor-generator.</p>

As a result, an amount of electrical energy, by which the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy exceeds the electrical power being generated by the first motor-generator, can be provided by the regenerating operation of the second motor-generator. In other words, the regenerated energy from the second motor-generator can be greater, without increasing the size of the electrical energy storage device, than in the case in which the second motor-generator is operated in a regeneration manner merely depending on the electrical power chargeable into the electrical energy storage device or depending on the electrical power being supplied to the first motor-generator.</p>

As a result, the second motor-generator can be operated in a regenerating manner while the electrical energy storage device and the first motor-generator are preferably operated in such a manner that, for example, the electrical energy storage device is prevented from being over-charged, and the first motor-generator is prevented from being supplied with an excessive electrical power.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment of the power control device for a hybrid vehicle according to the present invention will be explained below with reference to the appended drawings. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the power control device <b>10</b> for a hybrid vehicle according to this embodiment is installed in a four-wheel drive hybrid vehicle <b>1</b> in which, for example, an internal combustion engine (indicated by ENG in the drawings) <b>11</b>, a front motor-generator (M/G<b>1</b>) <b>12</b>, and a transmission (T/M) <b>13</b>, which are directly connected to each other in series, are connected to front wheels Wf via a front differential gear box DF, and a rear motor-generator (M/G<b>2</b>) <b>14</b> is connected to rear wheels Wr via a rear differential gear box DR. The power control device <b>10</b> includes a main battery (BATT) <b>15</b>, a front power drive unit (PDU<b>1</b>) <b>16</b>, a rear power drive unit (PDU<b>2</b>) <b>17</b>, a DC-DC converter (DC-DC) <b>18</b>, an auxiliary battery <b>19</b>, a battery ECU <b>21</b>, a motor ECU <b>22</b>, an engine and T/M ECU <b>23</b>, and a management ECU <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the hybrid vehicle <b>1</b>, the driving powers of the internal combustion engine <b>11</b> and the front motor-generator <b>12</b> are transmitted to the front wheels Wf via the transmission <b>13</b> such as an automatic transmission (A/T), a CVT, a manual transmission (M/T), or the like, and via the front differential gear box DF which distributes the driving power between the right and left front wheels Wf.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The driving power of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> is transmitted to the rear wheels Wr via the rear differential gear box DR which has a clutch (not shown), and which distributes the driving power between the right and left rear wheels Wr.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the clutch (not shown) provided in the rear differential gear box DR is disengaged, the vehicle is placed in a front-wheel drive state in which solely the front wheels Wf are driven, and when the clutch is engaged, the vehicle is placed in a four-wheel drive state in which both the front and rear wheels Wf and Wr are driven. In the four-wheel drive state, distribution of the driving power between the right and left rear wheels Wr can be freely controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Moreover, when power is transmitted in reverse from the front wheels Wf to the front motor-generator <b>12</b>, and from the rear wheels Wr to the rear motor-generator <b>14</b>, such as when the hybrid vehicle <b>1</b> decelerates, the motor-generators <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> act as generators so as to generate so-called regenerative braking force, whereby the kinetic energy of the vehicle is recovered as electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The powering operation and regenerating operation (generating operation) of the motor-generators <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are controlled by the power drive units <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> while receiving control commands from the motor ECU <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To the power drive units <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, each of which includes a PWM inverter that operates in a pulse width modulation mode, the high voltage main battery <b>15</b>, which receives energy from and sends energy to the motor-generators <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, is connected. The main battery <b>15</b> includes a plurality of modules which are connected to each other in series, and each of which, as a unit, includes a plurality of cells which are connected to each other in series. Furthermore, the 12-volt auxiliary battery <b>19</b>, which is provided for operating various electrical accessories, is connected to the main battery <b>15</b> via the DC-DC converter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The DC-DC converter <b>18</b>, which is controlled by the management ECU <b>24</b>, steps down voltage between terminals of the main battery <b>15</b>, or steps down voltage generated by the motor-generators <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> while being controlled by the power drive units <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> in order to charge the auxiliary battery <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The power drive units <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, and the DC-DC converter <b>18</b> are connected to the main battery <b>15</b> in parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The battery ECU <b>21</b> protects the main battery <b>15</b>, calculates a state of charge SOC of the battery, and calculates the electrical power dischargeable from the main battery <b>15</b> and the electrical power charged into the main battery <b>15</b>. Moreover, the battery ECU <b>21</b> determines whether or not the main battery <b>15</b> deteriorates depending on the state of charge SOC, a measured voltage between the terminals of the main battery <b>15</b>, the temperature of the main battery <b>15</b>, past changes in discharged current and charged current, etc. To this end, the battery ECU <b>21</b> is provided with signals from a current sensor <b>25</b> for measuring current flowing into and from the main battery <b>15</b>, and signals from a voltage sensor (not shown) for measuring voltage between the terminals of the main battery <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The motor ECU <b>22</b> controls the powering operation and regenerating operation of the motor-generators <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in accordance with a powering torque command and a regenerating torque command which are input from the management ECU <b>24</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The management ECU <b>24</b> controls the operations of the battery ECU <b>21</b>, of the motor ECU <b>22</b>, of the engine and T/M ECU <b>23</b>, and of the DC-DC converter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As will be explained later, the management ECU <b>24</b> calculates a rear output power limit R_LimPow, which is an output power limit applied to the powering operation of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b>, and sets an output power command (i.e., a rear drive command R_PowCmd) for the powering operation of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> based on, for example, a battery output power limit B_LimPow, which is the electrical power dischargeable from the main battery <b>15</b>, a front output power F_POWER, which is an output power from the front motor-generator <b>12</b>, and an accessory output power DV_POWER, and the management ECU <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To this end, the management ECU <b>24</b> is provided with signals from current sensors <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> for respectively measuring current flowing into and from the power drive units <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the battery temperature output limit (Plim_Tbat) table, the battery temperature output limit Plim_Tbat is, for example, set so as to be a predetermined upper limit when the temperature TBAT of the battery is within a predetermined range, so as to increase to the predetermined upper limit in accordance with increase in the temperature TBAT of the battery when the temperature TBAT of the battery is lower than the predetermined range, and so as to decrease from the predetermined upper limit in accordance with increase in the temperature TBAT of the battery when the temperature TBAT of the battery is higher than the predetermined range.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, in step S<b>23</b>, a battery voltage output limit Plim_Vbat is set by referring to a battery voltage output limit (Plim_Vbat) table, which defines output limit depending on the voltage VBAT between terminals of the main battery <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the battery voltage output limit (Plim_Vbat) table, the battery voltage output limit Plim_Vbat is, for example, set so as to be a predetermined upper limit when the voltage VBAT of the battery is within a predetermined range, so as to increase to the predetermined upper limit in accordance with increase in the voltage VBAT of the battery when the voltage VBAT of the battery is below the predetermined range, and so as to decrease from the predetermined upper limit in accordance with increase in the voltage VBAT of the battery when the voltage VBAT of the battery is above the predetermined range.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to the present embodiment of the power control device <b>10</b> for a hybrid vehicle, the output power of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> can be sufficiently increased without increasing the size of the main battery <b>15</b> while preferably operating the main battery <b>15</b> and the front motor-generator <b>14</b>, and while at the same time, the front output power F_POWER and the accessory output power DV_POWER are ensured by the battery output power limit B_LimPow.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the above embodiment, the rear output power limit R_LimPow is calculated based on the front output power F_POWER; however, the present invention is not limited to this, and, for example, the rear output power limit R_LimPow may be calculated based on an amount of generation in the front F_GEN, which is an amount of generation by the regenerative operation of the front motor-generator <b>12</b>, and which is calculated based on the output current from the front power drive unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In this case, in step S<b>13</b> in the above embodiment, a calculated value, which is obtained by subtracting the accessory output power DV_POWER from a value obtained by adding the amount of generation in the front F_GEN to the battery output power limit B_Lim_Pow, may be set as the rear output power limit R_LimPow.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As a result, the output power of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> can be sufficiently increased without increasing the size of the main battery <b>15</b> while preferably operating the main battery <b>15</b> and the front motor-generator <b>14</b> in contrast to the case in which the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> is operated merely depending on the battery output power limit B_Lim_Pow, or merely depending on the amount of generation in the front F_GEN of the front motor-generator <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition to the above description about the operation for setting the rear drive command R_PowCmd with regard to the above embodiment, the operation for setting a regeneration command which is applied to the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> will be explained below. In this case, instead of the battery output power limit B_LimPow, a battery input power limit B_LimPin, which is the electrical power chargeable into the main battery <b>15</b>, may be calculated based on, for example, the SOC of the battery, the temperature of the battery TBAT, and the voltage VBAT between terminals of the main battery <b>15</b> (step T<b>01</b>). Moreover, instead of the front output power F_POWER in the above embodiment, for example, the amount of generation in the front F_GEN, which is the amount of generation by the regenerative operation of the front motor-generator <b>12</b>, may be calculated based on the output current from the front power drive unit <b>16</b> (step T<b>02</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A calculated value, which is obtained by adding the accessory output power DV_POWER to a value obtained by subtracting the amount of generation in the front F_GEN from the battery input power limit B_LimPin, may be set as a regeneration limit which is applied to the regenerating operation of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> (step T<b>03</b>), and the smaller of a regeneration command applied to the regenerating operation of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> (which is set depending on, for example, the running state of the vehicle, etc. (step T<b>04</b>)) and the regeneration limit may be set as a regeneration limit applied to the regenerating operation of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> (step T<b>05</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the generation command to be applied to the regenerating operation of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b> is set, and when the regeneration limit is set based on the front output power F_POWER instead of the amount of generation in the front F_GEN, a calculated value, which is obtained by adding the accessory output power DV_POWER to a value obtained by adding the front output power F_POWER to the battery input power limit B_LimPin, may be set as the regeneration limit which is applied to the regenerating operation of the rear motor-generator <b>14</b>.</p>
