<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Pressure control in an isolated lower wellbore annulus, defined by a conduit sealably positioned within an isolated lower wellbore segment, is achieved while gravel packing by sensing the pressure within the isolated lower annulus while gravel packing and admitting fluid from the isolated lower annulus into the conduit at one or more discrete locations along the conduit when the sensed pressure corresponds to one or more threshold pressure conditions. The annulus pressure is sensed while gravel packing using a pressure-sensitive device disposed in the annulus, e.g., positioned by the conduit at a high-pressure location. The pressure-sensitive device actuates one or more valves carried along the conduit to admit fluid from the annulus into the conduit at one or more of the discrete locations, and thereby control the pressure in the isolated lower annulus.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to downhole tools used in subsurface well completion pumping operations, and particularly to tools used to enhance the effectiveness of gravel pack operations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. The Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Gravel packing is a method commonly used to complete a well in which the producing formations are loosely or poorly consolidated. In such formations, small particulates referred to as “fines” (e.g., formation sand) may be produced along with the desired formation fluids. This leads to several problems such as clogging the production flowpath, erosion of the wellbore, and damage to expensive completion equipment. Production of fines can be reduced substantially using a steel wellbore screen in conjunction with particles sized to prevent passage of fines such as sand through the screen. Such particles, referred to as “gravel,” are pumped as gravel slurry into an annular region between the wellbore and the screen. The gravel, if properly packed, forms a barrier to prevent the fines from entering the screen, but allows the formation fluid to pass freely therethrough and be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A common problem with gravel packing is the presence of voids in the gravel pack. Voids are often created when the carrier fluid used to convey the gravel is lost or “leaks off” too quickly. The carrier fluid may be lost either by passing into the formation or by passing through the screen where it is collected by the end portion of a service tool used in gravel pack applications, commonly known as a wash pipe, and returned to surface. It is expected and necessary for dehydration to occur at some desired rate to allow the gravel to be deposited in the desired location. However, when the gravel slurry dehydrates too quickly, the gravel can settle out and form a “bridge” whereby it blocks the flow of slurry beyond that point, even though there may be void areas beneath or beyond it. This can defeat the purpose of the gravel pack since the absence of gravel in the voids allows fines to be produced through those voids.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another problem common to gravel packing horizontal wells is the sudden rise in pressure within the wellbore when the initial wave of gravel, the “alpha wave,” reaches the far end or “toe” of the wellbore. The return or “beta wave” carries gravel back up the wellbore, filling the upper portion left unfilled by the alpha wave. As the beta wave progresses up the wellbore, the pressure in the wellbore increases because of frictional resistance to the flow of the carrier fluid. The carrier fluid not lost to the formation conventionally must flow to the toe region because the wash pipe terminates in that region. When the slurry reaches the upper end of the beta wave, the carrier fluid must travel the distance to the toe region in the small annular space between the screen and the wash pipe. As this distance increases, the friction pressure increases, causing the wellbore pressure to increase.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The increased pressure can cause early termination of the gravel pack operation because of the risk that the wellbore pressure can rise above the formation fracture pressure, causing damage to the formation and leading to a bridge at the fracture. Thus, gravel pack operations are typically terminated when the wellbore pressure approaches the formation fracture pressure. Such early termination can lead to an incomplete packing of the wellbore and leave undesirable voids in the gravel pack. The only viable alternative is to redesign the gravel pack, and bear the attendant increases in time and expense, when the annulus pressure is expected to approach the formation fracture pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, a need exists to control the pressure in the wellbore resulting from progression of the carrier fluid beta wave. More particularly, a need exists for maintaining the annulus pressure below the formation's intrinsic fracture pressure on a real-time basis. Additionally, such pressure control should be compatible with subsequent fluid pumping/flow operations that typically following gravel packing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for controlling the pressure in an isolated lower wellbore annulus while gravel packing. The isolated lower annulus is defined by a conduit sealably positioned within an isolated lower wellbore segment. The inventive apparatus includes a plurality of valves carried by the conduit at discrete locations for selectively admitting fluid from the isolated lower annulus into the conduit at the discrete locations. The apparatus further includes a pressure-sensitive device carried by the conduit independently of the valves for sensing the pressure within the isolated lower annulus while gravel packing, and for actuating one of more of the valves when the sensed pressure corresponds to one or more threshold pressure conditions so as to admit fluid from the isolated lower annulus into the conduit and thereby control the pressure within the isolated lower annulus while gravel packing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular embodiments of the inventive apparatus, the conduit includes a wash pipe sealably positioned within a wellbore packer assembly having a tubular wellbore screen depending therefrom. The wash pipe is positioned within the screen such that the screen divides the lower wellbore annulus into an inner lower annulus and an outer lower annulus. The wash pipe may include a crossover portion for delivering fluid to the outer lower annulus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular embodiments of the inventive apparatus, each of the valves includes a valve body carried within the conduit. The valve body is equipped with a first port for admitting fluid from the isolated lower annulus to the conduit. A piston is slidably disposed in a chamber of the valve body and is movable from a position closing the first port to a position opening the first port upon actuation of the piston by the pressure-sensitive device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular embodiments of the inventive apparatus, the piston has a flanged portion disposed for slidable movement within an enlarged portion of the valve body chamber. The flanged piston portion divides the enlarged chamber portion into first and second enlarged chambers. The valve body of such embodiments is equipped with a second port for admitting fluid pressure from the isolated lower wellbore annulus to the first enlarged valve chamber, urging the piston to the position opening the first port. Each of the valves further includes a flow control device moveable between positions opening and closing the second port upon actuation of the flow control device by the pressure-sensitive device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each of the valves according to the inventive apparatus may further include a check valve carried in the first port thereof to ensure fluid flows through the first port in one direction: from the isolated lower annulus to the conduit. The check valve may include a flapper valve having one or more pivotally mounted plates.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular embodiments of the inventive apparatus, the second enlarged chamber of the valve body includes a burn chamber housing a propellant and an igniter system for generating pressure for urging the piston to the position closing the first port.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In particular embodiments of the inventive apparatus, the pressure-sensitive device is carried by the wash pipe such that the pressure-sensitive device is positioned adjacent the wellbore packer assembly, e.g., under the first section of the screen. The pressure-sensitive device may include a pressure transducer and a controller. In such embodiments, the pressure-sensitive device actuates one or more valves by transmitting one or more actuation signals output from the controller. The one or more actuation signals may be transmitted wirelessly or by a conductor (e.g., using electricity or light as a medium) extending between the controller and the valves. The conductor may include one or more insulated wires carried along the wash pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect, the present invention provides a valve for use in a conduit disposed in a wellbore while gravel packing an isolated lower annulus of the wellbore. The inventive valve includes a valve body adapted for carriage within the conduit. The valve body has a first port for admitting fluid from the isolated lower annulus into the conduit, a second port for admitting fluid pressure from the isolated lower annulus into the valve body, and a chamber. A piston is slidably disposed in the valve body chamber and movable between positions closing and opening the first port. The second port admits fluid pressure from the isolated lower annulus to the valve body chamber to urge the piston to the position opening the first port. The inventive valve further includes a closure mechanism for closing the first port. Particular embodiments of the inventive valve further include a flow control device selectively moveable between positions opening and closing the second port.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The valve closure mechanism may include a check valve carried in the first port to close the first port against fluid flow from the conduit to the isolated lower annulus. The check valve may include a flapper valve having one or more pivotally mounted plates.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular embodiments of the inventive valve, the piston has a flanged portion disposed for slidable movement within an enlarged portion of the valve body chamber. The flanged piston portion divides the enlarged chamber portion into first and second enlarged chambers. The second port admits fluid pressure from the isolated lower annulus to the first enlarged chamber to urge the piston to the position opening the first port. In such embodiments, the closure mechanism may include a propellant and an igniter system carried in the second enlarged chamber for generating pressure for urging the piston to the position closing the first port.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for controlling the pressure in an isolated lower wellbore annulus while gravel packing. The isolated lower annulus is defined by a conduit sealably positioned within an isolated lower wellbore segment. The inventive method includes the steps of sensing the pressure within the isolated lower annulus while gravel packing, and admitting fluid from the isolated lower annulus into the conduit at one or more discrete locations along the conduit when the sensed pressure corresponds to one or more threshold pressure conditions, thereby controlling the pressure within the isolated lower annulus while gravel packing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The pressure-sensing step of the inventive method may include sensing the pressure of the isolated lower annulus at a high-pressure location therein. In particular embodiments, the conduit is equipped with a plurality of discretely-located valves therealong, and the high-pressure location is independent of the valve locations.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for reducing the risk of fracturing an isolated lower wellbore segment during beta wave progression while gravel packing using a wash pipe sealably positioned within the isolated lower wellbore segment. The inventive method includes the steps of sensing the pressure within the isolated lower wellbore segment while gravel packing, and admitting fluid from the isolated lower wellbore segment into the wash pipe at one or more discrete locations along the wash pipe when the sensed pressure corresponds to one or more threshold pressure conditions. The threshold pressure condition(s) are based upon the anticipated fracture pressure of the isolated lower wellbore segment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wellbore <b>10</b> is shown having a vertically-deviated upper segment <b>12</b> and a substantially horizontal lower segment <b>14</b>. A casing string <b>16</b> lines the upper segment <b>12</b> while the lower segment <b>14</b> is shown as an open hole, although casing <b>16</b> could be placed in the lower segment <b>14</b> as well. To the extent casing <b>16</b> covers any producing formations, casing <b>16</b> must be perforated to provide fluid communication between the formations and wellbore <b>10</b>, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A packer assembly (hereafter “packer”) <b>18</b> is set generally near the lower end of upper wellbore segment <b>12</b> using the upper conduit portion <b>21</b> of a service tool S, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The packer <b>18</b> engages and seals against the casing <b>16</b>, as is also well known in the art. The packer <b>18</b> has an extension <b>20</b> to which other lower completion equipment such as tubular wellbore screen <b>22</b> can attach. The screen <b>22</b> is preferably disposed adjacent a producing formation F.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The service tool upper portion <b>21</b> is initially dynamically sealed inside an upper polished bore receptacle (PBR) of the packer <b>18</b> and a lower PBR of the packer casing extension <b>20</b>. Accordingly, an upper wellbore annulus <b>26</b> is formed above the packer <b>18</b> between the wall of wellbore <b>10</b> and the wall of the service tool upper portion <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The service tool S has a lower conduit portion commonly known as a wash pipe <b>24</b>. An isolated lower wellbore annulus <b>23</b> is formed between the wall of wellbore <b>10</b> and the wall of the wash pipe <b>24</b>. The screen <b>22</b> divides the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b> into inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a </i>and an outer lower annulus <b>27</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once the packer <b>18</b> is properly set by the service tool S, the service tool is set or “switched” for gravel packing, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Accordingly, a crossover <b>28</b> is positioned below the point where the service tool S passes through the packer <b>18</b>, as is also well known in the art. The crossover <b>28</b> allows fluids pumped through the service tool upper portion <b>21</b> to emerge into the outer lower annulus <b>27</b><i>b </i>below the packer <b>18</b>. On the lower portion of the service tool, fluids entering the wash pipe <b>24</b> below the packer <b>18</b>, such as through the open end <b>25</b> of the wash pipe <b>24</b> at or near the toe T of the wellbore <b>10</b>, are conveyed upwardly through the wash pipe toward a heel H of wellbore <b>10</b>. Upon reaching the crossover <b>28</b>, the returning fluids are conveyed through or past the packer <b>18</b> and into the upper annulus <b>26</b>, through which the return fluids are ultimately conveyed to the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At least one valve member, such as a diverter valve <b>30</b>, is mounted to the wash pipe <b>24</b> below the packer <b>18</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, three diverter valves <b>30</b> are carried at discrete points A, B, C for selectively admitting fluid from the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b> into the wash pipe <b>24</b> at the discrete locations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a simplified schematic representation of the array <b>29</b> of diverter valves <b>30</b> as positioned by the wash pipe <b>24</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) independently of, but in wired communication with, the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> (described below). Each diverter valve <b>30</b> preferably forms an integral part of the wall of the wash pipe <b>24</b>, but other embodiments such as valve members being mounted to the wash pipe <b>24</b> such that the valve covers and seals openings (not shown) in the wash pipe are within the scope of this invention. The valves <b>30</b> may be (or may comprise) check valves, meaning they will allow fluid to flow in one direction only when in an open state, as is described further below with respect to FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows schematically the components of one embodiment of a diverter valve <b>30</b>. Each of the valves <b>30</b> includes a valve body carried within and/or forming part of the wash pipe <b>24</b>. The valve body includes an upper housing <b>32</b> attached to a lower housing <b>34</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the valve housings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> attached by a threaded connection, other connectors or connection-types may be used. Additionally, the valves <b>30</b> may also employ a single-piece body, rather than the two-piece body shown.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The valve body is equipped with at least one first port <b>50</b> formed in the upper housing <b>32</b> for admitting fluid from the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b> into the wash pipe <b>24</b>. A piston <b>36</b> is sealingly and slidably disposed in a chamber <b>38</b> defined by the valve body housings <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The piston <b>36</b> is movable from a position closing the first port <b>50</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) to a position opening the first port upon actuation of the piston (described below). The piston <b>36</b> is equipped with an upper end <b>49</b> and a lower end <b>51</b>, with the surface area of upper end <b>49</b> being less than the surface area of lower end <b>51</b> so that ambient wellbore fluid pressure urges the piston <b>36</b> to the closed position when the wash pipe is initially positioned in the wellbore <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The piston has a head or flanged portion <b>40</b> disposed for slidable movement within an enlarged portion of the valve body chamber <b>38</b>. The flanged piston portion <b>40</b> divides the enlarged chamber portion into first (upper) and second (lower) enlarged chambers <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. The piston flange <b>40</b> carries a seal <b>46</b> that seals against a portion of the lower housing <b>34</b> that defines the enlarged portion of the chamber <b>38</b>, and thereby isolates the first enlarged chamber <b>42</b> from the second enlarged chamber <b>44</b>. The piston <b>36</b> also carries a seal <b>47</b> that seals against a lower portion of lower housing <b>34</b>, thereby sealing the lower end of the second (or lower) enlarged chamber <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The upper valve body housing <b>32</b> is further equipped with a second port <b>55</b> for admitting fluid pressure from the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b> to the first enlarged chamber <b>42</b> via an internal conduit <b>57</b> of the second port <b>55</b>. In this manner, wellbore fluid pressure may be applied to urge the piston to the position opening the first port <b>50</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). The upper valve housing <b>32</b> further includes a flow control device, such as a solenoid valve <b>91</b>, powered by a battery <b>91</b><i>b </i>and moveable between positions opening and closing the conduit <b>57</b> of the second port <b>55</b> upon actuation of the solenoid valve <b>91</b> via a conductor <b>77</b> by a pressure-sensitive device, which will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>A, is carried by the wash pipe <b>24</b> independently of the valves <b>30</b> for sensing the pressure within the isolated lower wellbore annulus <b>23</b> while gravel packing. The pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> can include, but is not limited to, a rupture disk or a pressure pulse telemetry device in which an amplitude or frequency modulated pressure pulse triggers the device. A particular embodiment of the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> includes a battery <b>81</b>, a pressure transducer <b>83</b>, a processor <b>85</b>, and a capacitor/transmitter <b>87</b>. The battery <b>81</b> provides power for the processor <b>85</b> and the capacitor/transmitter <b>87</b>. The pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> interacts with a movable chamber divider <b>89</b>, exposed to wellbore fluid pressure on its upper side, and a solenoid valve <b>91</b> of each valve <b>30</b>. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the solenoid valve <b>91</b> can be replaced by other flow control devices, including an explosive or burstable element.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Hydraulic communication between the pressure transducer <b>83</b> and the ambient wellbore fluid is achieved through communication port <b>79</b> of the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b>. The internal space around the pressure transducer and the communication port may be filled with a non-conductive hydraulic fluid. The port <b>79</b> may contain a filter to provide both a flow restriction against hydraulic fluid loss during deployment, and also act as a filter once wellbore fluid is in contact with the port opening.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The pressure transducer <b>83</b> converts a pressure signal (i.e., a sensed wellbore pressure) to an electrical signal and provides that electrical signal to the processor <b>85</b>. The processor <b>85</b> analyzes the electrical signal to determine whether a threshold pressure condition exists in the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b>, and, if so, commands the capacitor/transmitter <b>87</b> to send an actuation signal to the solenoid valve <b>91</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). When solenoid valve <b>91</b> is actuated to open the conduit <b>57</b> of the valve port <b>55</b>, the lower side of chamber divider <b>89</b> is exposed to the reduced pressure (e.g., atmospheric) of first enlarged valve chamber <b>42</b>. The resulting pressure differential across the chamber divider <b>89</b> moves the chamber divider towards the conduit <b>57</b>, causing hydraulic fluid within the conduit <b>57</b> and the chamber <b>42</b> to bear on the piston flanged portion <b>40</b> and displace the piston <b>36</b> to an open position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). This sequence of events, from pressure sensing to piston displacement, is very rapid (e.g., within seconds or fractions of a second) and occurs on a real-time basis while gravel packing operations are being conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference again to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B, the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> is preferably carried by the wash pipe <b>24</b> such that the pressure-sensitive device is positioned adjacent the wellbore packer assembly <b>18</b> under the upper section of the screen <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the device <b>48</b> is conveniently placed at or near a location of high absolute pressure within the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b>, and more particularly within the inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a</i>. The pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> actuates one or more diverter valves <b>30</b> by transmitting one or more actuation signals from the capacitor/transmitter <b>87</b>. The one or more actuation signals may be transmitted wirelessly, e.g., using a transmitter coil (not shown), such as a radio frequency (“RF”) antenna, other electromagnetic (“EM”) transmitter means, inductive coupling, or by a conductor <b>77</b> extending between the controller and the valves. The conductor <b>77</b> may include one or more insulated electrical wires, optical fibers, etc., carried along the conduit that defines wash pipe <b>24</b>, in a similar manner to that employed in the art of wired drill pipe (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,434).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As mentioned above, the solenoid valve <b>91</b> of one of more of the valves <b>30</b> is actuated when the pressure sensed by the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> corresponds to one or more threshold pressure conditions. The device <b>48</b> may, e.g., be responsive to an absolute pressure of the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b> (or, more precisely, inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a</i>), or a pressure differential across the wall of the wash pipe <b>24</b>. Pressure condition criteria to trigger a response can include proximity to a target absolute pressure—particularly local fracture pressure, the slope or rate of change of the sensed pressure with respect to time, observed trends in a pressure profile produced at the surface, or a combination of criteria being simultaneously met. Additionally, the threshold pressure conditions can be manually dictated (e.g., overriding downhole pressure condition criteria) from the surface when appropriate telemetry or communication means exists between the pressure responsive device <b>48</b> and surface. More particular explanation of a pressure pulse telemetry device can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,796,699, incorporated herein for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the pressure-sensitive member <b>48</b> commands solenoid valve <b>91</b> to its “open” state, the solenoid valve allows fluid pressure communication between the inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the enlarged first chamber <b>42</b> of one or more valves <b>30</b>. Such fluid pressure communication energizes the valve chamber <b>42</b> to induce sliding movement of the valve piston <b>36</b>. The first port <b>50</b> can therefore provide fluid communication between the inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the interior of the wash pipe <b>24</b>. The piston <b>36</b> carries seals <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, that seal against the portion of the upper housing <b>32</b> that define chamber <b>38</b> to prevent or allow such fluid communication, depending on the position of the piston <b>36</b>. The seal <b>53</b> also serves to seal the upper end of the enlarged first (upper) chamber <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Additional safeguards, such as a closure mechanism for selectively closing each of the first valve ports <b>50</b>, may be employed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows schematically a valve embodiment <b>30</b>′ that employs a plurality of radially-distributed first ports <b>50</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each of the first ports <b>50</b> is equipped with a check valve in the form of a flapper valve <b>31</b> to ensure fluid flows through each first port <b>50</b> in one direction: from the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b> to the wash pipe <b>24</b>. The flapper valve <b>31</b> includes a plurality of pivotally mounted plates <b>31</b><i>p </i>that are adapted for rotation from an open position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to a closed position (not shown) should the fluid pressure within the wash pipe <b>24</b> exceed the ambient wellbore fluid pressure within the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b> (in particular, within the inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a</i>) when the piston <b>36</b> is moved to an open position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> shows a diverter valve embodiment <b>30</b>″ employing a flapper valve <b>31</b>′ having a single pivotally-mounted plate <b>31</b><i>p</i>′ for closing a first port <b>50</b>′. The plate <b>31</b><i>p</i>′ cooperates with a cover plate <b>33</b>, equipped with a central opening <b>33</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), to prevent fluid within the wash pipe <b>24</b> from exiting through the first port <b>50</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be appreciated that the above-described diverter valve embodiments <b>30</b>′ and <b>30</b>″ have utility independent of the wash pipe <b>24</b> described herein. Thus, e.g., an open-ended conduit employing an array of such diverter valves would allow an operator to “spot” (i.e., accurately place) fluids such as Schlumberger's MudSOLVE™ treatment fluid directly after gravel packing is achieved, in a one-trip operation. This would eliminate the need to retrieve the service tool S from the wellbore <b>10</b> after gravel packing and subsequently run into the wellbore again with a fluid-spotting tool. The fluids could therefore be spotted through the open end of the conduit without risk of inadvertent release through one of the diverter valves, because fluid pressure applied in the conduit would force such diverter valves to closed positions, ensuring that the fluids exited the open end of the conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> are sequential, cross-sectional representations of the inventive valve employing a further embodiment of a closure mechanism in accordance with the present invention. In the first position depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the piston <b>36</b> is initially urged to a closed position by the ambient wellbore pressure inducing a greater force against lower piston end area <b>51</b> than upper piston end area <b>49</b>. In the second position depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the piston <b>36</b> has been urged to an open position under actuation of the solenoid valve <b>91</b> by the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>). In this embodiment, the second enlarged chamber <b>44</b> of the valve body includes a burn chamber <b>44</b><i>a </i>housing a propellant <b>44</b><i>p </i>and an igniter system <b>44</b><i>i </i>for generating pressure for urging the piston <b>36</b> from the position opening the first port <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) to the position closing the first port, as depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. The igniter <b>44</b><i>i </i>is actuated by a signal from the capacitor/transmitter <b>87</b> of the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> via a conductor <b>75</b>. The actuation signal is transmitted upon the sensing of a particular mud-pulse signal (generated, e.g., via conventional mud-pulse telemetry means) by the pressure transducer <b>83</b> of the pressure sensitive device <b>48</b>. The propellant may include, e.g., a solid fuel pack having materials that generate pressure as they ignite and burn. The second enlarged chamber <b>44</b> further includes a pair of movable chamber dividers <b>44</b><i>b</i>, <b>44</b><i>c </i>that isolate a volume <b>45</b> of hydraulic fluid therebetween so as to enable the pressure generated in the burn chamber <b>44</b><i>a </i>to be transferred to the piston flange <b>40</b> while retaining the combustion products within the burn chamber. When the piston <b>36</b> is thereby returned to the closed position, fluid pumped downwardly though the wash pipe <b>24</b> is forced to exit the open end <b>25</b> thereof (assuming the crossover <b>28</b> is closed or removed).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A gravel packing operation utilizing the present invention will now be described. The packing operation begins by placing lower completion equipment including the packer <b>18</b>, packer extension <b>20</b>, and screen <b>22</b> within the wellbore <b>10</b> using the service tool S to run the entire assembly into the wellbore. The initial steps include setting the packer <b>18</b> within the casing <b>16</b> and “releasing” the service tool S from the packer, thereby leaving the assembly consisting of the packer <b>18</b>, packer extension <b>20</b>, and screen <b>22</b> permanently located with respect to the casing <b>16</b>. The service tool S is then “switched” to gravel pack position such that a crossover <b>28</b>, diverter valves <b>30</b>, and the open lower end <b>25</b> of the wash pipe <b>24</b> are properly positioned within the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b>. Because the chamber <b>38</b> of each valve <b>30</b> is initially set at atmospheric pressure, and because the surface area of the lower end <b>51</b> of each valve piston <b>36</b> is greater than the surface area of the upper end <b>49</b> of the piston <b>36</b>, each piston <b>36</b> is hydraulically biased to its upward position as the service tool S is lowered into position within the wellbore <b>10</b> and casing <b>16</b>. This ensures that port <b>50</b> remains closed until purposely opened (or, equivalently, covering and sealing holes in the wash pipe <b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Gravel slurry is pumped through the service tool S into the wash pipe <b>24</b> and ejected via the crossover <b>28</b> into the isolated outer lower annulus <b>27</b><i>b</i>. The gravel slurry may be of various concentrations of particulates and the carrier fluid can be of various viscosities. In substantially horizontal wellbores, and particularly with a low-viscosity carrier fluid such as water, the placement or deposition of gravel generally occurs in two stages. During the initial stage, known as the “alpha wave”, the gravel precipitates as it travels downwardly to form a continuous succession of dunes <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Depending on factors such as slurry velocity, slurry viscosity, sand concentration, and the volume of the isolated lower annulus <b>23</b>, each dune <b>54</b> will grow in height until the fluid velocity passing over the top of dune <b>54</b> is sufficient to erode the gravel and deposit it on the downstream side of dune <b>54</b>. The process of building up a dune <b>54</b> to a sustainable height and deposition on the downstream dune side to initiate the build-up of each successive dune <b>54</b> is repeated as the alpha wave progresses to the toe T of wellbore <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As the alpha wave travels to the toe T and the gravel settles out, the carrier fluid preferably travels in outer lower annulus <b>27</b><i>b </i>or passes through screen <b>22</b> and enters inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a </i>and continues to the toe where it is picked up by wash pipe <b>24</b> via open end <b>25</b>, and then conveyed to the surface. A proper layer of “filter cake,” or “mud cake” (a relatively thin layer of drilling fluid material lining wellbore <b>10</b>) helps prevent excess leak-off to the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the alpha wave reaches the toe T of the wellbore <b>10</b>, the gravel begins to backfill the portion of the lower annulus <b>23</b> left unfilled by the alpha wave. This is the second stage of the gravel pack and is referred to as the “beta wave.” As the beta wave progresses toward the heel H (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the wellbore <b>10</b> and gravel is deposited, the carrier fluid passes through screen <b>22</b> and enters inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a</i>. So long as the diverter valves <b>30</b> remain closed, the carrier fluid must make its way to the open end <b>25</b> near the toe T to be returned to the surface. As the beta wave gets farther and farther from the toe T, the carrier fluid entering the inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a </i>must travel farther and farther to reach the open end <b>25</b> of the wash pipe <b>24</b>. The flowpath to the toe through the outer lower annulus <b>27</b><i>b </i>is effectively blocked because of the deposited gravel. As is common in fluid flow, the pressure in wellbore <b>10</b> tends to increase due to the increased resistance resulting from the longer and more restricted flowpath.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a typical plot of expected pressure in wellbore <b>10</b> with a prior art wash pipe having no diverter valves therein. For reference, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> also shows the limiting pressure or fracture pressure of the formation, above which damage to the formation may occur. Pumping operations are generally halted just below fracture pressure. This early termination of pumping results in an incomplete gravel pack.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a typical pressure profile expected with the use of diverter valves <b>30</b> and a pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> in accordance with the present invention. The valves <b>30</b> are strategically placed along the lower length of the wash pipe <b>24</b>. Proper placement of the valves <b>30</b> and the determination of threshold pressure conditions for pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> vary according to the pressure environment of a particular wellbore <b>10</b>. This pressure environment can be modeled or simulated using known computational techniques for estimating wellbore pressure. Using such techniques allows engineering estimates for optimal placement of valves <b>30</b> and selection of an appropriate pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>B show the locations of three diverter valves <b>30</b> and the pressure plot corresponding to their use with a pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> designed for responding to the respective pressure threshold conditions associated with the three valves. The respective valve locations are designated by points A, B, and C depicted on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>B. In operation, after the alpha wave reaches the toe T and the beta wave reaches valve point A, the wellbore pressure—which has been sensed by the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> throughout gravel packing—is elevated to a magnitude just sufficient to correspond to a threshold pressure condition P<sub>Thresh </sub>of the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b>. This triggers the transmission of an actuation signal from the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> to the valve <b>30</b> positioned at point A, thereby exposing the enlarged first (upper) chamber <b>42</b> of that valve <b>30</b> to the pressure in inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a</i>. This pressure exceeds the atmospheric pressure in the second (lower) enlarged chamber <b>44</b>, causing the piston <b>36</b> of that valve to move downwardly, exposing the first port <b>50</b> to the inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a</i>. With the first port <b>50</b> in its “open” state, the carrier fluid no longer must travel to the open end <b>25</b> of the wash pipe <b>24</b> to return to the surface. Instead, the carrier fluid enters the wash pipe <b>24</b> through the first port <b>50</b> at valve point A. This allows the wellbore pressure to drop, as shown in the vertical, linear portion of the pressure profile adjacent point A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As the beta wave continues up wellbore <b>10</b> toward the heel H, the annulus pressure will increase as the flow path again lengthens. However, upon passing point B, the pressure will again be sufficient to correspond to the threshold pressure condition P<sub>Thresh </sub>of the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b>. As before, this results in actuation of the diverter valve <b>30</b> at point B by the pressure-sensitive device. That creates a flow path from inner lower annulus <b>27</b><i>a </i>into the wash pipe <b>24</b> at point B, thus relieving the wellbore pressure again. This process is repeated for each additional diverter valve <b>30</b>, as illustrated again at point C.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> also shows the relative time a standard gravel pack (without diverter valves <b>30</b> or pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b>) will be allowed to run until halted at the pressure P<sub>c </sub>anticipated at point C, just below the fracture pressure. It also shows the additional relative packing time permitted when diverter valves <b>30</b> are used according to the present invention. The term “relative” time is used to indicate the controlling factor is really wellbore versus fracture pressure since time van be extended or shortened by varying other parameters. However, by controlling pressure, extended relative pumping times can be gained. Additional time is gained because the open diverter valves <b>30</b> reduce the resistance to the return of carrier fluids to the surface due to shortened flow paths. If diverter valves <b>30</b> are properly chosen, the gravel pack operation can be run until the screens are completely covered, while never exceeding the fracture pressure. Although the diverter valves <b>30</b> are described as being employed with a pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> having a plurality of respective threshold (actuating) pressure conditions, it will be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art that the pressure-sensitive device may be designed to open all of the diverter valves carried by the wash pipe upon the presence of a single threshold pressure condition within the isolated lower wellbore annulus <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It will be further appreciated that the rate of fluid return upwardly through the wash pipe <b>24</b> can be regulated using a choke, as is well known in the art. Such use of a choke gives an operator an additional means of control over the actuation of the diverter valve(s) <b>30</b> by the pressure-sensitive device <b>48</b> by allowing the operator to selectively increase the wellbore pressure to the actuation level, should the operator so choose.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It will be still further appreciated that the present invention admits to a number of advantages, including but not limited to: wellbore pressure control without the need for monitoring/locating the beta wave; tolerance to unexpected events such as high leak-off rate to the formation and/or drop in proppant concentration; freedom of diverter valve locations; enhanced reliability by interconnection of diverter valves; adaptive to multiple pressure-sensing locations (e.g., in annulus above packer); easily retrievable; simplified control/actuation logic with reduced risk of false actuation; and not dependent on the use of a polished bore receptacle (PBR) in the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although only a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the following claims.</p>

Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures.
