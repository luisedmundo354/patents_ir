<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a discharge lamp ballast apparatus for turning on discharge lamps used as headlights of automobiles and the like, as lights in indoor or outdoor facilities, warehouses, factories and the like, or as street lights, and more particularly to a discharge lamp ballast apparatus for controlling, in response to the total current value flowing into a load, the current fed from a DC power supply for operating the discharge lamp ballast apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Among the discharge lamps, high intensity discharge lamps (HID) such as metal halide valves, high pressure sodium valves and mercury valves have advantages such as large luminous flux, high lamp efficiency and long life. Thus, they have been used as lights in indoor or outdoor facilities, warehouses or factories, or as street lights. Recently in particular, they have been used as headlights of vehicles such as automobiles. To turn on such a discharge lamp, it is necessary to apply a prescribed voltage to the valve at the start, and to superimpose a high voltage start pulse thereon. Thus, the ballast apparatus includes a stabilized DC power supply circuit (DC-DC converter or the like) for lighting the discharge lamp stably, an inverter circuit (AC power supply circuit) for converting the DC voltage to a rectangular wave AC, and anigniter (start circuit) for generating a high voltage starting pulse. In addition, to bring the DC power supply circuit and inverter circuit into operation, their power is supplied from the DC power supply such as a battery. In this case, the power supply must be controlled to prevent an overcurrent. As conventional discharge lamp ballast apparatuses that can prevent the overcurrent, the following examples are known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A first conventional example relates to a technique of fail-safe operation in case of a ground fault of the electric wiring of a discharge lamp due to some failure. It has a discharge lamp current detecting resistor provided across a low voltage common terminal of an H bridge circuit constituting an inverter circuit and a ground (GND). If the ground fault occurs, the current detecting resistor detects it, and the switching transistors (MOS transistors) constituting the H bridge circuit are turned off in response to the detection, thereby preventing the overcurrent from the DC power supply (for example, see Relevant Reference 1).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A second conventional example relates to a technique for limiting the power supply current to prevent an excessive increase of the power supply current when the DC power supply voltage decreases. It includes a DC power supply circuit (DC-DC converter) using a transformer of the DC/DC converter which has a primary winding and secondary winding isolated from each other; a current detecting resistor provided on the primary winding side for detecting the input current (power supply current) to the DC power supply circuit; and a current limiting controller for limiting the input current to the DC power supply circuit in response to the detection signal, thereby preventing the overcurrent from the DC power supply (for example, see Relevant Reference 2).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides the foregoing examples, the following Relevant References 3-6 are enumerated as conventional techniques relating to the power supply in the discharge lamp ballast apparatuses.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Japanese patent application laid-open No. 2003-323992.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The conventional discharge lamp ballast apparatuses are configured as described above. In particular, the first conventional example relates to the technique of preventing the overcurrent at the ground fault, which does not handle the factors other than the ground fault such as the voltage reduction of the DC power supply as in the second conventional example. The boosting transformer of the DC/DC converter used by the DC power supply circuit (DC-DC converter) of the first conventional example is a step-up autotransformer. The step-up autotransformer is preferable as the DC-DC converter because it has a smaller winding and a smaller core. Accordingly, if the first conventional example could include the current detecting resistor between the DC power supply and the ballast apparatus in the same manner as the second conventional example, the first conventional example would be able to achieve the effect of the second conventional example, which would be vastly preferable. However, when the DC/DC converter uses the step-up autotransformer as its transformer, the load current from the DC power supply flows not only through the DC power supply circuit, but also to the post-stage inverter circuit and the like, which differs from the second conventional example that uses the DC/DC converter transformer having the primary winding and secondary winding isolated from each other. In other words, the load current from the single DC power supply is split to a plurality of load circuits such as the DC power supply circuit and inverter circuit. Accordingly, even if the current detecting resistor is provided between the DC power supply and the ballast apparatus as in the second conventional example, the potential on the load side of the current detecting resistor changes with the current. Because of the changes, the voltage across the resistor for detecting the output current flowing through the inverter circuit varies, and this presents a problem in that the power supply current cannot be detected accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is implemented to solve the foregoing problem. Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a discharge lamp ballast apparatus capable of detecting the power supply current fed from the single DC power supply accurately, and capable of controlling the current fed from the DC power supply in response to the detection result in the discharge lamp ballast apparatus with a configuration in which the load current from the single DC power supply is split to a plurality of load circuits such as the DC power supply circuit and inverter circuit as in the case where the step-up autotransformer is used as the transformer constituting the DC power supply circuit (DC-DC converter).</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, a discharge lamp ballast apparatus includes: a power supply circuit for converting a voltage from a DC power supply, which is connected to a plurality of load circuits, to a prescribed DC voltage, and for converting the prescribed DC voltage to an AC voltage to be supplied to a discharge lamp; and a start circuit for generating a high voltage pulse and for superimposing the high voltage pulse on the AC voltage to start discharge of the discharge lamp, wherein a controller controls a current supplied from the DC power supply in response to a total value of currents flowing through the plurality of load circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, it offers an advantage of being able to control the current appropriately which is supplied from the DC power supply to the plurality of load circuits.</p>

The amplifier <b>705</b> consists of an operational amplifier, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the configuration, the resistor <b>701</b> (R<b>3</b>) is connected to the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> (R<b>1</b>), and the resistor <b>702</b> (R<b>4</b>) is connected to the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>). Through the two resistors <b>701</b> (R<b>3</b>) and <b>702</b> (R<b>4</b>), the voltage signal corresponding to the primary side current of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b>, which is detected by the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> (R<b>1</b>), and the voltage signal corresponding to the output current of the inverter circuit <b>3</b> onward, which is detected by the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b>, (R<b>2</b>) are combined, and the combined voltage signal is input to the non-inverting input terminal (+terminal) of the amplifier <b>705</b>. To the inverting input terminal (−terminal), the resistors <b>703</b> (R<b>5</b>) and <b>704</b> (R<b>6</b>) are connected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The amplifier <b>705</b>, amplifying the combined voltage signal, detects and outputs a signal Sa corresponding to the total current value of the primary side current of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> flowing through the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> (R<b>1</b>) and the output current of the inverter circuit <b>3</b> onward flowing through the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>) Thus, the signal Sa is obtained which indicates the total current value corresponding to the current Ib fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, the amplifier <b>705</b> using the operational amplifier operates as a non-inverting amplifier, and its voltage amplification factor Av across the input and output is given by Av=1+(R<b>5</b>/R<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As for ratios between the resistors, they can be placed at (R<b>2</b>/R<b>1</b>)=(R<b>4</b>/R<b>3</b>)=(R<b>6</b>/R<b>5</b>) considering the resistance values of the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> (R<b>1</b>) and output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The signal Sa, which represents the total current value and is output from the amplifier <b>705</b>, is delivered to the controller <b>8</b>. In response to the signal Sa representing the total current value, the controller <b>8</b> carries out the switching control of the switching transistor <b>24</b> of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> to control its output power, thereby controlling the current Ib fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b>. In this case, the controller <b>8</b> controls the output power in such a manner that the DC voltage Vo of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> is maintained nearly at constant within the overcurrent limiting value of the DC power supply <b>1</b>, which is set in advance by the signal Sa representing the total current value. In contrast, when the signal Sa representing the total current value exceeds the overcurrent limiting value, the controller <b>8</b> limits the output power of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b>, thereby imposing the overcurrent limitation on the current fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, the present embodiment 1 is configured such that the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> detects the primary side current value divided from the DC power supply <b>1</b> to the primary side of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b>; the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> detects the output current value divided from the DC power supply <b>1</b> to the inverter circuit <b>3</b> onward; the total current detector <b>7</b> detects the total current value flowing into the plurality of load circuits such as the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> and the inverter circuit <b>3</b> from the primary side current value and output current value detected; and the controller <b>8</b> controls the output power by controlling the switching transistor <b>24</b> of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> in response to the total current value detected, thereby controlling the current Ib fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b>. As a result, the discharge lamp ballast apparatus, which is configured in such a manner that the load current is split from the single DC power supply <b>1</b> to the plurality of load circuits such as the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> and inverter circuit <b>3</b> in the case where the autotransformer <b>21</b> is used by the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b>, can detect the current value corresponding to the power supply current value flowing out of the single DC power supply <b>1</b> accurately, and can control the current Ib fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b> appropriately in response to the detected result.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the controller <b>8</b> is configured such that if the signal Sa representing the total current value exceeds the preset overcurrent limiting value of the DC power supply <b>1</b>, the controller <b>8</b> limits the output power of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> to impose the overcurrent limitation on the current fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the controller <b>8</b> can protect the load circuits such as the DC power supply <b>1</b> and DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> from the overcurrent.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, since the detecting circuit based on the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> and the detecting circuit based on the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> are independent of each other, they can each detect the current accurately without interference.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, the total current detector <b>7</b>A is configured such that it sums up and amplifies with the amplifier <b>705</b> the primary side current value detected by the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> and the output current value detected by the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b>. Thus, it can add the two values without error by the simple circuit configuration, and can detect the current value corresponding to the power supply current value flowing from the DC power supply <b>1</b> to the plurality of load circuits.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of a total current detector <b>7</b>B of the discharge lamp ballast apparatus of an embodiment 2 in accordance with the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the same reference numerals as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> designate the same components, and their description is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the total current detector <b>7</b>B of the present embodiment 2 has a comparator <b>706</b> provided at the post-stage of the summing amplifier circuit composed of the same amplifier <b>705</b> as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An integrating function is added to the comparator <b>706</b> by providing an integrating circuit consisting of a resistor <b>707</b> (R<b>7</b>) and a capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>). The integrating function of the integrating circuit is provided for preventing reaction to instantaneous fluctuations such as noise. In addition, the comparator <b>706</b> is composed of an operational amplifier, for example, and its non-inverting input terminal (+terminal) is set at a voltage Vs obtained by dividing the DC voltage Vcc with a resistor <b>709</b> (R<b>8</b>) and a resistor <b>710</b> (R<b>9</b>) The voltage Vs is used as a reference value for the overcurrent decision (called “reference value Vs” from now on). The reference value Vs is obtained by dividing the stabilized DC voltage Vcc such as 3 V or 5 V, thereby achieving the stabilized reference value Vs without fluctuations.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The comparator <b>706</b>, resistor <b>709</b> (R<b>8</b>) and resistor <b>710</b> (R<b>9</b>) constitute a comparing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With the foregoing configuration, the signal Sa representing the total current value, which is output from the amplifier <b>705</b>, is supplied to the inverting input terminal (−terminal) of the comparator <b>706</b> via the resistor <b>707</b> (R<b>7</b>), and is compared with the reference value Vs set at the non-inverting input terminal (+terminal). In this case, the signal Sa representing the total current value undergoes the integration by the integrating circuit consisting of the resistor <b>707</b> (R<b>7</b>) and capacitor <b>708</b> (Cl). Thus, even if the signal Sa representing the total current value fluctuates instantaneously, the comparator <b>706</b> can circumvent the effect of the fluctuations. For example, even if the signal Sa representing the total current value becomes an instantaneous large current because of noise or the like, the comparator <b>706</b> is impervious to it. Incidentally, as for the values of the resistor <b>707</b> (R<b>7</b>) and capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>) that determine the time constant of the integrating circuit, they can be set flexibly, and suitably setting the values makes it possible to achieve intended response characteristics with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the comparison by the comparator <b>706</b>, when the signal Sa representing the total current value, which is input via the integrating circuit consisting of the resistor <b>707</b> (R<b>7</b>) and the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>), does not exceed the reference value Vs, the comparator <b>706</b> sets the controller <b>8</b> at a normal control state.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In contrast, when the signal Sa representing the total current value exceeds the reference value Vs in the comparison by the comparator <b>706</b>, the comparator <b>706</b> supplies the controller <b>8</b> with the signal (Sb) instructing it to perform the overcurrent limitation. According to the instruction signal supplied, the controller <b>8</b> limits the output power by the switching control of the switching transistor <b>24</b> of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b>, thereby imposing the overcurrent limitation on the current fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, according to the present embodiment <b>2</b>, the total current detector <b>7</b>B is configured in such a manner that the amplifier <b>705</b> sums up and amplifies the signals corresponding to the primary side current value detected by the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> and the output current value detected by the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b>; the comparator <b>706</b>, receiving the output of the amplifier <b>705</b> via the resistor <b>707</b> (R<b>7</b>) constituting the integrating circuit, compares the output with the reference value Vs; and when the output of the amplifier <b>705</b> exceeds the reference value Vs, the comparator <b>706</b> supplies the controller <b>8</b> with the signal Sb instructing it to limit the output power of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> to impose the overcurrent limitation on the current fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the total current detector <b>7</b>C according to the present embodiment 3 is configured in such a manner that an amplifier <b>711</b> (called “first amplifier 711” in the present embodiment 3) is provided for amplifying the voltage signal representing the output current of the inverter circuit <b>3</b> onward, which is detected by the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>); and the amplified output is supplied to the non-inverting input terminal (+terminal) of the amplifier <b>705</b> (called “second amplifier 705” in the present embodiment 3) constituting the summing amplifier circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> via the resistor <b>712</b> (R<b>10</b>) Here, the first amplifier <b>711</b> constitutes an amplifier circuit whose voltage amplification factor Av<b>1</b> is given by Av<b>1</b>=K.</p>

In this case, the voltage amplification factor Av<b>2</b> from the input to the output is given by Av<b>2</b>=1+(R<b>11</b>/R<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is preferable that the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> (R<b>1</b>) and output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>) have as low resistance as possible from the viewpoint of reducing the power consumption.

In addition, the current flowing through the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>) is much smaller than the current flowing through the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b> (R<b>1</b>). Accordingly, amplifying the voltage signal from the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>) with the first amplifier <b>711</b> can prevent the reduction in the detecting accuracy of the current even when the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b> (R<b>2</b>) has a low resistance.</p>

The combined voltage signal is supplied to the non-inverting input terminal (+terminal) of the second amplifier <b>705</b>, and the following operation is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, according to the present embodiment <b>4</b>, the total current detector <b>7</b>D is configured in such a manner that the first amplifier <b>711</b> amplifies the signal of the output current value detected by the output current detecting resistor <b>6</b>; the comparator <b>715</b> compares with the reference value Vs the signal produced by combining the output signal of the first amplifier <b>711</b> and the signal representing the primary side current value detected by the primary side current detecting resistor <b>5</b>; and the comparator <b>715</b> supplies the controller <b>8</b> with the signal Se that instructs the controller <b>8</b> to impose the overcurrent limitation on the current fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b> by limiting the output power of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> when the signal Sd representing the total current value exceeds the reference value Vs. As a result, the primary side current of the DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> is reduced, and hence the current flowing from the DC power supply <b>1</b> is limited, thereby being able to protect the load circuits such as the DC power supply <b>1</b> and DC power supply circuit <b>2</b> from the overcurrent.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, since the comparator <b>715</b> is provided with the integrating circuit consisting of the resistors <b>701</b> (R<b>3</b>) and <b>712</b> (R<b>10</b>) and the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>), even if the signal Sd representing the total current value increases sharply to an instantaneous large current due to noise or the like, for example, the comparator <b>715</b> can circumvent its effect.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, using the second amplifier <b>705</b> of the embodiment 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) as the comparator <b>715</b> of the present embodiment 4 enables the integration of the summing amplifier and the overcurrent detecting comparator. Furthermore, adding the integrating circuit including the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>) and others to the integrating circuit enables the response characteristics unresponsive to the instantaneous large current. Thus, it can implement the functions of the current addition, comparison and response characteristics necessary for the overcurrent limitation with a simple configuration.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the same reference numerals as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> designate the same components, and their description is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the total current detector <b>7</b>E of the present embodiment 5 includes, in addition to the configuration of the embodiment 4, a transistor (PNP type) <b>718</b>, and a resistor <b>719</b> (R<b>15</b>) and a resistor <b>720</b> (R<b>16</b>) for setting the base voltage of the transistor <b>718</b>. The additional portion constitutes an integrating circuit voltage setting means.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The purpose of the transistor <b>718</b> and others is to improve the response characteristic provided by adding the integrating circuit composed of the resistors <b>701</b> (R<b>3</b>) and <b>712</b> (R<b>10</b>) and the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>) to the comparator <b>715</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The improvement of the response characteristic by the transistor <b>718</b> and others will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram showing relationships of the current Ib (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) fed from the DC power supply <b>1</b> against time, and relationship of the output signal Sf of the comparator <b>715</b> against time: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates the current Ib; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates the output signal (voltage signal) Sf.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, consider the case where the transistor <b>718</b> is not provided. In this case, when the current Ib is in a state of a low input current (steady-state current) Ib<b>1</b> before the timing ta during which no overcurrent occurs, the output signal Sf (voltage) of the comparator <b>715</b> having the integrating function is nearly equal to the power supply voltage (Vcc) fed to the comparator <b>715</b> as shown by a broken line. When the current Ib becomes the overcurrent Ib<b>2</b> after the timing ta onward, the output signal Sf of the comparator <b>715</b> begins to drop as shown by the broken line. The level at which the voltage drop starts is nearly equal to the power supply voltage. In this case, the slope of the drop of the output signal Sf is determined by the integration constant of the resistors <b>701</b> (R<b>3</b>) and <b>712</b> (R<b>10</b>) and the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>). Thus, when the level of the output signal Sf for starting the overcurrent limitation in the controller <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is Sfo, the time period for the output signal Sf to start dropping and reach Sfo is Tm.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In contrast with this, when the transistor <b>718</b> is provided, the operation proceeds as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the current Ib is in the low input current (steady-state current) Ib<b>1</b> state before the timing ta, during which no overcurrent occurs, the transistor <b>718</b> is kept on to bring its collector (C) and emitter (E) into conduction, so that the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>) is short-circuited. To achieve this, the base (B) is supplied with a prescribed voltage which is obtained by dividing a stabilized voltage such as 5 V power supply voltage Vcc by the resistor <b>719</b> (R<b>15</b>) and resistor <b>720</b> (R<b>16</b>) to bring the transistor into conduction. In this ON state, the emitter voltage Ve of the transistor <b>718</b> is given by the following expression when the transistor <b>718</b> has Vbe=0.7 (V).
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Ve</i>={(<i>R</i>16<i>·Vcc</i>)/(<i>R</i>15<i>+R</i>16)}+0.7   (V)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The solid line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the emitter voltage Ve when the transistor <b>718</b> is in the ON state. The emitter voltage Ve is also the level of the output signal Sf of the comparator <b>715</b>, which is kept constant as long as the power supply voltage Vcc is not varied. Accordingly, the level at the drop start timing when the current Ib becomes the overcurrent Ib<b>2</b> after the timing ta onward is equal to the emitter voltage Ve. As a result, the drop time for the output voltage Sf to reach the output signal Sfo for starting the overcurrent limitation is Tn. As for the down slope, it is determined by the integration constant of the resistors <b>701</b> (R<b>3</b>) and <b>712</b> (R<b>10</b>) and the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>) as in the case where no transistor <b>718</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The dropping time period Tn is shorter than the dropping time period Tm in which the transistor <b>718</b> is not provided, thereby being able to shorten the time period for starting the overcurrent limitation, and to accelerate the response characteristic of the overcurrent limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The basic operation other than the foregoing description is the same as that of the embodiment 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and its description is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, the present embodiment 5 is configured in such a manner that the total current detector <b>7</b>E includes, in addition to the configuration of the total current detector <b>7</b>D of the embodiment 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the integrating circuit voltage setting means for limiting the output voltage of the integrating circuit composed of the resistors <b>701</b> (R<b>3</b>) and <b>712</b> (R<b>10</b>) and the capacitor <b>708</b> (C<b>1</b>) provided to the comparator <b>715</b>. Thus, the present embodiment is waiting with limiting the output of the integrating circuit (the emitter of the transistor <b>718</b>) to the prescribed voltage (Ve), and hence it can shorten the time period until the comparator <b>715</b> supplies the controller <b>8</b> with the signal Sf for instructing the start of the overcurrent limitation. Consequently, it can implement the integrating circuit that does not respond to the instantaneous large current, but responds to a continuous overcurrent quickly, thereby being able to carry out the overcurrent limitation with the quick response characteristic.</p>
