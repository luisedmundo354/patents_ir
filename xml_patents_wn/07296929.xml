<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention concerns a linear guide unit comprising a guide carriage that is mounted through rollers for sliding on a guide rail, and further comprising a roller chain comprising a cage for receiving the rollers, said cage being formed by spacers arranged between adjacent rollers and flexible belts arranged at two front ends of the rollers for connecting the spacers to one another, said roller chain being arranged for rotating in an endless roller channel comprising a load-bearing section, in which the rollers roll under load on raceways of the guide carriage and of the guide rail, a return section, that is arranged substantially parallel to the load-bearing section and in which the rollers of the roller chain are unloaded, and two deflecting sections that connect the return section and the load-bearing section endlessly to each other, said endless roller channel comprising lateral rims at both front ends of the rollers for guiding the rollers, each lateral rim comprising a groove for receiving one of the belts of the cage, said groove comprising a groove bottom, an inner groove wall for an inner belt side of the belt and an outer groove wall situated opposite the inner groove wall for an outer belt side of the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such linear rolling bearings are used, for instance, in the field of machine tools and in handling equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A linear guide unit of the pre-cited type is disclosed, for instance in EP 0 838 602 B1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> of this document shows in a partial longitudinal section, a linear guide unit in which an inner deflector and an outer deflector of the deflecting section are configured on separate parts. The lateral rim is endlessly configured along the roller channel, the groove being shaped into this integrally formed part. In the manufacturing of such a linear guide unit out of a plastic by an injection molding method, a complex injection mold is required. In the present prior art, the guide carriage has a carrier body made of steel that comprises bores for forming the return section. The injection mold extends likewise into these bores. The plastic material is also injected into the space between the bore wall and the inserted part of the injection mold. It is difficult to extract this part of the injection mold inserted into the bore without damaging the groove in the deflecting section, so that it becomes necessary to provide complex injection molds.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the invention to provide a linear guide unit of the pre-cited type that can be manufactured in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This and other objects and advantages of the invention will become obvious from the following detailed description.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention achieves the above objects by the fact that the outer groove wall and the inner groove wall of the groove in the deflecting section are formed on separate parts. When the outer groove wall is formed on a separate part, the groove bottom, the inner groove inner wall and an inner part of the lateral rim can be formed, for example, in a known manner in one piece with the return section by injection molding. The part of the injection mold inserted into the return section can be extracted without any problem by pulling it out in a straight line without interference by the groove in the region of the deflecting section. The omission of the outer groove wall on this part of the guide carriage makes this simple extraction possible.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has already been mentioned that in the prior art linear guide unit, an inner deflector and an outer deflector of the deflecting section are formed on separate parts. According to one proposition of the invention, the outer deflector comprises a deflecting shell constituting one of these parts that comprises the outer groove wall of the groove of the deflecting section. This deflecting shell can be manufactured separately and then disposed on the guide carriage to complete the endless roller channel. In this embodiment of the invention, too, a part of the injection mold inserted into the bore of the return section can be extracted without any problem.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to the outer groove wall, this deflecting shell can also comprise the groove bottom of the groove. Advantageously, the deflecting shell can likewise comprise an outer deflecting track for the rollers. In the region of the deflecting section, the outer groove wall, the groove bottom and the outer deflecting track for the rollers are then arranged on the deflecting shell. This deflecting shell can be advantageously made by injection in an injection mold.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The groove divides the lateral rim into an inner lateral rim part and an outer lateral rim part. Advantageously, the deflecting shell can comprise the outer lateral rim part of the lateral rim. In this way, a major part of the guide surfaces for the roller chain on the deflecting shell can be made in a single manufacturing step. This means that the groove bottom, the outer groove wall of the groove, the outer deflecting track and the outer lateral rim part of the lateral rim can be formed integrally on the deflecting shell.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The carrier body of the guide carriage normally comprises end caps that comprise the deflecting shells. The carrier body together with the caps can form the guide carriage.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inner groove wall of the groove of the deflecting section, the inner deflector of the deflecting section and the inner lateral rim part of the lateral rim of the deflecting section can be connected integrally to one another to thus constitute one of the aforesaid separate parts. This part can be injected in a simple manner onto the carrier body by injection molding. Particularly as far as the return section is concerned, a part of the injection mold inserted therein can be extracted again without difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention will now be described more closely with reference to embodiments of the invention illustrated in the appended drawing that contains a total of 8 figures.</p>
