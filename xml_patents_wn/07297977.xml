<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Semiconductor devices are used in a variety of electronic devices. For example, thin-film transistor technology can be used in liquid crystal display (LCD) screens. Some types of thin-film transistors have relatively slow switching speeds because of low carrier mobility. In some applications, such as LCD screens, use of thin-film transistors with relatively slow switching speeds can make it difficult to accurately render motion.</p>

In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the substrate <b>202</b> includes glass. However, substrate <b>202</b> can include any suitable substrate material or composition for implementing the various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The substrate <b>202</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a blanket coating of ITO, i.e., indium-tin oxide to form the gate electrode <b>204</b> layer. However, any number of materials can be used for the gate electrode <b>204</b>. Such materials can include transparent materials such as an n-type doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, or ZnO, and the like. Other suitable materials include metals such as In, Sn, Ga, Zn, Al, Ti, Ag, Cu, and the like. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the thickness of the gate electrode <b>204</b> is approximately 200 nm. The thickness of a gate electrode layer can vary depending on the materials used, device type, and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The gate dielectric <b>206</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is also blanket coated. Although the gate electrode <b>204</b> and gate dielectric <b>206</b> are shown as blanket coated, unpatterned layers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, they can be patterned. In the various embodiments, the gate dielectric layer <b>206</b> can include various layers of different materials having insulating properties representative of gate dielectrics. Such materials can include tantalum pentoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), Strontium Titanate (ST), Barium Strontium Titanate (BST), Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT), Strontium Bismuth Tantalate (SBT) and Bismuth Zirconium Titanate (BZT), silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), magnesium oxide (MgO), aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), hafnium(IV)oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), zirconium(IV)oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), various organic dielectric material, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In various embodiments, the gate dielectric <b>206</b> may be deposited by a low-pressure CVD process using Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>at about 430° C., and may be subsequently annealed in order to reduce leakage current characteristics. Other methods for introducing the gate dielectric layer can include various CVD and sputtering techniques and atomic layer deposition, evaporation, and the like as will be described in more detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the various embodiments, the source electrode <b>210</b> and the drain electrode <b>212</b> are separately positioned adjacent the gate dielectric <b>206</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the source and drain electrodes <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> can be formed from the same materials as those discussed in regards to the gate electrode <b>204</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the source and drain electrodes <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> have a thickness of approximately 200 nm. However, the thickness can vary depending on composition of material used, application in which the material will be used, and other factors. The choice of source and drain electrode material can vary depending on the application, device, system, etc., in which they will be used. Overall device performance is likely to vary depending on the source and drain materials. For example, in devices where a substantially transparent thin-film transistor is desired, the materials for the source, drain, and gate electrodes can be chosen for that effect.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the various embodiments, the channel <b>208</b> can be formed from a multicomponent oxide material that includes two, three, and four-component oxides that include metal cations from group 12 and group 13 of the periodic table of elements. As used herein, a multicomponent oxide is intended to mean a two, three, and four-component oxide that can include various metal cations of groups 12 and 13, as disclosed herein. Additionally, in the various embodiments including two, three, and four component oxides, each component is different. Thus, a two-component oxide can include two different metal cations, and a four-component oxide can include four different metal cations.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the various embodiments, the channel can be described as including one or more compounds of a formula, as described herein. In the various embodiments, the formula can be characterized by a series of letters that include A, B, C, D (representing cations as described herein), and O (atomic oxygen). The formula can also be characterized by a subscript x of the series of letters, e.g. Ax. In the formula, the letters, other than O, are intended to denote the identity of a metal cation selected from a defined group, and the subscripts are intended to denote the identity of the metal cation selected from the defined group. For example, if A represents the metal cation Zn, and x represents the number 2, then A<sub>x </sub>can include Zn<sub>2</sub>, e.g., two atoms of Zn.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the letter O denotes atomic oxygen as characterized by the symbol O on the periodic table of the elements. Thus, depending on the stoichiometry of a compound derived from a formula, the subscript of O, i.e., O<sub>x</sub>, in the formula can vary depending on the number of atoms of metal cations included in any given formula. For example, the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x </sub>can include the binary metal oxide: zinc-gallium oxide having the stoichiometric arrangement: Zn<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, wherein O<sub>5 </sub>denotes the number of oxygen atoms associated with this combination of ZnO and Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the formulas described herein, at least one metal cation from each of groups 12 and 13 are included in the multicomponent oxide material. For example, the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x </sub>can include a variety of three-component oxides formed from the selection of at least one group 12 and at least one group 13 metal cation. Thus, in a multicomponent oxide having two, three, or four components, at least one metal cation from each of groups 12 and 13 are included. Additionally, a selected metal cation in any given formula is selected one time. That is, in the formula, A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>, if A is selected to be zinc, then neither B nor C can include zinc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In various embodiments, the channel <b>208</b> can be formed from a multicomponent oxide material that includes one of a ternary metal oxide including: zinc-gallium oxide, cadmium-gallium oxide, and cadmium-indium oxide. In these embodiments, the metal oxide can include an atomic composition of metal(A)-to-metal(B) ratio (A:B), where A and B can independently take values from about 0.05 to about 0.95. Thus, a zinc-gallium oxide can include an atomic composition having a relative concentration of 0.05 zinc and 0.95 gallium or 0.95 zinc and 0.05 gallium. That is, the channel according to this embodiment can include various two-component oxides having an atomic composition of each component falling within the range of about 0.05 to about 0.95.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In various embodiments, the channel <b>208</b> can be formed from a multicomponent oxide material that includes one or more compounds of the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>. In such embodiments, each A can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, each B can be selected from the group of Ga, In, each C can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, Ga, In, each O can be atomic oxygen, each x can be independently a non-zero integer, and each of A, B, and C are different. That is, the value of “x” for each of the constituent elements may be different and in the embodiment of formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>, if B is zinc, then A or C will not include zinc. In these embodiments, according to the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>, four three-component oxides can be formed. The four three-component oxides can include: zinc-gallium-indium oxide, cadmium-gallium-indium oxide, zinc-cadmium-gallium oxide, and zinc-cadmium-indium oxide. Further, in these embodiments, the one or more compounds of the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x </sub>can include an atomic composition of ratio A:B:C, wherein A, B, and C, are each in a range of about 0.025 to about 0.95. Thus, for example, a zinc-gallium-indium oxide can include a concentration having a ratio, near ends of a range, of about 0.025 zinc, 0.025 gallium, and 0.95 indium or about 0.95 zinc, 0.025 gallium, and 0.025 indium or about 0.025 zinc, 0.95 gallium, and 0.025 indium or ratios of zinc/gallium/indium in between the ratio near ends of the range. That is, the channel according to this embodiment can include various three-component oxides having atomic composition ratios with the relative concentration of each component falling within the range of about 0.025 to about 0.95.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the channel <b>208</b> can be formed from a multicomponent oxide material that includes one or more compounds of the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>D<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>. In this embodiment, each A can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, each B can be selected from the group of Ga, In, each C can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, Ga, In, each D can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, Ga, In, each O can be atomic oxygen, and each x can be independently a non-zero integer. That is, the value of “x” for each of the constituent elements may be different. Thus, in this embodiment, a four-component oxide can be formed that includes a zinc-cadmium-gallium-indium oxide. In this embodiment, the one or more compounds of the formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>D<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x </sub>can include an atomic composition of ratio A:B:C:D wherein A, B, C, and D, are each in a range of about 0.017 to about 0.95. Thus, the zinc-cadmium-gallium-indium oxide can include an atomic composition having a ratio, near ends of a range, of about 0.017 zinc, 0.017 cadmium, 0.017 gallium, and 0.95 indium or ratios of zinc/cadmium/gallium/indium in between the ratio near ends of the range. That is, the channel according to this embodiment can include a four-component oxide having atomic composition ratios with the relative concentration of each component falling within the range of about 0.017 to about 0.95.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As one of ordinary skill will understand, the atomic composition ratios of metal cations for any given two, three, and four component oxides are not limited to the ratios in the foregoing embodiments. In various embodiments, each of the two, three, and four component oxides can be formed having a variety of atomic composition ratios. For example, a three-component oxide can include an atomic composition having a ratio of 0.025 zinc, 0.485 gallium, and 0.49 indium.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the various embodiments, the multicomponent oxide can include various morphologies depending on composition, processing conditions, and other factors. The various morphological states can include amorphous states, and polycrystalline states. A polycrystalline state can include a single-phase crystalline state or a mixed-phase crystalline state. Additionally, in the various embodiments, the source, drain, and gate electrodes can include a substantially transparent material. By using substantially transparent materials for the source, drain, and gate electrodes, areas of the thin-film transistor can be transparent to the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. In the transistor arts, a person of ordinary skill will appreciate that devices such as active matrix liquid crystal displays having display elements (pixels) coupled to thin-film transistors (TFT's) having substantially transparent materials for selecting or addressing the pixel to be on or off will improve display performance by allowing more light to be transmitted through the display.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the channel <b>208</b> can be formed from a multicomponent oxide with a channel thickness of about 50 nm, however, in various embodiments the thickness of the channel can vary depending on a variety of factors including whether the channel material is amorphous or polycrystalline, and the device in which the channel is to be incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, the channel <b>208</b> is positioned adjacent the gate dielectric <b>206</b> and between the source and drain electrodes <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>. An applied voltage at the gate electrode <b>204</b> can facilitate electron accumulation or depletion in the channel <b>208</b>. In addition, the applied voltage can enhance electron injection from the source electrode <b>210</b> to the channel <b>208</b> and electron extraction therefrom by the drain electrode <b>212</b>. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the channel <b>208</b> can allow for on/off operation by controlling current flowing between the drain electrode <b>212</b> and the source electrode <b>210</b> using a voltage applied to the gate electrode <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In various embodiments, the channel <b>208</b> can include a multicomponent oxide material with at least one metal cation selected from group 12, and at least one metal cation selected from group 13, wherein group 12 metal cations can include Zn and Cd, and group 13 metal cations can include Ga and In, to form at least one of a three-component oxide, a four-component oxide, and a two-component oxide that includes zinc-gallium oxide, cadmium-gallium oxide, cadmium-indium oxide. Additionally, in the various embodiments, each component in the multicomponent oxide material is different. For example, where a multicomponent oxide includes three metal cations, i.e., a three-component oxide, the same two cations will not be included in the three-component oxide, thus, if zinc is included in the three-component oxide, it will not be included as a second or third component of the three-component oxide. In another example, if zinc is a component of a four-component oxide, the other three components of the four-component oxide will not include zinc. These atomic compositions do not take into consideration the optional presence of oxygen and other elements. They are merely a representation of the selection of cations for the multicomponent oxide material used for the channel of a thin-film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The multicomponent oxides, as described herein, can provide very satisfactory electrical performance, specifically in the area of channel mobility. As appreciated by one skilled in the art, mobility is a characteristic that can help in determining thin-film transistor performance, as maximum operating frequency, speed, and drive current increase in direct proportion to channel mobility. In addition, the channel can be transparent in both the visible and near-infrared spectrums, allowing for an entire thin-film transistor to be optically transparent throughout the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The use of the multicomponent oxide channel illustrated in the embodiments of the present disclosure is beneficial for a wide variety of thin-film applications in integrated circuit structures. For example, such applications include transistors, as discussed herein, such as thin-film transistors, horizontal, vertical, coplanar electrode, staggered electrode, top-gate, bottom-gate, single-gate, and double-gate, to name only a few. In the various embodiments, transistors (e.g., thin-film transistors) of the present disclosure can be provided as switches or amplifiers, where applied voltages to the gate electrodes of the transistors can affect a flow of electrons through the channel. As one of ordinary skill will appreciate, transistors can operate in a variety of ways. For example, when a transistor is used as a switch, the transistor can operate in the saturation region, and where a transistor is used as an amplifier, the transistor can operate in the linear region. In addition, the use of transistors incorporating channels of a multicomponent oxide in integrated circuits and structures incorporating integrated circuits such as visual display panels (e.g., active matrix LCD displays) such as that shown and described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> below. In display applications and other applications, it will often be desirable to fabricate one or more of the remaining thin-film transistor layers, e.g., source, drain, and gate electrodes, to be at least partially transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the source electrode <b>210</b> and the drain electrode <b>212</b> include an ITO layer having a thickness of about 200 nm. In the various embodiments however, the thickness can vary depending on a variety of factors including type of materials, applications, and other factors. In various embodiments, the source and drain electrodes <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, may include a transparent conductor, such as an n-type doped wide-bandgap semiconductor. Examples include, but are not limited to, n-type doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, indium-tin oxide (ITO), or ZnO, and the like. The source and drain electrodes <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> may also include a metal such as In, Sn, Ga, Zn, Al, Ti, Ag, Cu, Au, Pt, W, or Ni, and the like. In the various embodiments of the present disclosure, all of the electrodes <b>204</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> may include transparent materials such that the various embodiments of the transistors may be made substantially transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The various layers of the transistor structures described herein can be formed using a variety of techniques. For example, the gate dielectric <b>206</b> may be deposited by a low-pressure CVD process using Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>at about 430° C., and may be subsequently annealed in order to reduce leakage current characteristics. Thin-film deposition techniques such as evaporation (e.g., thermal, e-beam), physical vapor deposition (PVD) (e.g., dc reactive sputtering, rf magnetron sputtering, and ion beam sputtering), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and the like may be employed. Additionally, alternate methods may also be employed for depositing the various transistor layers of the embodiments of the present disclosure. Such alternate methods can include anodization (electrochemical oxidation) of a metal film, as well as deposition from a liquid precursor such as spin coating and ink-jet printing including thermal and piezoelectric drop-on-demand printing. Film patterning may employ photolithography combined with etching or lift-off processes, or may use alternate techniques such as shadow masking. Doping of one or more of the layers (e.g., the channel illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may also be accomplished by the introduction of oxygen vacancies and/or substitution of aliovalent elements.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments of the present disclosure also include methods of forming metal containing films on a surface of a substrate or substrate assembly, such as a silicon wafer, with or without layers or structures formed thereon, used in forming integrated circuits, and in particular thin-film transistors as described herein.

In other words, many of the precursor compounds listed below are provided as multicomponent metals, i.e., metal-metal compounds. The below described method is not intended to limit the compounds by excluding oxygen. As one of ordinary skill will understand, oxygen can be included in the precursor compounds in the various deposition techniques described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Various combinations of the precursor compounds described herein can be used in a precursor composition. Thus, as used herein, a “precursor composition” refers to a solid or liquid that includes one or more precursor compounds described herein optionally mixed with one or more precursor compounds other than those described herein. For example, zinc precursor compounds and gallium precursor compounds can be provided in one precursor composition or in separate compositions. Where they are included in separate compositions, both precursor compositions are included when a channel is deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In block <b>320</b>, a channel contacting the drain electrode and the source electrode, and including a multicomponent oxide, can be deposited. For example, the channel can be deposited between the drain electrode and a source electrode so as to electrically couple the two electrodes. In the various embodiments, depositing the channel contacting the drain electrode and the source electrode can include providing at least one precursor composition including one or more precursor compounds that include: zinc-gallium oxide, cadmium-gallium oxide, and cadmium-indium oxide can be provided. For example, zinc precursor compounds and cadmium precursor compounds can be provided in one precursor composition or in separate compositions. Thus, a precursor composition according to these embodiments can include binary metal oxides, i.e., zinc oxide, and other multicomponent metal oxides, i.e., zinc-gallium oxide. Where a precursor composition includes a binary metal oxide, an additional precursor composition including a different binary metal oxide can be included when depositing a channel, thereby forming a channel that includes a multicomponent metal oxide, such as a zinc-gallium oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, in various embodiments, the precursor composition can further include one or more precursor compounds that include A<sub>x</sub>, one or more precursor compounds that include B<sub>x</sub>, and one or more precursor compounds that include C<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In such embodiments, each A can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, each B can be selected from the group of Ga, In, each C can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, Ga, In, each x can be independently a non-zero integer, and each of A, B, and C are different. That is, the value of “x” for each of the constituent elements may be different. Thus, in these embodiments, at least one metal cation from a group defined by A, at least one metal cation from a group defined by B, and at least one metal cation from a group defined by C can be provided to form one or more precursor compositions of one or more compounds of A<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>x</sub>, and C<sub>x</sub>. For example, a precursor composition according to these embodiments can include precursor compounds of Ax, Bx, and Cx. Additionally, a precursor compound according to these embodiments can include compounds of Ax and Cx. In such a case, an additional precursor composition including Bx can be included when depositing a channel, thereby forming a channel that includes a quaternary metal oxide, i.e., a three-component oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the precursor composition can further include one or more precursor compounds that include D<sub>x</sub>. In this embodiment, each A, B, and C can include those materials as described herein, and each D can be selected from the group of Zn, Cd, Ga, In, each x can be independently a non-zero integer, and each of A, B, C, and D are different. That is, the value of “x” for each of the constituent elements may be different. Thus, in this embodiment, the precursor composition can include one or more compounds that include A<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>x</sub>, C<sub>x</sub>, and D<sub>x</sub>. In such an embodiment, at least one metal cation from groups defined by A, B, C, and D can be provided to form one or more precursor compositions of one or more compounds of A<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>x</sub>, C<sub>x</sub>, and D<sub>x</sub>. In this embodiment however, a deposited channel includes the precursor compounds of A<sub>x</sub>, B<sub>x</sub>, C<sub>x</sub>, and D<sub>x</sub>, thereby forming a channel that includes a four-component oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, “liquid” refers to a solution or a neat liquid (a liquid at room temperature or a solid at room temperature that melts at an elevated temperature). As used herein, a “solution” does not call for complete solubility of the solid; rather, the solution may have some undissolved material, more desireably, however, there is a sufficient amount of the material that can be carried by the organic solvent into the vapor phase for chemical vapor deposition processing. The precursor compounds as used herein can also include one or more organic solvents suitable for use in a chemical vapor deposition system, as well as other additives, such as free ligands, that assist in the vaporization of the desired precursor compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A wide variety of Zn, Cd, Ga, and In precursor compounds suitable for thin-film deposition techniques can be used with the embodiments of the present disclosure. Examples of the precursor compounds include, but are not limited to, the metals and oxides of the metals, including ZnO, ZnO<sub>2</sub>, CdO, GaO, Ga<sub>2</sub>O, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, InO, and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>precursor compounds. Although specific precursor compounds are illustrated herein, a wide variety of precursor compounds can be used as long as they can be used in a deposition process. In the various embodiments of the present disclosure, the Zn, Cd, Ga, and In precursor compounds can include neutral precursor compounds and may be liquids or solids at room temperature. If they are solids, they are sufficiently soluble in an organic solvent to allow for vaporization, they can be vaporized or sublimed, or ablated (e.g., by laser ablation or sputtering) from the solid state, or they have melting temperatures below their decomposition temperatures. Thus, many of the precursor compounds described herein are suitable for use in vapor deposition techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, (e.g., flash vaporization techniques, bubbler techniques, and/or microdroplet techniques).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The precursor compounds described herein can be used in precursor compositions for ink-jet deposition, sputtering, and vapor deposition techniques (e.g., chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD)). Alternatively, certain precursor compounds described herein can be used in precursor compositions for other deposition techniques, such as spin-on coating, and the like. Typically, those precursor compounds containing organic R groups with a low number of carbon atoms (e.g., 1-4 carbon atoms per R group) are suitable for use with vapor deposition techniques. Those precursor compounds containing organic R groups with a higher number of carbon atoms (e.g., 5-12 carbon atoms per R group) are generally suitable for spin-on or dip coating.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term “organic R groups” means a hydrocarbon group (with optional elements other than carbon and hydrogen, such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and silicon) that is classified as an aliphatic group, cyclic group, or combination of aliphatic and cyclic groups (e.g., alkaryl and aralkyl groups). In the context of the present disclosure, the organic groups are those that do not interfere with the formation of a metal-containing film. They may be of a type and size that do not interfere with the formation of a metal-containing film using chemical vapor deposition techniques. The term “aliphatic group” means a saturated or unsaturated linear or branched hydrocarbon group. This term is used to encompass alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups, for example. The term “alkyl group” means a saturated linear or branched hydrocarbon group including, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, heptyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, amyl, 2-ethylhexyl, and the like. The term “alkenyl group” means an unsaturated, linear or branched hydrocarbon group with one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, such as a vinyl group. The term “alkynyl group” means an unsaturated, linear or branched hydrocarbon group with one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. The term “cyclic group” means a closed ring hydrocarbon group that is classified as an alicyclic group, aromatic group, or heterocyclic group. The term “alicyclic group” means a cyclic hydrocarbon group having properties resembling those of aliphatic groups. The term “aromatic group” or “aryl group” means a mono- or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon group. The term “heterocyclic group” means a closed ring hydrocarbon in which one or more of the atoms in the ring is an element other than carbon (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the channel can be deposited including the precursor composition to form a multicomponent oxide from the precursor composition to electrically couple a drain electrode and a source electrode. In various embodiments, the channel can employ various physical vapor deposition techniques, such as dc reactive sputtering, rf sputtering, magnetron sputtering, and ion beam sputtering. Other methods for depositing the channel can include using an ink-jet deposition technique when the precursor composition includes a liquid form.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the various embodiments, the multicomponent oxide included in the channel can have a uniform composition throughout its thickness, although this is not a requisite. For example, in a four-component oxide, a precursor composition including a precursor compound that includes A<sub>x </sub>can be deposited first and then a combination of precursor compounds that include B<sub>x</sub>, C<sub>x</sub>, and D<sub>x </sub>can be deposited to form a four-component oxide channel. As will be appreciated, the thickness of the multicomponent oxide channel will be dependent upon the application for which it is used. For example, the thickness can have a range of about 1 nanometer to about 1,000 nanometers. In an alternative embodiment, the thickness can have a range of about 10 nanometers to about 200 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the multicomponent oxide can include compounds of at least one metal cation from group 12, and at least one metal cation from group 13, wherein the group 12 cation includes Zn and Cd cations, and the group 13 cation includes Ga and In cations to form at least one of a three-component oxide, a four-component oxide, and a two-component oxide that includes zinc-gallium oxide, cadmium-gallium oxide, cadmium-indium oxide. The precursor compounds for group 12 and group 13 metal cations are typically mononuclear (i.e., monomers in that they contain one metal per molecule), although weakly bound dimers (i.e., dimers containing two monomers weakly bonded together through hydrogen or dative bonds) are also possible. In additional embodiments of the present disclosure, the precursor compounds used for forming the multicomponent oxide can include organometallic compounds suitable for vapor deposition. Example of such organometallic compounds include, but are not limited to, zinc acethylacetonate [Zn(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] and indium acethylacetonate [In(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>].</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As discussed herein, the precursor compounds used for forming the multicomponent oxide in a sputtering process in the embodiments of the present disclosure can include two, three, and four-component oxides. For example, a two-component oxide can be used as a target to form the channel. The two-component oxide can be deposited in a thin-film by sputtering by use of the above-mentioned target and a single-phase crystalline state for the channel can be obtained. For illustration, a single-phase crystalline state can include compounds from group 12, and compounds from group 13, wherein group 12 includes an oxide of the metal cation Zn, such as ZnO, and group 13 includes an oxide of the metal cation Ga, such as Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, of the formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Zn<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2y</sub>O<sub>x+3y </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In this embodiment, the values of x and y can be found in given ranges. For example, x and y can each independently be found in a range of about 1 to about 15, a range of about 2 to about 10, integer values greater than 1, and integer values less than 15. Specific examples of the value of x and y include 2 and 1, respectively, where the single-phase crystalline state of the zinc-gallium oxide includes Zn<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively, embodiments of the zinc-gallium oxide can exhibit a mixed-phase crystalline state resulting from sputtering by use of the above-mentioned target. For example, the mixed-phase crystalline state can include, but is not limited to, two or more phases that can include, for example, ZnO, Zn<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>with a range of phase-to-phase ratio A:B:C (e.g., ZnO:Zn<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>: Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), where A, B, and C, are each in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.99.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, the compounds of the group 12 and group 13 cations can exhibit excellent electron transport in the amorphous state. As such, a desireable level of performance can be achieved without crystallization of the multicomponent oxide. Thus, in various embodiments, the zinc-gallium oxide can have a substantially amorphous form. For example, the zinc-gallium oxide can include an atomic composition of zinc(x):gallium (1-x), where x is in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.99. This atomic composition does not take into consideration the optional presence of oxygen and other elements. It is merely a representation of the relative ratio of zinc and gallium. In an additional embodiment, x can be in the range of about 0.1 to about 0.9, and in the range of about 0.05 to about 0.95.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As one of ordinary skill will appreciate, in embodiments where three and four-component oxides are used for channel formation by sputtering and other deposition techniques, the atomic compositions for each precursor compound can include a range of about 0.01 to about 0.99. Additionally, other ranges can include a range of about 0.1 to about 0.9, and a range of about 0.05 to about 0.095.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, since each of these multicomponent oxide materials is based on combination of groups 12 and 13 cations, a substantial degree of qualitative similarity is expected in structural and electrical properties, and in processing considerations. Furthermore, zinc-indium oxide, a constituent of the two-component oxides disclosed herein has been shown to exhibit excellent electron transport and thus, qualitatively similar performance from the remaining two-component oxide combinations including the three, and four-component oxides can be expected. An example of the electron transport characteristics of the zinc-indium oxide can be found in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/799,961 entitled “SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE” filed on Mar. 12, 2004.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Sputtering or chemical vapor deposition processes can be carried out in an atmosphere of inert gas and/or a reaction gas to form a relatively pure multicomponent oxide channel. The inert gas is typically selected from the group including nitrogen, helium, argon, and mixtures thereof. In the context of the present disclosure, the inert gas is one that is generally unreactive with the precursor compounds described herein and does not interfere with the formation of a multicomponent oxide channel.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The reaction gas can be selected from a wide variety of gases reactive with the precursor compounds described herein, at least at a surface under the conditions of deposition. Examples of reaction gases include hydrogen and oxidizing gases such as O<sub>2</sub>. Various combinations of carrier gases and/or reaction gases can be used in the embodiments of the present disclosure to form the multicomponent oxide channel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, in a sputtering process for the multicomponent oxide channel, the process may be performed by using a mixture of argon and oxygen as the sputtering gas at a particular flow rate, with the application of an RF power for achieving the desired deposition in a sputter deposition chamber. However, it should be readily apparent that any manner of forming the multicomponent oxide channel is contemplated in accordance with the present disclosure and is in no manner limited to any particular process, e.g., sputtering, for formation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In block <b>330</b>, both a gate electrode and a gate dielectric positioned between the gate electrode and the channel can be provided in forming an embodiment of the thin-film transistor of the present disclosure.</p>
