<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a mobile communication system, and more particularly to an apparatus and method for transmitting and receiving error check information of control information to maintain uniform reception of control information transmitted from a terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typical mobile communication systems may be divided into two types according to their applications. The first type supports a voice service and the second type supports a data service. A typical mobile communication system is a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system. One of the currently used CDMA system, which supports only a voice service, complies with the International Standard (IS)-95 and the IS-95 based specifications. As the communication technology has developed along with users' demands, the mobile communication system has gradually evolved to the point where it supports a high rate data service. For example, a 1st generation CDMA 2000 (CDMA 2000 1×) system was designed to simultaneously support both the voice and audio services, whereas a 1×Evolution in Data Only (EVDO) system was designed to support only the high rate data service by allocating to the data service all resources achievable by the CDMA 2000 1× system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mobile communication system generally performs transmission in two directions: forward and reverse. The forward direction is from a base station, which covers a predetermined area (referred to as a “cell”), to a mobile terminal capable of moving between cells. The reverse direction is from the mobile terminal to the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the reverse transmission of user data in the mobile communication system as described above, the user data is transmitted at a rate of 0 kbps (i.e. no data to be transmitted), 9.6 kbps, 19.2 kbps, 38.4 kbps, 76.8 kbps or 153.6 kbps over a Reverse Traffic Channel (R-TRCH). The base station controls only the maximum allowable data rate of the R-TRCH, while the mobile terminal selects the actual data rate to use from among data rates that are less than the maximum allowable data rate. A Reverse Rate Indicator (RRI), which indicates a reverse data rate to be used by the mobile terminal, is reported to the base station over a Reverse Rate Indicator Channel (R-RICH).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary structure of the R-RICH. As shown, an RRI of the R-RICH <b>110</b> is transmitted in the same time interval (or duration) as data traffic of a corresponding traffic channel <b>120</b> at time intervals of 26.67 ms. If a frame is defined as a data unit transmitted in each time interval, an RRI for a traffic channel carrying an i-th frame is transmitted in an i-th time interval. The RRI is composed of 3 bits, and the RRI's values are mapped to data rates as shown in the following table.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to receive the i-th frame of the traffic channel, the base station first receives control information, which is transmitted over the R-RICH in the same time interval as the i-th frame (i.e. in the i-th time interval), and then performs channel decoding and de-spreading for the traffic channel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a R-RICH transmitter for transmitting R-RICH signals from a mobile terminal in a mobile communication system. A Reverse Rate Indicator (RRI) symbol, composed of 3 bits, is transmitted at intervals of 16 slots.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a simplex encoder <b>210</b> encodes 3-bit RRI symbols to output coded symbols. A codeword repeater <b>220</b> repeats the coded symbols in a predetermined repeated pattern (for example, a predetermined number of times). A puncturer <b>230</b> punctures the last <b>3</b> symbols of the repeated symbols from the repeater <b>220</b>. A Time Division Multiplexer (TDM) <b>240</b> multiplexes the output of the puncturer <b>230</b> and a pilot-channel input sequence of all “0” symbols and outputs 128 binary symbols every slot. A signal point mapper <b>250</b> performs +1/−1 mapping (i.e., 0/1 →+1/−1) on the symbols output from the multiplexer <b>204</b>. A Walsh spreader <b>260</b> spreads the output of the signal point mapper <b>250</b> by multiplying the output by predetermined Walsh codes for transmission over the R-RICH.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The R-RICH as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and a traffic channel relating thereto receive the R-RICH signal transmitted by the transmitter as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, but can only decode the traffic channel signal only if there is no error in decoding the received R-RICH signal. If there is a decoding error of the R-RICH, the base station receiver cannot detect the actual data rate of the traffic channel, making error-free decoding difficult. Thus, it is very important for the 1×EVDO system to perform suitable power control to achieve a sufficiently-low reception error probability of the R-RICH since the reception performance of traffic signals is affected by the reception performance of the R-RICH signals.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Two types of power control are performed in the mobile communication system. The first type is inner loop power control, in which transmission power is controlled to allow the bit energy per noise ratio (Eb/Nt) of the R-RICH to approach a predetermined target setpoint. The second is outer loop power control, in which if an error has occurred in the received data, the target setpoint is increased; otherwise, the target setpoint is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, the base station cannot determine whether there is an error in the decoded data received over the R-RICH, since additional information needed for determining whether there is an error in the decoded result is not transmitted from the mobile terminal over the R-RICH, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, the mobile terminal must allocate sufficiently-high transmission power to the R-RICH, so that in any wireless environment the base station can receive the R-RICH signal with an error probability at a level lower than a predetermined limit value. However, such an increase in power increases interference with other channels.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the following description, a channel used to transmit the control information of a traffic channel signal transmitted by a mobile terminal will be referred to as a control channel of the traffic channel. The control channel signal may include information relating to a Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ), in addition to information relating to the data rate of the reverse traffic channel. In the HARQ technology, if a negative acknowledgement (NAK) is received in response to a transmitted data frame, the same data is retransmitted, but if an acknowledgement (ACK) is received, the next data is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a mobile communication system, in order for a base station to maintain uniform error probability of a control channel signal transmitted by a mobile terminal through the outer loop power control, it is required to determine whether an error occurs in the decoded result of the control channel. The simplest way to determine whether an error occurs in the control channel is to transmit a Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) corresponding to the control information each time the mobile terminal transmits the control information over a time interval during which the control channel signal is transmitted. This process allows the base station to determine, based on the CRC, whether there is an error in the control information, each time the base station receives the control information, and then allows the base station to perform the outer loop power control based on the determined result.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, the control information is generally a very small amount of information, whereas the CRC is composed of 6, 8 or 16 bits, which is relatively large, compared to the control information. If the control information and the relatively-large CRC are transmitted together, higher transmission power is required to transmit the CRC even though almost the same performance is achieved as when only the control information is transmitted. However, as the transmission power increases, interference caused by the increased power of the control channel also increases. For example, when a 6-bit CRC is added to transmit an 8-bit control information, interference caused by the control channel increases by 75%, compared to when no CRC is added.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A description will now be given of several embodiments according to the present invention, whereby interference caused by the transmission of control information over the control channel increases by only a relatively small amount even when the control information is transmitted after adding a CRC thereto. In the following, a separate description will be given for each embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">1. First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating the transmission of control information and a CRC from a mobile terminal according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in this figure, the mobile terminal transmits the control information with the CRC added thereto in a predetermined time interval or intervals of the control channel as denoted by reference numeral “<b>320</b>”, whereas it transmits only the control information during the remaining time intervals as denoted by reference numeral “<b>310</b>”. The predetermined time interval during which the CRC is added to the control information is prescribed between the base station and the mobile terminal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> does not show a traffic channel signal transmitted together with the control channel signal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mobile terminal transmits control information with a CRC added thereto in every 4th frame. In other words, the mobile terminal transmits the control information with the CRC added thereto only in i+1th and i+5th frames, whereas it transmits only the control information in the remaining frames (i.e., ith, i+2th, i+4th, i+6th, i+7th, and i+8th frames).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The base station performs a decoding operation, as a counterpart operation to the encoding operation at the transmitter, for control channel signals received in the i+1th and i+5th frames prescribed between the base station and the mobile terminal, so as to obtain control information and a CRC. After obtaining the control information and the CRC, the base station checks the CRC to determine whether there is an error in the decoded control information. If it is determined from the CRC check that an error has occurred, a power control target setpoint is increased through the outer loop power control; otherwise, the power control target setpoint is decreased through the outer loop power control.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The base station performs a decoding operation, as a counterpart operation to the encoding operation at the transmitter, for control channel signals received in the remaining frames, other than the i+1th and i+5th frames, so as to obtain control information. Since no CRC is additionally transmitted in the remaining frames, no outer loop power control is performed during the time interval corresponding to the remaining frames.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a control channel transmitter for transmitting control channel signals from a mobile terminal according to the first embodiment of the present invention. A control information generator (not shown) generates the control information. Here, it is assumed that control information transmitted over the control channel consists of 8 bits. The 8-bit control information includes for example various types of information relating to the HARQ and the data rate of a traffic channel in a 1×EVDO system. The 8-bit control information is transmitted using elements <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> and <b>450</b>, or using elements <b>460</b>, <b>470</b> and <b>480</b>, depending on whether the control information is transmitted together with the CRC.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, during the time interval defined for transmitting the control information with the CRC added thereto, a CRC generator <b>410</b> adds a CRC of a predetermined number of bits (for example, a 6-bit CRC) to the 8-bit control information, and outputs 14 bits corresponding to the combination of the 8-bit control information and the 6-bit CRC. A tail bit generator <b>420</b> adds an 8-bit encoder tail for convolutionally encoding to the 14-bit output of the CRC generator <b>410</b>. A convolutional encoder <b>430</b> convolutionally encodes the 22-bit output of the tail bit generator <b>420</b> at a predetermined code rate (e.g., R=¼). The output of the convolutional encoder <b>430</b> is repeated and punctured by a repeater and puncturer <b>440</b>, after which the output is orthogonally spread (for example, with orthogonal codes) by a Walsh spreader <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a block encoder <b>460</b> block-encodes the 8-bit control information at a predetermined code rate (n, 8) during a time interval defined for transmitting only the control information. An output of the block encoder <b>460</b> is repeated and punctured by a repeater and puncturer <b>470</b>, after which the output is orthogonally spread by a Walsh spreader <b>480</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A controller <b>490</b> controls the operations of the above elements, and particularly determines whether to additionally transmit the CRC each time the control information is transmitted. The controller <b>490</b> enables the five elements <b>410</b> to <b>450</b> during a time interval in which the CRC is to be additionally transmitted, and enables the three elements <b>460</b> to <b>480</b> during the remaining time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, it should be noted that different encoding schemes are required depending on whether the CRC is added. That is, if the control information is transmitted after the CRC is added thereto, the total bits to be transmitted is 14 bits, including the 8 bits of the control information and the 6 bits of the CRC. Accordingly, the convolutional encoder <b>430</b> having the code rate of ¼ is used in this case. On the other hand, the convolutional encoder <b>460</b> having the code rate (n, 8) is used in the case where only the 8 bit control information is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a control channel receiver as a counterpart element to the control channel transmitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The control information is received through three elements <b>520</b> to <b>540</b> (i.e., a combiner <b>520</b>, a Viterbi decoder <b>530</b> and a CRC checker <b>540</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, during the time interval in which the mobile terminal transmits the control information with the CRC added thereto. The control information is received through two elements <b>550</b> and <b>560</b> (i.e., a combiner <b>550</b> and a block decoder <b>560</b>) during the remaining time intervals in which only the control information (without the CRC) is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the case where the mobile terminal has transmitted the control information with the CRC added thereto over the control channel, the Walsh despreader <b>510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> orthogonally despreads a control channel signal received from the mobile terminal, and the combiner <b>520</b> combines outputs of the Walsh despreader <b>510</b> during a predetermined time. The combining operation of the combiner <b>520</b> is a counterpart operation to the repeating and puncturing operation of the repeater and puncturer <b>440</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, the combiner <b>520</b> recombines symbols repeated by the repeater and puncturer <b>440</b>. The Viterbi decoder <b>530</b> decodes an output of the combiner <b>520</b> in a manner corresponding to the code rate (R=¼) of the convolutional encoder <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and then outputs control information and a CRC. Then, the CRC checker <b>540</b> checks the CRC to determine whether there is an error in the control information. The target setpoint controller <b>580</b> controls a power control target setpoint according to the determined result by the CRC checker <b>540</b>. That is, the target setpoint controller <b>580</b> increases a target setpoint for the outer loop power control if an error occurs in the control information; otherwise the target setpoint controller <b>580</b> decreases the target setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the case where the mobile terminal has transmitted only the control information over the control channel, the combiner <b>550</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> combines outputs of the Walsh despreader <b>510</b> during a predetermined time. The combining operation of the combiner <b>550</b> is a counterpart operation to the repeating and puncturing operation of the repeater/puncturer <b>470</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The block decoder <b>560</b> decodes an output of the combiner <b>550</b> in a manner corresponding to the code rate (n, 8) of the block encoder <b>460</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and then outputs control information.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A controller <b>570</b> controls the operations of the above elements, and particularly determines whether there is a CRC added to the control information for each time the control information is received. Here, the time interval in which the control information with the CRC added thereto is transmitted must be prescribed between the mobile terminal and the base station. Based on the periodically received CRCs, the controller <b>570</b> can determine whether an error has occurred in the control information, and then perform suitable outer loop power control according to the determined result.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Based on the determination as to whether there is a CRC added to the control information, the controller <b>570</b> enables the elements <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b> and <b>580</b> during the time interval in which the CRC is received, and enables the elements <b>510</b>, <b>550</b> and <b>560</b> during the remaining time interval. The control information obtained by the receiver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is used for the base station to obtain information relating to a corresponding HARQ and data rate when it receives a reverse traffic channel signal.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart showing a method for transmitting control information and a CRC from a mobile terminal according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the mobile terminal selects, at step <b>610</b>, control information to be carried by a control channel, and then determines, at step <b>620</b>, whether the current time interval is the time interval in which error detection information is to be transmitted. If the determination at step <b>620</b> is negative, the mobile terminal enables the elements <b>460</b>, <b>470</b> and <b>480</b> to block-encode the control information at step <b>630</b> and transmit the encoded control information at step <b>640</b>. On the other hand, if the determination at step <b>620</b> is positive (i.e., if the current time interval is the time interval in which error detection information is to be transmitted), the mobile terminal generates a CRC for at least one predetermined and recently received control information, at step <b>650</b>. Then, the mobile terminal enables the elements <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>440</b> and <b>450</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to convolutionally encode the generated CRC and the control information of the current time interval at step <b>660</b>, and then transmit the convolutionally encoded control information and CRC over the control channel at step <b>670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart showing a method for receiving control information and a CRC by the base station according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at step <b>710</b>, the base station receives a control channel signal. Then, at step <b>720</b>, the base station determines whether the current time interval is the time interval in which it receives error detection information. In order to make this determination, the base station must share a rule used for the mobile terminal to determine, at said step <b>620</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, during what time interval the error detection information is to be transmitted. The determination as to during what time interval the error detection information is transmitted must be based on a common rule prescribed between the base station and the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the determination at step <b>720</b> is negative (i.e., if the current time interval is the time interval in which no error detection information is received), at step <b>730</b>, the base station enables only the elements <b>550</b> and <b>560</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and decodes a signal received over the control channel to obtain control information. Then, at step <b>740</b>, the base station maintains the target setpoint for the outer loop power control at the same level as the previous time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the other hand, if the determination at step <b>720</b> is positive (i.e., if the current time interval is the time interval in which error detection information is received), at step <b>750</b>, the base station enables the elements <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> and <b>540</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and decodes a signal received over the control channel to obtain control information of the current time interval and a CRC for the at least one recent control information. Then, at step <b>760</b>, the base station checks the obtained CRC to determine, at step <b>770</b>, whether there is an error in the at least one recent control information.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If the determination at step <b>770</b> (based on the CRC check result) is that there is no error in the at least one recent control information (i.e., if the CRC check result is “CRC OK”), at step <b>780</b>, the base station decreases the target setpoint for the outer loop power control by a predetermined level, relative to the previous time interval. On the other hand, if the determination at step <b>770</b> is that there is an error in said at least one recent control information (i.e., if the CRC check result is “CRC FAIL”), at step <b>790</b>, the base station increases the target setpoint for the outer loop power control by a predetermined level, relative to the previous time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The above description has been given with reference to the case where 8-bit control information with a 6-bit CRC added thereto is transmitted. However, in the case where the number of bits of the control information is less than that of the CRC, it is impossible to create a normal CRC. When this occurs, the CRC generator <b>410</b> accumulates and receives at least two predetermined recently received control information, and generates a CRC for the at least two accumulated control information, and then outputs the generated CRC, together with the current control information. In this case, the CRC added by the CRC generator <b>410</b> is error detection information not just for the current control information but for at least one additional control information that was previously transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">2. Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention may include a second embodiment, as a modification of the first embodiment, in which a CRC is generated for either one frame or a plurality of frames, and the CRC is divided and transmitted in a plurality of frames. In other words, in the second embodiment, the mobile terminal generates a CRC for control information transmitted in one frame or a plurality of frames, and then transmits the CRC together with the control information in a plurality of frames while a plurality of divided parts of the CRC is being transmitted respectively in said plurality of frames.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the transmission of control information and a CRC from a mobile terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> that a CRC generated for control information is divided and transmitted over the respective control channels of a plurality of frames as described above. That is, the generated CRC is divided and transmitted in a plurality of frames.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an 8-bit CRC generated for one frame or a plurality of frames is equally divided into four 2-bit CRC parts, which are transmitted from the mobile terminal in four frames (i.e., ith, i+1th, i+2th, i+3th frames). As an example where a CRC is generated for control information transmitted in one frame, an 8-bit CRC generated for control information transmitted in the ith frame is transmitted 2 bits by 2 bits in the ith, i+1th, i+2th, i+3th frames. As an example where a CRC is generated for control information transmitted in a plurality of frames, an 8-bit CRC generated for control information transmitted in i−3th, i−2th, i−1th and ith frames is transmitted 2 bits by 2 bits, in ith, i+1th, i+2th and i+3th frames.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a control channel transmitter for transmitting control channel signals from a mobile terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the control channel transmitter in the case where the control information is transmitted over a control channel and is composed of 8 bits, and an 8-bit CRC is transmitted in every 4 frames. In this case, 8-bit control information generated per frame is stored in a control information storage unit <b>910</b> after it is generated. The reason why the control information is stored in the control information storage unit <b>910</b> is to use control information transmitted in a plurality of frames when generating the CRC. If a CRC is generated for error detection of single control information, the control information storage unit <b>910</b> stores only the single control information. On the other hand, if a CRC is generated for error detection of a plurality of control information, the control information storage unit <b>910</b> stores the plurality of control information.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Once in every 4 frames, a CRC generator <b>950</b> generates an 8-bit CRC using control information generated in the most recent 4 frames. The generated 8-bit CRC is inputted to the CRC storage unit <b>960</b> and stored therein until the next CRC is generated. The 8 bit CRC is divided into four 2 bit CRC parts and two bits of the 8 bit CRC is input to an encoder <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In more detail, the encoder <b>920</b> receives both 8-bit control information and 2 CRC bits to be transmitted in every frame, and encodes the received control information and the 2 CRC bits, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. That is, at each time interval 8 bits of control information generated in the corresponding frame and 2 bits of the 8 CRC bits generated in the previous frames are inputted to the encoder <b>920</b>. We now consider an example where a CRC is generated using control information of the i−3th, i−2th, i−1th and ith frames, and the CRC is divided and transmitted in the ith, i+1th, i+2th and i+3th frames. In this case, the following process occurs: the 8-bit control information and 1st and 2nd bits of the 8 CRC bits are encoded and transmitted in the ith frame; 8-bit control information and 3rd and 4th bits of the 8 CRC bits are encoded and transmitted in the i+1th frame; 8-bit control information and 5th and 6th bits of the 8 CRC bits are encoded and transmitted in the i+2th frame; and 8-bit control information and 7th and 8th bits of the 8 CRC bits are encoded and transmitted in the i+3th frame.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An output signal from the encoder <b>920</b> is repeated and punctured by a repeater and puncturer <b>930</b>, and then transmitted after being orthogonally spread by a Walsh spreader <b>940</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">First, a Walsh despreader <b>1010</b> orthogonally despreads a signal received over the control channel, and then a combiner <b>1020</b> combines output signals from the Walsh despreader <b>1010</b>. The combining operation of the combiner <b>1020</b> is a counterpart operation to the repeating and puncturing operation of the repeater and puncturer <b>930</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Thus, the combiner <b>1020</b> recombines the bits repeated by the repeater and puncturer <b>930</b>. A block decoder <b>1030</b> receives and decodes an output signal from the combiner <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As a result of the decoding operation, the block decoder <b>1030</b> obtains 8-bit control information and a 2 bit part of the CRC. A control information storage unit <b>1080</b> and a CRC storage unit <b>1040</b> receive and store the 8-bit control information and the 2 bit part of the CRC, respectively. The reason for providing the storage units <b>1040</b> and <b>1080</b> is to store the received CRC bits (2 bits received in every frame) until all 8 bits of the CRC are received and stored, so as to perform the CRC check. For example, if an 8-bit CRC has been divided and transmitted 2 bits by 2 bits over the respective control channels of the ith, i+1th, i+2th and i+3th frames, there is a need for the base station receiver to accumulate the 8 CRC bits, which are received 2 bits by 2 bits in the ith, i+1th, i+2th and i+3th frames, in order to perform the CRC check. In order to perform the CRC check, there is also a need for the receiver to store the control information used in generating the 8-bit CRC. For example, if an 8-bit CRC has been divided and transmitted 2 bits by 2 bits over the respective control channels of the ith, i+1th, i+2th and i+3th frames, and the 8-bit CRC has been generated for control information transmitted in the ith frame, then in order to perform the CRC check after receiving the i+3th frame, there is a need for the base station to maintain the control information transmitted in the ith frame until all 8 bits if the CRC is received. On the other hand, if an 8-bit CRC has been divided and transmitted 2 bits by 2 bits over the respective control channels of the ith, i+1th, i+2th and i+3th frames (i.e., a 2-bit CRC part being transmitted in each of the four frames), and the 8-bit CRC has been generated for control information transmitted in the i−3th, i−2th, i−1th and ith frames, then in order to perform the CRC check after receiving the i+3th frame, the base station must store the control information transmitted in the i−3th, i−2th, i−1th and ith frames until all of the CRC bits are received.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When all 8 CRC bits have been received, the base station receiver in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> performs the corresponding CRC check at a CRC checker <b>1050</b>. The CRC check result by the CRC checker <b>1050</b> is input to a target setpoint controller <b>1060</b>, and used to control a target setpoint for the outer loop power control.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The controller <b>1070</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> controls the CRC storage, CRC check and control information storage operations, performed respectively by the above elements <b>1040</b>, <b>1050</b> and <b>1080</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, even in the case where outer loop power control is performed based on a CRC generated for control information transmitted in a plurality of frames, it is possible to achieve uniform reception error probability through the outer loop power control, as in the case where the outer loop power control is performed based on a CRC generated for control information transmitted in one frame. One difference between the first and second embodiment is as follows. When a CRC is generated for control information transmitted in a single frame, a CRC check result “CRC pass” or “CRC fail”, obtained by performing the CRC check, indicates whether an error has occurred in the single frame. However, when a CRC is generated for control information transmitted in a plurality of frames, the CRC check result indicates whether an error has occurred in at least one of the plurality frames. In this case, in order to achieve the same reception error probability, the target error probability of the outer loop power control must be adjusted depending on the number of frames (i.e., the number of said plurality of frames) used to transmit control information for which a CRC has been generated.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The following is an example of such a method for adjusting the target error probability of the outer loop power control depending on the number of frames used to transmit control information for which a CRC has been generated. If a CRC has been generated using control information transmitted in N frames, and a desired reception error probability is T<sub>FER</sub>, the target error probability (Outer_PC_Error_Rate) of the outer loop power control is given by Equation 1.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Outer_PC_Error_Rate=1−(1<i>−T</i><sub>FER</sub>)<sup>N</sup>  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">After a target error probability of the outer loop power control is set as expressed in this equation, the CRC check is performed. If the CRC check result indicates that an error has occurred, the target setpoint for the outer loop power control is increased by xdB; otherwise, the target set point is decreased by x÷(1÷Outer_PC_Error_Rate_Rate−1)dB, thereby converging the reception error probability to T<sub>FER</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart showing a method for transmitting control information and a CRC from a mobile terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the mobile terminal selects, at step <b>1110</b>, control information to be carried by a control channel. Thereafter, at step <b>1120</b>, the mobile terminal stores the selected control information. The purpose of storing the control information at this step is to deal with the case where a CRC is generated using control information transmitted in a plurality of frames. In order to generate a CRC for control information to be transmitted in a plurality of frames, the control information must be stored until an actual CRC to be transmitted is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">After the control information has been stored at the above step <b>1120</b>, the mobile terminal determines, at step <b>1130</b>, whether the current frame corresponds to a time to generate a CRC. If the determination at step <b>1130</b> is positive, a CRC is generated at step <b>1160</b>. The CRC generated at this step is stored at step <b>1170</b>. Then, at step <b>1180</b>, the generated CRC is divided into a predetermined number of parts, and a part of the divided CRC is encoded together with control information of a corresponding frame. The encoded CRC and control information is transmitted over the control channel at step <b>1190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the determination at the above step <b>1130</b> is negative (i.e., if the current frame does not correspond to a time to generate a CRC), the mobile terminal encodes a part of the CRC, which has been stored after being generated in a prior frame, together with control information in the same manner as in the above step <b>1140</b>. The encoded CRC and control information is transmitted over the control channel at step <b>1150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">That part of the CRC, which is encoded together with the control information at step <b>1140</b> or <b>1180</b>, is a part of the generated CRC. For example, in the case where an 8-bit CRC is generated and then divided and transmitted in four frames, 2 bits of the 8-bit CRC are encoded, together with the control information, to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow chart showing a method for receiving control information and a CRC by a base station according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, at step <b>1210</b>, the base station receives a control channel signal transmitted from a mobile terminal.

Then, at step <b>1230</b>, the base station (or the base station receiver) determines whether the CRC, divided and transmitted in a plurality of frames, has been completely received. For example, where the CRC is divided into 4 parts and transmitted over the four frames (i.e., the ith, i+1th, i+2th and i+3th frames) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the base station receiver determines if the i+3th frame has been completely received.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If the determination at step <b>1230</b> is negative (i.e., if the CRC, divided and transmitted in the plurality of frames, has not been completely received), the base station stores, at step <b>1280</b>, control information and the received part of the CRC, received in the current frame, in a storage unit. After all parts of the CRC, divided and transmitted in the plurality frames, have been received, each of the received parts of the CRC is contained to recover the CRC. The recovered CRC is then used to perform a CRC check to determine whether an error has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">If the determination at step <b>1230</b> is positive (i.e., if the CRC, divided and transmitted in the plurality of frames, has been completely received), the base station performs, at step <b>1240</b>, the CRC check to determine whether there is an error, based both on the control information and part of the CRC received in the current frame, and on the control information and parts of the CRC, which have been received and stored in the previous frames.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">If the CRC check result at step <b>1250</b> is “CRC pass” indicating that no error is detected, the base station receiver decreases the target setpoint for the outer loop power control at step <b>1270</b>.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram illustrating the transmission of control information and a CRC from a mobile terminal according to a third embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the mobile terminal transmits control information in every frame over a control channel, whereas it transmits a CRC for the control information in every predetermined period of frames over an additional error detection channel. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the control information is transmitted in every frame over a control channel, whereas a CRC is transmitted in every four frames over an error detection channel. In this example, the control channel carries only the 8-bit control information, i.e., does not carry the CRC. Accordingly, the same amount of data is transmitted in all frames of the control channel, and thus the same encoding scheme is applied to all the frames. As a separate channel from the control channel, the error detection channel is used to transmit a CRC for the control information, transmitted in the same time interval, from the mobile terminal to the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mobile terminal transmits the CRC and the control information, both being encoded together, in a time interval during which the CRC is transmitted. In the embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the mobile terminal transmits the CRC and the control information, both being separately encoded, in the time interval during which the CRC is transmitted. In other words, in each of the i+1th and i+5th frames, the control information and the CRC are respectively transmitted over the control channel and the error detection channels, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, whereas in each of the remaining frames, only the control information is transmitted over the control channel without using the error detection channel.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">This embodiment has been described with reference to the case where each of the i+1th and i+5th frames is used to transmit a CRC for control information transmitted in the same time interval. However, according to a fourth embodiment, each of the i+1th and i+5th frames may be used to transmit a CRC for a plurality of control information transmitted in a plurality of frames. For example, a CRC for control information transmitted during the i−2th, i−1th, ith and i+1th frames is transmitted in the i+1th frame over the error detection channel, whereas a CRC for control information transmitted during the i+2th, i+3th, i+4th and i+5th frames is transmitted in the i+5th frame over the error detection channel.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of a control channel and error detection channel transmitter for transmitting a control channel signal and an error detection channel signal from a mobile terminal according to the third embodiment of the present invention. Here, it is assumed that control information transmitted over the control channel is composed of 8 bits. The 8-bit control information includes, for example, various types of information relating to the HARQ and the data rate of a traffic channel in a 1×EVDO system. Elements <b>1410</b>, <b>1420</b> and <b>1430</b> (i.e., a block encoder <b>1410</b>, a repeater/puncturer <b>1420</b> and a Walsh spreader <b>1430</b>) are used to transmit the 8-bit control information. A 6-bit CRC generated for at least one predetermined recent control information is transmitted over an error detection channel. Elements <b>1440</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1460</b> and <b>1470</b> (i.e., a CRC generator <b>1440</b>, a block encoder <b>1450</b>, a repeater/puncturer <b>1460</b> and a Walsh spreader <b>1470</b>) are used to transmit the 6-bit CRC.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In every time interval, the block encoder <b>1410</b> block-encodes the 8-bit control information at a predetermined code rate (n<sub>1</sub>, 8). An output of the block encoder <b>1410</b> is repeated and punctured by the repeater/puncturer <b>1420</b>, and then orthogonally spread (for example, with orthogonal codes) by the Walsh spreader <b>1430</b> so that the final signal can be transmitted over the control channel.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">During a time interval defined for transmitting the CRC, the CRC generator <b>1440</b> additionally operates to receive not only the current control information but also at least one predetermined previous control information, and then to generate and output a corresponding 6-bit CRC. The block encoder <b>1450</b> encodes an output of the CRC generator <b>1440</b> at a predetermined code rate (n<sub>2</sub>, 6). An output of the block encoder <b>1450</b> is repeated and punctured by the repeater/puncturer <b>1460</b>, and it is then orthogonally spread by the Walsh spreader <b>1470</b> so that it can be transmitted over the error detection channel.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Thus, during the time interval defined for transmitting the CRC, the receiver outputs not only the CRC but also control information passing through the block encoder <b>1410</b>, the repeater/puncturer <b>1420</b> and the Walsh spreader <b>1430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A controller <b>1480</b> controls the operations of the above elements, and particularly determines whether to transmit a CRC in every frame.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, elements <b>1510</b>, <b>1520</b> and <b>1530</b> (i.e., a Walsh despreader <b>1510</b>, a combiner <b>1520</b> and a block decoder <b>1530</b>) are used to receive control information over the control channel, whereas elements <b>1540</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1560</b> and <b>1570</b> (i.e., a Walsh despreader <b>1540</b>, a combiner <b>1550</b>, a block decoder <b>1560</b> and a CRC checker <b>1570</b>) are used to receive a CRC over the error detection channel.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in every time interval, the Walsh despreader <b>1510</b> orthogonally despreads a received control channel signal, and the combiner <b>1520</b> combines outputs of the Walsh despreader <b>1510</b> at a predetermined time. The combining operation of the combiner <b>1520</b> is a counterpart operation to the repeating and puncturing operation of the repeater and puncturer <b>1420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.

The CRC checker <b>1570</b> checks the CRC to determine whether there is an error in at least one control information outputted from the block decoder <b>1530</b> at least one predetermined recent frame. A target setpoint controller <b>1590</b> adjusts a power control target setpoint according to the determination by the CRC checker <b>1570</b>. If an error has occurred in the control information, the controller <b>1590</b> increases a target setpoint for the outer loop power control, and if no error is detected, the target set point controller <b>1590</b> decreases the target setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A controller <b>1580</b> controls the operations of the above elements. In particular, in every frame, the controller <b>1580</b> determines whether the current time interval is a time interval in which the CRC is received. If the determination is positive, the controller <b>1580</b> enables the elements <b>1540</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1560</b>, <b>1570</b> and <b>1590</b> for receiving the error detection channel signal. The control information obtained by the receiver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is used for the base station to obtain information relating to the HARQ and the data rate when it receives a reverse traffic channel signal.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the first and second embodiments, an encoding scheme used for a time interval in which a CRC is transmitted is different from that of a time interval in which no CRC is transmitted. Thus, when a CRC check is performed to determine whether there is an error, and outer loop power control is performed based on the determination, error probability can be maintained at a desired level in the time interval in which the CRC is transmitted, whereas error probability cannot be maintained at a desired level in the time interval in which no CRC is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the third embodiment, a CRC is separately encoded, and control information is transmitted using the same encoding scheme irrespective of whether or not the CRC is transmitted. It is burdensome for this embodiment to operate the additional channel (i.e., the error detection channel). However, by performing a CRC check in the time interval in which the CRC is received to determine whether there is an error, and then performing outer loop power control according to the determination, it is possible to maintain a uniform error probability of the control channel at a desired level in every time interval. This is because the performance evaluation through periodical CRC checks can be applied to every time interval since the same encoding scheme is used for continuously transmitted control information and a different encoding scheme is used for discontinuously transmitted CRCs. That is, if control channel error probability is maintained at 1% in the time interval in which the CRC is transmitted, the error probability is also maintained at 1% in the remaining time interval.</p>

In other words, a CRC for control information transmitted in the i+1th frame is transmitted while occupying a time interval corresponding to the i+1th to i+4th frames.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The error detection channel transmission method according to the fourth embodiment has the following advantages. First, as the time interval occupied by the CRC increases, the performance of receiving error detection channels increases due to time diversity. Second, as the error detection channel signal is dispersed over a number of frames, interference caused by the error detection channel is also dispersed over a number of frames, so that reverse system capacity can be increased in the case where a plurality of mobile terminals simultaneously transmit error detection channels.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates the transmission of control information and a CRC from a plurality of mobile terminals according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. Mobile terminals in communication with one base station to transmit reverse control channel signals and reverse error detection channel signals are divided into 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th groups. Each mobile terminal in a group uses an error detection channel in a time interval allocated to its group. The respective time intervals of the error detection channel signals transmitted by the mobile terminals are set to be as different as possible so that interference caused by the error detection channel can be dispersed, thereby increasing the reverse system capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">5. Fifth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates random CRC transmission from a mobile terminal according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the mobile terminal transmits control information in every frame while transmitting a CRC in a frame randomly selected from a predetermined period of frames. In other words, a frame in which the CRC is transmitted randomly varies in every frame period (in every 4 frames in this example). If the mobile terminal transmits the CRC in such a random manner, the possibility of simultaneous CRC transmission from a plurality of mobile terminals in a specific time interval is reduced even when a number of mobile terminals transmit error detection channel signals. This process results in the interference due to the error detection channel being dispersed. Here, a rule for the mobile terminal to select a frame in which the CRC is transmitted must be previously prescribed between the mobile and the base station or be detectable by the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">6. Sixth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a method for transmitting CRCs for a plurality of control channels by a mobile terminal according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. The control channels (or control channel signals) transmitted by the mobile terminal include 1st and 2nd control channels (Control Channels <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) that are differentiated with different spread codes. This is to enable transmission of a larger amount of control information. If two or more control channels are transmitted and a different encoding scheme is used for each of the control channels, the mobile terminal transmits two or more error detection channels corresponding to the two or more control channels. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a CRC for the 1st control channel is transmitted in the i+1th and i+5th frames, whereas a CRC for the 2nd control channel is transmitted in the i+3th and the i+7th frames. In the same manner as described above, information relating to which frame or frames are being allocated to the error detection channel for each control channel is prescribed between the base station and the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As apparent from the above description, according to the present invention, when a mobile terminal transmits control information of a traffic channel to a base station over a control channel, it transmits error detection information for the control information over the control channel or a separate error detection channel. The present invention thus has an advantage in that the base station can perform outer loop power control on the basis of the error detection information for the control information.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
