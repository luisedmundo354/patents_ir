<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit packages and more particularly to stacked integrated circuit package system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electronics demand more integrated circuits in an integrated circuit package while paradoxically providing less physical space in the system for the increased integrated circuits content. Some technologies primarily focus on integrating more functions into each integrated circuit. Other technologies focus on stacking these integrated circuits into a single package. While these approaches provide more functions within an integrated circuit, they do not fully address the requirements for lower height, smaller space, heat dissipation, and cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern consumer electronics, such as smart phones, personal digital assistants, and location based services devices, as well as enterprise electronics, such as servers and storage arrays, are packing more integrated circuits into an ever shrinking physical space with expectations for decreasing cost. Numerous technologies have been developed to meet these requirements. Some of the research and development strategies focus on new package technologies while others focus on improving the existing and mature package technologies. Research and development in the existing package technologies may take a myriad of different directions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One proven way to reduce cost is to use package technologies with existing manufacturing methods and equipments. Paradoxically, the reuse of existing manufacturing processes does not typically result in the reduction of package dimensions. Existing packaging technologies struggle to cost effectively meet the ever demanding integration of today's integrated circuits and packages.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous package approaches stack multiple integrated circuit dice or package in package (PIP) or a combination. The electrical connections to the each of the stacked integrated circuit require space typically formed by spacers, such as silicon or interposers. Current spacers require additional steps and structures increasing manufacturing costs and decreasing manufacturing yields. These spacers also limit the amount of height reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need still remains for a stacked integrated circuit package system providing low cost manufacturing, improved yields, and reduce the integrated circuit package dimensions. In view of the ever-increasing need to save costs and improve efficiencies, it is more and more critical that answers be found to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a stacked integrated circuit package-in-package system including forming a first integrated circuit spacer package including a mold compound with a recess provided therein, stacking the first integrated circuit spacer package on an integrated circuit die on a substrate with the recess positioned therebetween, and attaching a first electrical interconnect extending from the recess and connected between the integrated circuit die and the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Certain embodiments of the invention have other aspects in addition to or in place of those mentioned or obvious from the above. The aspects will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail. Likewise, the drawings showing embodiments of the apparatus are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown greatly exaggerated in the figures. The same numbers are used in all the figures to relate to the same elements.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term “horizontal” as used herein is defined as a plane parallel to the conventional integrated circuit surface, regardless of its orientation. The term “vertical” refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms, such as “above”, “below”, “bottom”, “top”, “side” (as in “sidewall”), “higher”, “lower”, “upper”, “over”, and “under”, are defined with respect to the horizontal plane. The term “on” means there is direct contact among elements.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The term “processing” as used herein includes deposition of material, patterning, exposure, development, etching, cleaning, molding, and/or removal of the material or as required in forming a described structure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a stacked integrated circuit package-in-package system <b>100</b> in an embodiment of the present invention.
