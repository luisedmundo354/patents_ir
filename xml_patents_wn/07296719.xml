<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to improvements in fuel cell fuel delivery arrangements for use in combustion tools, and more specifically to actuating the fuel cell metering valve for delivering the appropriate amount of fuel for use by a combustion tool during the driving of fasteners, as well as associated combustion tools and their components.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As exemplified in Nikolich U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,403,722, 4,483,474, 4,522,162, and 5,115,944, all of which are incorporated by reference, it is known to use a dispenser such as a fuel cell to dispense a hydrocarbon fuel to a combustion tool, also known as a combustion gas-powered tool or combustion nailer, such as, for example, a combustion gas-powered fastener-driving tool. Such fastener-driving tools and such fuel cells are available commercially from ITW-Paslode (a division of Illinois Tool Works, Inc.) of Vernon Hills, Ill., under its IMPULSE trademark. In particular, a fuel cell of this type is described in Nikolich U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,944, listed above.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One design criterion associated with the use of such fuel cells, which contain separate compartments of pressurized fuel and propellant, is the prevention of leakage of one or both of the above constituents. The objective is to prevent or minimize leakage after production and before use, also known as shelf life, and also during periods when the fuel cell is installed in the tool but the tool is stored or otherwise not in use. To address this design criterion, fuel metering valves have been used to sealingly maintain the fuel inside the fuel cell until the tool is actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another design criterion of such fuel cells is that only a desired amount of fuel should be emitted by the fuel cell for each combustion event, depending on the temperature and altitude where the tool is operated. The amount of fuel should be carefully monitored to provide the desired combustion, yet in a fuel-efficient manner to prolong the working life of the fuel cell. Prior attempts to address this dosage factor have resulted in fuel metering valves attached to the fuel cell (U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,297), or located in the fuel cell (U.S. Pat. No. 5,263,439) both of which are also incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further design consideration of such fuel cells is that emission of the fuel, and therefore actuation of the tool, should be responsive to the user. In present combustion nailers with conventional fuel delivery systems, the end user must exert approximately fourteen pounds of force to actuate the tool. This amount of required actuation force can cause fatigue and strain on the user, especially after extended use.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved combustion tool that uses a fuel cell that allows for variable fuel dosages.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is also a need for an improved combustion tool that requires relatively less actuation force by the end user.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-listed needs are met or exceeded by the present combustion tool for use with a fuel cell having a fuel metering valve. The fuel metering valve of the fuel cell emits a prescribed volume of fuel from a fuel metering chamber through a valve stem. The tool includes a fuel cell chamber configured for receiving the fuel cell. A solenoid actuator is in operational relationship to the fuel cell chamber. The solenoid actuator is configured for pushing the fuel cell against a biasing force associated with the fuel cell. When the biasing force is overcome, the fuel cell emits fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An alternate embodiment of a combustion tool for use with a fuel cell having a fuel metering valve emitting a prescribed volume of fuel from a fuel metering chamber through a valve stem is also provided. The tool includes a fuel cell chamber configured for receiving the fuel cell, and a fuel line in fluid communication with the fuel cell chamber. A solenoid actuator is in operational relationship to the fuel cell chamber and includes a lengthening member engaged with the valve stem of the fuel cell. The lengthening member is configured for axially depressing the valve stein against a biasing force. Actuation of the solenoid actuator overcomes the biasing force to emit fuel from the fuel metering valve.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also provided is another embodiment of a combustion tool for use with a fuel cell having a fuel metering valve. The fuel metering valve emits a prescribed volume of fuel from a fuel metering chamber through a valve stem and into a cylinder head. The tool includes a fuel cell chamber configured for receiving the fuel cell and a movable member in operational relationship with the cylinder head and the fuel cell chamber. The movable member is configured for reciprocal movement generally transverse to the fuel cell chamber. A solenoid actuator is disposed in the movable member. The solenoid actuator is static with respect to the cylinder head and is configured to impart a force on the movable member. Upon actuation of the solenoid actuator, the movable member moves the fuel cell, which depressed the valve stem and emits fuel.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a brief discussion of two embodiments of fuel cells <b>10</b> of the type used in a combustion tool having a solenoid actuator follows herewith. While two preferred embodiments are described, it will be appreciated that the type and configuration of fuel cell <b>10</b> can vary in accordance with the present combustion tool with a solenoid actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The fuel cell is generally designated <b>10</b>, and includes an outer housing or shell <b>12</b> defining an open upper end <b>14</b> enclosed by a closure <b>16</b> which is sealingly secured to the housing at a peripheral edge <b>18</b> which overlaps and is preferably crimped over the upper end, as is well known in the art. The general construction of such fuel cells is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,263,439, and 6,302,297 incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Inside the housing <b>12</b>, a first space <b>20</b> is defined for a first component, which is typically a pressurized propellant. Also provided within the housing <b>12</b> is a container <b>22</b> defining a second space <b>24</b> for a second component, typically a combustible fuel, such as MAPP gas or other combustible gas which is liquefied under pressure. While it is preferred that the first space <b>20</b> encloses the propellant and the second space <b>24</b> the fuel, a reverse arrangement is contemplated as long as there is an environment created within the housing <b>12</b> to pressurize the fuel and maintain that pressure as the amount of fuel is reduced, as through consumption or other factors. A feature of the present fuel cell <b>10</b> is the location of an internal fuel metering valve, generally designated <b>25</b>, within the housing <b>12</b>. However, as will be seen later, fuel cells <b>10</b> may also use an external fuel metering valve (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The internal fuel metering valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 10/827,551 filed on Apr. 19, 2004, and is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A main valve stem <b>26</b> is configured for emitting fuel from the housing <b>12</b> and as such has an outlet <b>28</b> at a first end <b>30</b> projecting from the housing, and a second end <b>31</b> opposite the first end. The valve stem <b>26</b> is in fluid communication with the source of fuel, preferably the container <b>22</b>. The first and second ends <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> are separated from each other, preferably by a passageway <b>32</b>. To emit fuel, the main valve stem <b>26</b> reciprocates relative to the housing <b>12</b> within a valve body <b>34</b> under a biasing force, preferably exerted by a biasing element <b>36</b> such as a spring, between a closed position (shown on the left half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and an open position (shown on the right half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the closed position, the main valve stem <b>26</b> is biased by the biasing element <b>36</b> to an extended condition. In the open position, the main valve stem <b>26</b> is pushed back or retracted in a way that overcomes the biasing force of the element <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The internal fuel metering valve <b>25</b> includes the main valve stem <b>26</b> and is configured so that so that when the stem is in the open position, only a measured amount of fuel is dispensed through the outlet <b>28</b>. It is preferred that the fuel metering valve <b>25</b> is configured so that the main valve stem is in the open position only when fuel is being dispensed to the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fuel metering valve <b>25</b> includes a fuel metering chamber <b>38</b> located within the housing <b>12</b>. Preferably, the fuel metering chamber <b>38</b> is located within the valve body <b>34</b>, however locations externally of the valve body are also contemplated. A chamber body <b>40</b> sealingly engages a main or outlet seal <b>42</b> for preventing unwanted leakage. A second component <b>44</b> includes a generally flexible, radially inwardly projecting lip <b>46</b> which slidingly and wipingly engages the reciprocating main valve stem <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The main valve stem <b>26</b> is configured for permitting the delivery of a designated amount of fuel to the fuel metering chamber <b>38</b> in the closed position, and for receiving that designated amount of fuel in the open position for emission through the outlet <b>28</b>. To that end, among other things, the main valve stem <b>26</b> includes at least one inlet <b>48</b> and at least one generally radially projecting formation functioning as a stop member <b>50</b>. The inlet <b>48</b>, which is in fluid communication with the passageway <b>32</b>, receives fuel from the fuel metering chamber <b>38</b> while the main valve stem <b>26</b> is in the open position, at which time the inlet is located within the fuel metering chamber. The main valve stem <b>26</b> is closed at the second end <b>31</b> and fuel enters the passageway <b>32</b> through the inlet <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the closed position, the inlet <b>48</b> is no longer located within the fuel metering chamber <b>38</b>, and is preferably external of the closure <b>16</b>. The at least one stop member <b>50</b> is positioned on the main valve stem <b>26</b> so that it engages the outlet seal <b>42</b> and prevents further movement of the valve stem past the closure <b>16</b>. An enlarged portion <b>52</b> is of sufficient diameter to sealingly engage the lip seal <b>46</b> and prevent the passage of fuel into or out of the entry of fuel relative to the fuel metering chamber <b>38</b>. A standard or relatively narrow diameter portion <b>54</b> of the main valve stem <b>26</b> is located between the stop <b>50</b> and the enlarged portion <b>52</b>. At the opposite end, the generally enlarged portion <b>52</b> gradually reduces in diameter to form a seat <b>56</b> for the biasing element <b>36</b>. An opposite end of the biasing element engages an end <b>58</b> of a body cavity <b>60</b> in the main valve body <b>34</b> in which reciprocates the main valve stem <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The dosing of the fuel cell <b>10</b> occurs as follows. Fuel can pass the lip seal <b>46</b> and enter the fuel metering chamber <b>38</b> when the main valve stem <b>26</b> is in the closed position. Fuel enters the chamber <b>38</b> through the body cavity <b>60</b> which, in turn is in fluid communication with a nipple portion <b>62</b> of the valve body <b>34</b>. A receiving end <b>64</b> of the nipple portion <b>62</b> of the valve body <b>34</b> is located within, and is in fluid communication with the second space <b>24</b>, which preferably contains the fuel. As such, fuel enters the nipple portion <b>62</b>, the cavity <b>60</b> and the metering chamber <b>38</b> prior to being emitted from the outlet <b>28</b>. The amount of fuel located in the fuel metering chamber <b>38</b> is a dose of fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an external metering valve, generally designated <b>66</b>, will be described herein. The valve operates in a generally similar manner as the internal fuel metering valve <b>25</b> except that it is located external to the fuel cell. The metering valve <b>66</b> is shown transverse to the housing <b>12</b>, although other orientations are contemplated such as the metering valve being inline with housing <b>12</b>. The metering valve <b>66</b> has a generally circular intake port <b>68</b> that is defined by a tapered wall <b>70</b>. An intake orifice <b>72</b> is defined above, and is in fluid communication with the intake port <b>68</b>, and leads into a body chamber <b>74</b>. In fluid communication with the body chamber <b>74</b> is a metering chamber <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The valve <b>66</b> also contains a valve stem <b>78</b> which extends out of the valve body <b>79</b> and has an outlet end <b>80</b> and a biased end <b>82</b>. On the biased end <b>82</b>, a locating lug <b>84</b> is found on a necked down portion <b>86</b> of the valve stein <b>78</b>, where a spring <b>88</b> disposed in the body chamber <b>74</b> engages the valve stem <b>78</b>. Also on the valve stem <b>78</b> is a passageway <b>90</b> extending from the locating lug <b>84</b> to the outlet end, and a valve stem orifice <b>92</b> in fluid communication with the passageway <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">There is a lip seal <b>94</b> inside the metering chamber <b>76</b> which allows fuel to travel from the body chamber <b>74</b> to the metering chamber. There is also an outlet seal <b>96</b> located inside the valve body <b>79</b> which prevents leakage of any fuel contained in the metering chamber <b>76</b>. The valve stem <b>78</b> further has a radial stop <b>98</b> formed thereon, which abuts the outlet seal <b>96</b>. The valve stem <b>78</b> has two areas with a smaller diameter <b>100</b> and larger diameter. The clearance between the smaller diameter <b>100</b> and the lip seal <b>94</b> allows fuel to flow between the body chamber <b>74</b> and the metering chamber <b>76</b> as long as the valve stem is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The fuel cell includes a tubular valve <b>102</b>, which is connected to a fuel cell stem <b>104</b>. When the valve <b>66</b> is engaged upon the fuel cell, the fuel cell stem <b>104</b> is matingly engaged into the intake port <b>68</b>, which engagement is facilitated by the wall <b>70</b>. Upon engagement, the fuel cell stem <b>104</b> is depressed against a biasing element (not shown), permitting the fuel inside the fuel cell <b>10</b> to escape out of the fuel cell stem <b>78</b>, through the intake orifice <b>72</b>, and into the body chamber <b>74</b>. From the body chamber <b>74</b>, the fuel flows between the lip seal <b>94</b> and the valve stem <b>78</b> to fill the metering chamber <b>76</b>. Once the fuel cell <b>10</b> and the metering valve <b>66</b> are operationally engaged inside a combustion tool, the valve stem <b>78</b> is forced inward or to the right as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, compressing the spring <b>88</b> far enough so that the valve stem orifice is moved into the metering chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the valve stein <b>78</b> is biased against the spring <b>88</b>, the increasing diameter of the valve stem pushes against the lip seal <b>94</b>, preventing any more fuel from entering the metering chamber <b>76</b> from the body chamber <b>74</b>. After the metering chamber <b>76</b> is sealed off, the fuel in the metering chamber travels through the valve stem orifice <b>92</b>, into and through the valve stein <b>78</b>, and finally into the combustion tool.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a tool for use with fuel cells <b>10</b> of the type described above is designated generally at <b>106</b> and is described herein. It is contemplated that the tool <b>106</b> can be used with fuel cells having different configurations, but which operate generally under the same mechanical operations and conditions. In particular, it is contemplated that the tool <b>106</b> can be used with any fuel cell <b>10</b> in which a biasing force must be overcome to emit fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The tool <b>106</b> includes a battery (not shown), a trigger switch <b>108</b> and a workpiece contact element (not shown). The trigger switch <b>108</b> initiates current from a control module <b>110</b>, which is connected by wires <b>112</b> to the trigger <b>114</b>, which in turn, permits current to pass through the wires to a solenoid actuator <b>116</b>. A manual trigger <b>114</b> is provided for closing the trigger switch <b>108</b>. While a solenoid actuator is preferred, it is contemplated that any electrically powered, mechanically operating actuator may be employed to produce the desired force or motion on the fuel cell <b>10</b>. Thus, for the purpose of the present application, “solenoid” applies to any electrically powered mechanical actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As is known in the art, the tool <b>106</b> has an outer housing <b>118</b> encapsulating the tool components, for example a combustion chamber <b>120</b>, a nosepiece (not shown), a fastener magazine (not shown) and a handle <b>122</b>. A fuel cell chamber <b>124</b> is located within the outer housing <b>118</b> and is configured to receive the fuel cell <b>10</b>. A cylinder head <b>125</b> is generally located at the top of the combustion chamber <b>120</b>. Between the fuel cell chamber <b>124</b> and the combustion chamber <b>120</b> is a passageway or fuel line <b>126</b> in which the fuel flows from the fuel cell <b>10</b> to the combustion chamber <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Prior to the combustion event, the workpiece contact element is placed in contact with the workpiece (not shown) and a tool frame (not shown) is depressed against the workpiece contact element. When the workpiece contact element is pressed firmly against the workpiece, a movable member or valve sleeve <b>128</b> closes the combustion chamber <b>120</b>. A fan <b>130</b> is preferably operably disposed in the combustion chamber <b>120</b> to mix fuel and air prior to combustion, and to exhaust combustion gases post combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The depression of the workpiece contact element triggers several internal operational steps as are well known in the art, including the dispensing of a dose or metered amount of fuel into the fuel line <b>126</b> from the valve stein <b>26</b>, <b>78</b>, as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, respectively. However, this depression requires the end user to exert force on the tool. The force exerted on the tool accomplishes at least two operations. First, the force mechanically moves the movable member <b>128</b> (and in the case of the external fuel metering valve, also moves the fuel cell in the transverse direction), and second, the force overcomes the spring-force of the biasing element <b>36</b> (in the internal valve), as well as stem spring <b>88</b> (in the external valve) to permit the main valve stem <b>26</b>, <b>78</b> to reciprocate longitudinally relative to the fuel cell housing <b>12</b>. In the conventional tool, the end user must apply a force of about 14 lbs to operate the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the solenoid actuator <b>116</b> is located at a bottom surface <b>132</b> of the fuel cell chamber <b>124</b>. The preferred solenoid actuator <b>116</b> includes a stationary stator core <b>134</b> and a movable armature <b>136</b>. The armature <b>136</b> extends from the stationary iron core <b>134</b> when current from the wire set <b>112</b> flows through a coil (not shown) inside the stator core. Current through the coil creates a magnetic field, and the armature <b>136</b> moves linearly away from the coil. The movable armature <b>136</b> is spring-loaded (not shown) as is known in the art to allow the armature to retract when the current from the wire <b>112</b> is switched off.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, the solenoid actuator <b>116</b> is electrically connected to the control module <b>110</b> with the wire <b>112</b>. When the user depresses the tool's workpiece contact element against a work surface, the valve sleeve <b>128</b> moves to its uppermost position thereby actuating a chamber switch <b>137</b>. The chamber switch provides a signal to the control module <b>110</b> to send current through wire set <b>112</b> to the solenoid actuator <b>116</b>, which in turn, creates a magnetic field and results in the movement of the armature. The movement of the armature <b>136</b> is preferably parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fuel cell <b>10</b>. In the preferred embodiment, when the armature <b>136</b> extends from the solenoid actuator <b>116</b>, it pushes on a bottom surface <b>138</b> of the fuel cell <b>10</b>. The fuel cell <b>10</b> is pushed by the armature <b>136</b>, overcoming the bias of the spring element <b>36</b> in the valve stein <b>26</b>, and the stem is moved into the open position to permit the flow of fuel from the fuel cell to the fuel line <b>126</b> and into the combustion chamber <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, the solenoid actuator <b>116</b> provides electrically controlled, mechanical advantage to the tool <b>106</b> to perform the steps required to permit the flow of fuel to the combustion chamber <b>120</b>. The electro-mechanical advantage of the solenoid actuator <b>116</b> is about seven pounds of force applied by the user, reducing the amount of force required to actuate the tool <b>106</b> from fourteen pounds of force to seven pounds of force.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another embodiment of a solenoid actuator is provided and is generally designated <b>216</b>. Shared components with prior embodiments are designated with identical reference numbers. The solenoid actuator <b>216</b> includes a lengthening member <b>218</b>, preferably an “L”-shaped arm, attached to the armature <b>136</b>. Extension of the armature <b>136</b> from the stator core <b>134</b> causes the arm <b>218</b> to push up on the fuel cell <b>10</b>. While this embodiment is shown with a fuel cell <b>10</b> having the internal fuel metering valve <b>25</b>, it is contemplated that the solenoid actuator <b>216</b> can be used with a fuel cell having an external fuel metering valve <b>66</b>, more specifically with the valve oriented inline with fuel cell <b>10</b>. It is also contemplated that other shapes and arrangements of arms <b>218</b> can be used, and further, that the armature <b>136</b> and the core <b>134</b> can be located at other positions relative to the fuel cell <b>10</b>. Further still, it is contemplated that the lengthening member <b>218</b> can be in shapes other than an arm-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Pushing up on the fuel cell <b>10</b> causes the valve stem <b>26</b> to depress against the tool <b>106</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the valve stem <b>26</b> is pushed up against the cylinder head <b>125</b> or an extension thereof. When the valve stem <b>26</b> is depressed, the stem is in the open position, and fuel is emitted from the fuel metering valve <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another embodiment of a solenoid actuator is generally designated <b>316</b> and has a lengthening member <b>318</b>. Again, shared components with other embodiments are designated with identical reference numbers. The lengthening member <b>318</b> is preferably a lever arm that provides a further mechanical advantage. The lever arm <b>318</b> is preferably pivotable about a fulcrum <b>322</b>, which is preferably attached to the tool <b>106</b>. Upon extension of the armature <b>136</b> from the core <b>134</b>, force is imparted on a first end <b>324</b> of the lever arm <b>318</b>, causing the lever arm to pivot and to push down on the valve stem <b>26</b> with a second end <b>326</b> of the lever arm. In a preferred embodiment, the lever arm <b>318</b> also includes a contact element <b>328</b> which extends from the second end <b>326</b> of the lever arm. The contact element <b>328</b> is configured to engage and depress the stem <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic of the fuel cell <b>10</b> with the internal fuel metering valve <b>25</b>, it is contemplated that the solenoid actuator <b>316</b> with the lever arm can be used with the fuel cell having an external fuel metering valve <b>66</b>. In addition, the particular size, shape and arrangement of the lever arm <b>318</b>, and the relative positioning of the actuator <b>316</b> to the fuel cell <b>10</b>, and the positioning of the fulcrum <b>322</b> can be varied. Similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, pushing up on the fuel cell <b>10</b> causes the valve stem <b>26</b> to depress against the tool <b>106</b>. In this embodiment, when the valve stem <b>26</b> is depressed, the stem is in the open position and fuel is emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a schematic of the tool <b>106</b> configured for use with the external fuel metering valve <b>66</b> is shown. The external fuel metering valve <b>66</b> has the valve stem <b>78</b> that is generally oriented 90-degrees from the longitudinal direction of the fuel cell <b>10</b>. A solenoid actuator <b>416</b> is located in a movable member, preferably a box-like fuel compartment <b>418</b>, which is located adjacent a cylinder head wall <b>420</b> that separates the fuel cell chamber <b>124</b> from the cylinder head <b>125</b>. The movable fuel compartment <b>418</b> moves reciprocally back in forth by the solenoid actuator <b>416</b> as shown by the bi-directional arrows. While a rectangular compartment <b>418</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is contemplated that any linkage between the solenoid actuator <b>416</b> and the fuel cell <b>10</b>, such as a cradle or a tether, can be used as a movable member. Further, while only a top portion of the fuel cell <b>10</b> is preferably linked to the solenoid actuator, it is contemplated that any portion of the fuel cell can be linked with the movable member <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The stator core <b>134</b> of the solenoid actuator <b>416</b> is stationary with respect to the cylinder head wall <b>420</b>. Upon actuation, the armature <b>136</b> of the solenoid actuator <b>416</b> extends, pulling the movable fuel compartment <b>418</b> toward the cylinder head <b>125</b>. When the fuel compartment <b>418</b> moves toward the cylinder head <b>125</b>, the fuel cell contained in the compartment <b>418</b> also moves with the compartment (to the left, as shown in the schematic).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As the fuel cell <b>10</b> is moved with the compartment, the valve stem <b>78</b> is pushed against a feeding element <b>422</b>. The feeding element <b>422</b> is preferably attached to and stationary with respect to the cylinder head wall <b>420</b>. The movement of the fuel cell <b>10</b> against the stationary feeding element <b>422</b> provides enough force to overcome the spring <b>88</b> in the external metering valve <b>66</b>, and to emit fuel from the valve stem <b>78</b>. The feeding element <b>422</b> works in cooperation with a fuel line <b>126</b> to feed fuel to the cylinder head <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that the various solenoid actuator embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> are mechanical variations using similar solenoid actuation principles. The present solenoid actuator invention should not be limited to the specific embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The solenoid actuators <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>416</b> not only lessen the force required to be imparted by the user, but also permit the user to control the number of doses within a single tool actuation. Since the solenoid actuator <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>416</b> can actuate quickly, the actuator can actuate multiple times in the amount of time it takes to actuate the tool and the operator can pull the trigger. By sending current through the wire set <b>112</b> to the solenoid actuator <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>416</b> (thereby extending the armature <b>136</b>), and then stopping the flow of current, (thereby retracting the armature), and subsequently sending current (thereby extending the armature), yields two doses within the same trigger actuation by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Multiple dosing of the fuel cell <b>10</b> is controlled by the control module <b>110</b> pulsing the solenoid actuator <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>416</b>. Alternately, a switch (not shown) or other controller can be used by the user to set the amount of times current is sent by the control module <b>110</b> through the wire set <b>112</b> to the solenoid actuator <b>116</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>416</b> within a trigger event. However, it is contemplated that the dosing can be controlled by other means.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The dosage of the metering valve <b>25</b>, <b>66</b> can be sized such that multiple dosages provide sufficient fuel to provide the proper fuel to air required for combustion. For example, two doses can be dispensed per combustion cycle for summer applications, and three doses can provided during winter usage. It is contemplated that the dosage can be sized to provide smaller dosages, which when dosed multiple times, provides more accurate fuel to air ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While particular embodiments of the present solenoid actuators and associated combustion tool has been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the invention in its broader aspects and as set forth in the following claims.</p>
