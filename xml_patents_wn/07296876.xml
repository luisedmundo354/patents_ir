<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid ejection apparatus adapted to eject liquid on a target medium supported on a platen, and relates to a holder for a liquid absorber incorporated in the platen.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, as an ink jet printer serving as a liquid ejecting apparatus, there is a type which performs printing without remaining any margin on the entire surface of sheet serving as a target medium, that is, which can execute a so-called marginless printing. In such an ink jet printer, a platen which supports paper and defines the position of the paper with respect to a printing head is provided with recesses for discarding ink droplets ejected outside of the edges of the paper. An ink absorber made of material such as polypropylene in a sponge state, which is high in porosity and good in ink absorbability, is integrally attached into the recesses for discarding ink. Such a configuration is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 2004-155109A (JP-A-2004-155109).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the aforesaid ink jet printer, an amount of ink capable of being absorbed into the ink absorber is limited. Thus, when the absorbed amount of the ink reaches the limited value, the ink absorber is required to be replaced. In this case, since the ink absorber is integrally attached to the platen, it is required to replacement the platen entirely. However, it is difficult to make the state of the platen after the replacement coincide completely with the state of the platen before the replacement, and so the printing state may change between the state before the replacement and the state after the replacement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore one advantage of some aspect of the invention to provide a liquid ejection apparatus which can prevent the change of a liquid ejection state with respect to a target medium between states before and after the replacement of ink absorber.</p>

Thus, the keeping or management etc., which is necessary in the case of sheet support of a detachable type, is not required in this case. Further, since the first sheet support <b>132</b> has the multi-stage structure, various sizes of sheets to be fed can be surely supported. After using the ink jet printer <b>100</b>, when the multi-stage portion of the first sheet support <b>132</b> is pushed in, the first sheet feeding port <b>131</b> is closed. Thus, dust is prevented from entering into the main body of the printer and the first sheet support <b>132</b> can be housed in a compact size.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The second rear sheet feeding section <b>140</b> is used for the manual sheet feeding and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, includes a second sheet support <b>142</b> of two stage structure which has a function of supporting a sheet to be fed as well as a function of opening and closing a second sheet feeding port <b>141</b> opened in a rectangular shape backward. The second sheet support <b>142</b> is attached so as to be pivotable in directions shown by arrows d in the figure about the pivot shaft at the lower end thereof. Sheets fed from the second rear sheet feeding section <b>140</b> are ones each having a relatively thin thickness such as plain paper.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Before using the ink jet printer <b>100</b>, a user hooks the finger with the upper portion of the second sheet support <b>142</b> shown in the figure and pushes the second sheet support <b>142</b> down to draw out the multi-stage portion thereby to complete the setting operation. Thus, the keeping or management etc., which is necessary in the case of the sheet support of the detachable type, is not required in this case. Further, since the second sheet support <b>142</b> has the multi-stage structure, sheets of various sizes to be fed can be surely supported. After using the ink jet printer <b>100</b>, when the multi-stage portion of the second sheet support <b>142</b> is pushed in and the first sheet support is closed, the second sheet feeding port <b>141</b> can be closed. Thus, dust is prevented from entering into the main body of the printer and the second sheet support <b>142</b> can be housed in a compact size.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sheet ejecting section <b>150</b> includes a stacker <b>152</b> of a two-stage structure having a first stacker <b>51</b> and a second stacker <b>52</b> each of which has a function of stacking one or more sheets to be ejected as well as a function of opening and closing a sheet ejecting port <b>151</b> opened in a rectangular shape in the forward direction. The first stacker <b>51</b> is attached so as to be pivotable in directions shown by arrows e in the figure about the pivot shaft at the tip end side of the second stacker <b>52</b>. The second stacker <b>52</b> is attached so as to move obliquely in the vertical direction and in parallel to the sheet ejecting port <b>151</b> thereby to be able to protrude and be housed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Before using the ink jet printer <b>100</b>, a user hooks the finger with the upper portion of the first stacker <b>51</b> to pivot the first stacker <b>51</b> in the front direction thereby to open the sheet ejecting port <b>151</b>, then draws out the first stacker <b>51</b> to move the second stacker <b>52</b> obliquely upward in parallel to the sheet ejecting port to protrude the second stacker, thereby completing the setting operation. Thus, the keeping or management etc., which is necessary in the case of a stacker of a detachable type, is not required in this case. Further, since the stacker <b>152</b> has the multi-stage structure, various sizes of sheets to be ejected can be surely placed in a stacked manner. Furthermore, since sheets having been subjected to the printing are always ejected from the front face side, a user can easily take the sheets out. After using the ink jet printer <b>100</b>, when a user pushes in the tip end of the first stacker <b>51</b> by the hand, the second stacker <b>52</b> is moved obliquely downward in parallel to the sheet ejecting port and housed. Further, when the first stacker <b>51</b> is pivoted backward by putting a hand on the first stacker <b>51</b>, the sheet ejecting port <b>151</b> can be closed. Thus, dust is prevented from entering into the main body of the printer and the stacker <b>152</b> can be housed in a compact size.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The front sheet feeding section <b>160</b> is used for the manual sheet feeding and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes a sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> provided above the stacker <b>152</b> at the sheet ejecting port <b>151</b>. The sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> is provided so as to be movable in the horizontal direction and in parallel to the sheet ejecting port <b>151</b>. Sheets fed from the front sheet feeding section <b>160</b> are ones each having a relatively large thickness such as mat paper which can not be bent at the time of transport.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Before using the ink jet printer <b>100</b>, when a user slightly pushes in the tip end of the sheet feeding tray <b>161</b>, the stopper of the sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> is disengaged and so the sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> protrudes from the sheet ejecting port <b>151</b>. After using the ink jet printer <b>100</b>, when the tip end of the sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> is pushed in slightly, the stopper of the sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> is engaged and so the sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> is housed within the sheet ejecting port <b>151</b>. Thus, the housing efficiency for disposing the sheet feeding tray <b>161</b> can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, a waste ink tank <b>171</b> for reserving waste ink etc. is removably housed in the waste ink recovering section <b>170</b>. The waste ink tank <b>171</b> reserves waste ink etc. which is discarded at the time of cleaning the printing head <b>202</b> and replacing an ink cartridge. When the waste ink tank <b>171</b> is filled with the waste ink etc., a user is merely required to draw the waste ink tank <b>171</b> out and insert a new waste ink tank <b>171</b>. Thus, the replacement operation of the waste ink tank <b>171</b> can be performed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the sheet transporting section <b>180</b> is provided over an area from the first rear sheet feeding section <b>130</b>, the second rear sheet feeding section <b>140</b> to the sheet ejecting section <b>150</b> and includes an automatic sheet feeding mechanism <b>181</b>, a transporting mechanism <b>183</b> and sheet ejecting mechanism <b>183</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the automatic sheet feeding mechanism <b>181</b> includes, for example, a hopper <b>81</b> for lifting sheets supported by the first sheet support <b>132</b> in order to feed the sheets, a sheet feeding roller <b>82</b> for taking out the sheets lifted by the holler <b>81</b>, a retard roller <b>83</b> for separating only one paper from the sheets fed together by the sheet feeding roller <b>82</b>, and a sheet returning lever <b>84</b> for returning the remaining sheets thus separated by the retard roller <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The hopper <b>81</b> is formed in a flat shape so that sheets can be placed thereon and is provided almost in parallel to the rear wall. The hopper is provided in a manner that the lower end thereof is positioned near the sheet feeding roller <b>82</b> and the upper end thereof is positioned near the top portion of the rear wall. Further, the hopper <b>81</b> is provided in a manner that the other end of a not-shown compression spring which one end is attached to the rear wall is attached to the rear face of the lower end side thereof, whereby the lower end side pivots about the upper end side in accordance with the expansion/compression of the compression spring.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The sheet feeding roller <b>82</b> having a D-shaped cross section is provided near the lower end of the hopper <b>81</b>. The sheet feeding roller <b>82</b> rotates intermittently to feed with friction the sheets lifted by the hopper <b>81</b>. The retard roller <b>83</b> is provided so as to be able to abut against the sheet feeding roller <b>82</b> and acts to separate with friction only the uppermost paper from the sheets fed together by the sheet feeding roller <b>82</b>. The sheet returning lever <b>84</b> is formed in a nail shape and is provided near the sheet feeding roller <b>82</b>. The sheet returning lever hooks by the nail the remaining sheets separated by the retard roller <b>83</b> and returns the remaining sheets to the hopper <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the transporting mechanism <b>183</b> is provided with a sheet transporting roller <b>85</b> which transports a sheet in a secondary scanning direction (the lateral direction in this figure) in synchronism with the printing operation and a follower roller <b>86</b> etc. The sheet transporting roller <b>85</b> is provided in the upstream side of the sheet transporting path of the platen <b>203</b> and acts to hold, together with the follower roller <b>86</b>, the sheet fed by the sheet feeding roller <b>82</b> and to transport the sheet to the platen <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sheet ejecting mechanism <b>183</b> includes a sheet ejecting roller <b>87</b>, a first spur roller <b>88</b><i>a, </i>a second spur roller <b>88</b><i>b </i>etc. The first spur roller <b>88</b><i>a </i>is provided in the downstream side of the sheet transporting path of the platen <b>203</b>, whist the second spur roller <b>88</b><i>b </i>and the sheet ejecting roller <b>87</b> are provided in an opposed manner in the downstream side of the sheet transporting path of the first spur roller <b>88</b><i>a. </i>First, the first spur roller <b>88</b><i>a </i>ejects the sheet passed through the platen <b>203</b>, and then the second spur roller <b>88</b><i>b </i>and the sheet ejecting roller <b>87</b> hold the sheet thus ejected and eject the sheet on the stacker <b>152</b>. The first spur roller <b>88</b><i>a </i>and the second spur roller <b>88</b><i>b </i>are held by a not-shown same holding member.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the controller <b>190</b> includes a main board <b>191</b> constituting a printer controller. On the main board <b>191</b>, there are provided a control element and a memory element such as a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, an ASIC and other various kinds of circuit elements, each being not shown, thereby to control the sheet transporting section <b>180</b> and the printing section <b>200</b> constituting a print engine.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the printing section <b>200</b>, there are provided a carriage <b>201</b> which moves in a primary scanning direction (perpendicular to the secondary scanning direction) in synchronism with the printing operation, the printing head <b>202</b> which ejects ink in synchronism with the printing operation, and the platen <b>203</b> which supports a sheet in a flat state upon printing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the carriage <b>201</b> is supported by a carriage guide shaft <b>204</b> above the platen <b>203</b> and coupled to a carriage belt <b>205</b>. When a not-shown carriage motor drives the carriage belt <b>205</b>, the carriage moves reciprocally along the carriage guide shaft <b>204</b> in accordance with the movement of the carriage belt <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the printing head <b>202</b> is mounted on the carriage <b>201</b> so as to be spaced from the platen <b>203</b> by a predetermined distance. The printing head can eject plural kinds of ink (e.g., black, photo black, mat black, yellow, cyan, light cyan, magenta, light magenta, gray and red). That is, the printing head <b>202</b> is arranged in a manner that a pressure generating chamber and a nozzle orifice communicating therewith are provided at a nozzle plate, whereby when ink is reserved within the pressure generating chamber and the ink is pressurized with a predetermined pressure, so that an ink droplet having a controlled magnitude is ejected toward a sheet from the nozzle orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The platen (medium supporting member) <b>203</b> is provided so as to oppose to the printing head <b>202</b> between the sheet transporting roller <b>85</b> and the sheet ejecting roller <b>87</b> and supports a sheet being transported on the surface thereof. The platen <b>203</b> has an elongated plate shape having a width dimension in the primary scanning direction which is slightly greater than the maximum width of a sheet to which printing can be executed. An absorber holder <b>32</b> for holding an ink absorber <b>31</b> is detachably provided in the platen <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ink absorber <b>31</b> includes ink receiving portions <b>31</b><i>a </i>for receiving and absorbing ink droplets ejected out of the edge of a sheet upon the marginless printing, and ink leading portions <b>31</b><i>b </i>which are formed integrally with the ink receiving portions <b>31</b><i>a </i>to lead waste ink absorbed by the ink receiving portions <b>31</b><i>a </i>to a not-shown waste ink tray provided beneath. The ink receiving portions <b>31</b><i>a </i>are formed in a pectinated manner. The ink receiving portions <b>31</b><i>a </i>include extended portions <b>31</b><i>ab </i>extending in the secondary scanning direction and connecting portions <b>31</b><i>aa </i>each of which extends in the primary scanning direction and connects adjacent extended portions <b>31</b><i>ab. </i>The ink leading portions <b>31</b><i>b </i>are formed in a pectinated manner so as to be almost orthogonal to the extended portions <b>31</b><i>ab </i>at the connecting portions <b>31</b><i>aa. </i>As material of such the ink absorber <b>31</b>, porous material such as polypropylene or polyethylene in a sponge state is used which has a high ink absorbing property and a performance hardly affected by the ink (high ink resistance property) and is excellent in elasticity and flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The absorber holder <b>32</b> is formed so as to be slightly larger than the ink receiving portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the ink absorber <b>31</b> and to have: first recesses <b>32</b><i>a </i>each extending in the primary scanning direction and capable of housing the connecting portion <b>31</b><i>aa </i>of the ink receiving portion <b>31</b><i>a; </i>second recesses <b>32</b><i>b </i>each extending in the secondary scanning direction and capable of housing the extended portion <b>31</b><i>ab </i>of the ink receiving portion <b>31</b><i>a; </i>and through holes <b>32</b><i>c </i>each capable of receiving the tip end of the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b. </i>The absorber holder <b>32</b> is provided with projections <b>32</b><i>d </i>on the front side face of the absorber holder <b>32</b> which is in the upstream side of the sheet transporting direction (the secondary scanning direction), and also provided with projections <b>32</b><i>e </i>on the both side faces thereof in the downstream side of the sheet transporting direction, respectively. The absorber holder <b>32</b> is detachable with respect to a recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>which is formed on the upper face of the platen <b>203</b> in the upstream side of the sheet transporting direction and has almost the same shape as the absorber holder <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the case of attaching the absorber holder <b>32</b> to the platen <b>203</b>, first, the absorber holder <b>32</b> is inserted into the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b> in a state that the front face of the absorber holder <b>32</b> is directed downward. Then, the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the ink absorber <b>31</b> is inserted into a through hole <b>32</b><i>c </i>perforated at the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>and also the projections <b>32</b><i>d </i>of the absorber holder <b>32</b> is engaged with retainers <b>203</b><i>b </i>formed within the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b>. Next, the rear side (the downstream side of the sheet transporting direction) of the absorber holder <b>32</b> is pushed down within the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b> while bringing the fixing projection <b>32</b><i>e </i>slide contact with the inner side wall of the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b> thereby to attach the absorber holder <b>32</b> to the platen <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On the other hand, in the case of detaching the absorber holder <b>32</b> from the platen <b>203</b>, first, the rear side of the absorber holder <b>32</b> is pulled up from the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b>. Then, the upstream side of the sheet transporting direction of the absorber holder <b>32</b> is pulled up obliquely from the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b>, thereby detaching the absorber holder <b>32</b> from the platen <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second recesses <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the absorber holder <b>32</b> respectively attached to the recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b> are positioned in parallel to the platen <b>203</b> in the upstream side of the sheet transporting direction of the platen <b>203</b>. The first recesses <b>32</b><i>a </i>are provided mainly in order to discard ink droplets ejected outside of the leading edge of sheet at the time of performing the marginless printing. The second recesses <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the absorber holder <b>32</b> respectively attached to the recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b> are locally provided at the positions corresponding to the left and right side edges of each sheet to which printing is executable. The second recesses <b>32</b><i>b </i>are provided mainly in order to discard ink droplets ejected outside of the left and right edges of sheet at the time of performing the marginless printing. A plurality of ribs <b>203</b><i>b </i>each extending to the sheet transporting direction are provided with a predetermined interval on the platen <b>203</b> between the second recesses <b>32</b><i>b. </i>Each of the ribs <b>203</b><i>b </i>has an almost trapezoidal shape in its section and acts to support a sheet being transported from the rear face side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The bottom face <b>203</b><i>aa </i>of each of the recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b> is formed so as to slope downward from the downstream side of the sheet transporting direction to the upstream side of the sheet transporting direction, that is, toward the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b. </i>Further, similarly, the bottom faces <b>32</b><i>f </i>of the absorber holder <b>32</b> respectively opposing to the bottom faces <b>203</b><i>aa </i>of the inclined recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>of the platen <b>203</b> are also formed so as to slope downward from the downstream side of the sheet transporting direction to the upstream side of the sheet transporting direction, that is, toward the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b. </i>Thus, even ink absorbed in the downstream side of the sheet transporting direction of the ink absorber <b>31</b> flows down without being accumulated along the bottom faces <b>203</b><i>aa </i>of the inclined recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>and the bottom faces <b>32</b><i>f </i>of the absorber holder <b>32</b> due to the gravitation, so that almost all waste ink absorbed in the ink absorber <b>31</b> can be ejected into the ink recovering tray.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As described above, according to the ink jet printer <b>100</b> of this embodiment, the absorber holder <b>32</b> holds the ink absorber <b>31</b> which receives ink discarded at the time of ejecting ink toward a sheet without remaining any margin on the entire face of the sheet, and the absorber holder <b>32</b> is made detachable with respect to the platen <b>203</b>. Thus, the ink absorber <b>31</b> can be replaced without removing the platen <b>203</b>. Accordingly, the supporting state of sheet transporting on the platen <b>203</b> does not change between the state before the replacement of the ink absorber <b>31</b> and the state after the replacement thereof, so that the ejection state of ink with respect to the sheet can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The absorber holder <b>32</b> is fit into and attached to the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>formed at the platen <b>203</b>. This attachment operation is performed in a manner that the upstream side of the sheet transporting direction of the absorber holder <b>32</b> is inserted into the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>and then the downstream side of the sheet transporting direction thereof is pushed into the recess <b>203</b><i>a. </i>As a result, the detaching operation of the absorber holder <b>32</b> having the ink absorber <b>31</b> can be performed easily with respect to the platen <b>203</b>. Further, since the absorber holder <b>32</b> has the projections <b>32</b><i>e </i>on the both side faces thereof, the positioning of the absorber holder <b>32</b> having the ink absorber <b>31</b> can be performed reliably with respect to the platen <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, the ink absorber <b>31</b> includes the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>which introduces received ink downward. Since the recess <b>203</b><i>a </i>is provided with the through hole <b>32</b><i>c </i>through which the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>can extend downward, a member for reserving ink flowing downward from the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>can be formed beneath the ink absorber <b>31</b>. Thus, the limit value of an amount of ink capable of being absorbed into the ink absorber can be increased. Further, in the platen <b>203</b>, the bottom face <b>203</b><i>aa </i>of each of the recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>is sloped toward the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b, </i>and also the bottom faces <b>32</b><i>f </i>of the absorber holder <b>32</b> respectively opposing to the bottom faces <b>203</b><i>aa </i>of the recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>are inclined. Thus, almost all ink absorbed into the ink absorber <b>31</b> can be introduced to the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The above advantageous effect can be attained in a case where at least one of the bottom face <b>203</b><i>aa </i>of each of the recesses <b>203</b><i>a </i>and the bottom faces <b>32</b><i>f </i>of the absorber holder <b>32</b> is sloped toward the ink leading portion <b>31</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although the explanation is made as to the ink jet printer as an example of the liquid ejecting apparatus, the invention can also be applied to a facsimile apparatus, a copying apparatus etc. Further, the invention can be applied not only to the printing apparatus but also to an apparatus provided with a color material ejecting head used for manufacturing color filters for liquid crystal displays etc., an electrode material (conductive paste) ejecting head used for forming the electrodes of organic EL displays or field emission displays (FED) etc., a bio-organic material ejecting head used for manufacturing biochips, a sample ejecting head as an accurate pipette, and so on as the liquid ejection apparatus which ejects liquid from a liquid ejecting head toward a target medium thereby to land the liquid onto the target medium.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although only some exemplary embodiments of the invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciated that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention.</p>
