<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a present messenger, and more particularly, to a present messenger service system and method of operating the same, when a customer proposes to receive a product as a present, which enables to transfer an advertisement of the proposed product and a message of the customer to a proposed person.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a present messenger service means that, when a customer wants to receive a present on a special memorial day, a proposed person(hereinafter called “present provider”) is provided with a corresponding request message as well as a provision of the product is accomplished as soon as the present provider receives the message.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows schematically the above-mentioned system established to carry out the present messenger service.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional present messenger system mainly includes a customer PC <b>10</b> owned by a customer requesting a present and a network <b>30</b> owned by a present messenger service provider <b>30</b> informing a present provider PC <b>20</b> of the product requested by the customer and its information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this case, the network of the present messenger service provider is constructed with a web server <b>31</b> for guiding the corresponding site and a mail server <b>32</b> transferring the contents of the present requested by the customer PC <b>10</b> to the present provider PC <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">And, a mail carried by the mail server <b>32</b> provides information of a reply of the present provider by a returning mail.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The operation procedures of the service managed by the above-established present messenger service provider is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic flow chart of the operation procedures of the system according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. And, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C</figref> illustrate constructions of web pages during the operation of a general present messenger service.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, after having accessed to a corresponding web site managed by a present messenger service provider through the customer PC <b>10</b>, a customer searches various products advertised by a web page of the web site (S<b>1</b>). For instance, the customer enables to select a product wanted by himself by searching product groups “a” classified by functions of electronic products respectively and product sub-directories “b” belonging to the respective product groups “a”.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the customer enables to purchase the selected product by himself or select a present messenger service to receive the present for commemorating an anniversary or a special day. If the present messenger service is selected, various input blanks, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, are displayed on a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this case, the customer inputs the required information to the corresponding input blanks such as “name of a message receiver”, “e-mail address of the message receiver”, “e-mail address of a message sender”, “transfer message” and the like (S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this case, the “receiver” is a present provider to whom the customer wants to request the present.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">And, the customer selects a transmission after having inputted to the input blank of the “transfer message” with his home address, whereby the message containing the above information is transferred to a mailbox of the present provider (S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Then, the present provider buys the product by paying a purchase price of the corresponding present provided that he agrees to the provision of the requested present by ascertaining the transmitted mail (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Finally, the purchased product is delivered to the customer's address by the present messenger service provider (S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this case, the cost of the product to be presented is paid by the present provider through a payment method such as a credit card, automatic account transaction or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unfortunately, the operation method of the present messenger service, which is constructed with e-mails simply, according to the related art needs to have the present provider check his mail at all times so as to bring out the result.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Specifically, delivery date becomes overdue if the present provider fails to check his mails on and off. Therefore, various complain is made by the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, the present messenger service according to the related art provides only the present provider with the information, thereby failing to gain special advertisement effects.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, even though the present provider receives the message through the above-mentioned service, when agreeing to and carrying out the present request, he has to select the corresponding product by gaining access to the corresponding site first as well as make a delivery order later. Thus, the related art causes inconvenience to the present provider.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a schematic construction of a present messenger service system according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a present messenger service system according to a first embodiment of the present invention is constructed with a customer PC <b>10</b> enabling to gain access to internet, a present provider PC <b>20</b> of a present provider designated by a customer, and a network <b>310</b> established between the customer PC <b>10</b> and the present provider PC <b>20</b> and owned by a present messenger service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The network <b>310</b> of the present messenger service provider is constructed with a web server <b>311</b> for managing a web site, an information storage DB (data base) <b>312</b> in which information of various products is stored, a message transfer server <b>313</b> transferring a message to the present provider and the customer in connection with the web server <b>311</b>, and a temporary message storage DB <b>314</b> enabling to store a message temporarily in connection with the message transfer server <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this case, the web server <b>311</b>, which is connected with the information storage DB <b>312</b>, displays the information of the various products stored in the DB <b>312</b>. And, a proposal program, which provides a conversation box enabling to select whether the customer purchases the product directly or wants to receive the product as a present when the customer selects the product, is established in the web server <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">And, the message transfer server <b>313</b>, when a power of the present provider PC <b>20</b> is on, verifies this selection of the customer so as to support a pushing technique for transferring the message sent by the web server <b>311</b> to the present provider PC <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Moreover, when the power of the present provider PC <b>20</b> is off, the temporary message storage DB <b>314</b> stores the message until the power of the PC <b>20</b> becomes on.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this case, the forgoing message transfer server <b>313</b> and the temporary message storage DB <b>314</b> are established on the network <b>310</b> of the present messenger service provider as well as constructed in a manner that the transfer of the corresponding message is possible through an additional messenger provider by establishing the DB on the additional messenger provider.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Besides, the temporary message storage DB <b>314</b> may be replaced by a predetermined memory of the message transfer server <b>313</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Namely, the present messenger service system according to the first embodiment of the present invention proposes that instant verification is possible through a messenger service when the present provider PC is connected to internet without verifying every e-mail for a present request transferred to the present provider.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a schematic flow chart of the operation procedures of the system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which the operation procedures of the above-described present messenger service system is explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in order to operate the present messenger service system, a customer should firstly gain access to the web server <b>311</b> constructing the present messenger service system using the customer PC <b>10</b>. Once the customer PC <b>10</b> is linked to the present messenger service system, the web server <b>311</b> provides the customer PC <b>10</b> with information of various products through web pages. Under this circumstance, the customer searches the displayed respective products and then selects the product to be purchased (S<b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this case, the customer selects ‘a direct purchase’ provided that the selected product is to be bought directly or ‘a present messenger service’ if the corresponding product is chosen to be given to the customer himself as a birthday present for commemorating a special day (S<b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is preferable that selection buttons and the like are displayed on a web page which is being searched in the present messenger service. Instead, it is also possible that execution of the present messenger service is carried out automatically when the product is selected by the customer on the web page which is established for the present messenger service.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the present messenger service is selected through this procedure, the customer inputs the required information in the respective input blanks of a conversation box displayed on the web page (S<b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">This conversation box is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the matters written on the respective input blanks includes a name of a present provider, a messenger service provider for which the present provider subscribes and a corresponding identification code (ID, etc.) thereof, a name of the present provider or customer, a transfer message and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Besides, the input blanks further includes a blank for inputting information of a delivery place of the customer. The delivery place information includes an address where the customer wishes to receive the present and a telephone number of customer. The delivery place information becomes the major information for the present delivery by the present messenger service provider when the present provider agrees to. In this case, it is preferable that the delivery place information is included in the message transferred to the present provider. Thus, the present provider enables to carry out the delivery without asking the address of the delivery place when providing the customer requesting the present with the present.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Meanwhile, it is preferable that the delivery place information is prepared in advance when the customer becomes a member of the present messenger service provider. In this case, the delivery place information is displayed in the conversation box with input blanks when the customer selects ‘a present messenger service’. Thus, the customer enables to correct the delivery place information at need.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Then, the message is transferred to the message transfer server <b>313</b> through the web server <b>311</b> if the customer selects ‘a message transmission’.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this case, the message transfer server <b>313</b> connected with the temporary message storage DB <b>314</b> verifies the corresponding identification code of the messenger service provider for which the present provider subscribes in the contents of the transferred message, and then transfers the message to the present provider PC <b>20</b> based on this procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When a power of the corresponding PC <b>20</b> due to the absence of the present provider, the message transfer server <b>313</b> stores the message in the temporary message storage DB <b>314</b> until the power of the present provider PC <b>20</b> becomes on (S<b>105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the power of the present provider PC <b>20</b> becomes on, the message transfer server <b>313</b> retransfers the message stored in the temporary message storage DB <b>314</b> to the present provider PC <b>20</b> (S<b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this case, the message transfer server <b>313</b> uses a pushing technique so as to transfer the message to the present provider PC <b>20</b> and a popup method so as to display the transferred message on a screen of the present provider PC <b>20</b>. Therefore, the present provider does not need to carry out the verification of the message. Instead, the present provider enables the message to be transferred as well as acknowledge the message.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The message transfer server <b>313</b> verifies whether the power of the present provider PC <b>20</b> is on or not by verifying that the present provider PC <b>20</b> is connected to the messenger service through internet. In this case, the message transfer server <b>313</b> does not verify the on/off state of the present provider PC <b>20</b> substantially.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Ascertaining the customer message requesting the present through the above-described procedures, the present provider selects whether to agree to the provision of the present according to the message (S<b>107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present provider, when agreeing to the provision of the present, informs the present messenger service provider of the agreement though one of e-mail return, phone conversation, visit and the like, and simultaneously, pays the cost of the corresponding present so as to make the present delivered to the customer (S<b>108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The reply through the e-mail has a great benefit of intention transfer and bill-payment rather than other methods of returning the agreement of the present provision of the present provider. Namely, the reply through the e-mail enables to reduce the inconvenience that the present provider gains access to the web page of the present messenger service provider again as well as carry out both the purchase intention and bill-payment by providing a web page having a button for selecting an intention about the agreement and an input blank for a bill payment means(for instance, a credit card number or the like) on a message image to be transferred to the present provider.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this case, the present messenger service provider, when the agreement intention is returned from the present provider, receives the payment by being linked to a network for settlement of accounts of a previously-connected banking facility.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the present provider disagrees to the present provision and sends this disagreement to the present messenger service provider, the present messenger service provider completes its operation by transferring the corresponding contents to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a schematic construction of a present messenger service system according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a network <b>320</b> of a present messenger service provider according to a second embodiment of the present invention includes a web server <b>321</b> for operating a corresponding web site, an information storage DB <b>322</b> in which information of various products is stored, a gateway server <b>323</b> in connection with the web server <b>321</b> for WAP (wireless application protocol) transmitting a message to a mobile terminal <b>210</b> of a corresponding receiver proposed by a customer.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this case, the web server <b>321</b> is connected with the information storage DB <b>322</b> and displays the information of the various products stored in the DB <b>322</b> on the customer's demand. And, a proposal program is established in the web server <b>321</b> wherein the proposal program provides a conversation box enabling the customer to select whether to purchase the product selected by himself in direct or receive the product as a present.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">And, the gateway server <b>323</b>, as known in general, converts data on internet into a form enabling to be ascertained by a mobile phone as well as is equipped with functions of sending applications helpful for a mobile phone environment, sending/receiving mails, transferring information to the mobile phone and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Namely, the present messenger service system according to the second embodiment of the present invention is constructed to solve the problem that the present provider is unable to verify a message of a present request until a power of his PC becomes on. For this purpose, the present messenger service system according to the second embodiment of the present invention proposes that the present provider enables to verify the message exactly through his mobile phone and carry out the execution of the agreement/disagreement about the present request immediately with the message verification.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Operation of the above-constructed present messenger service system is described as follows by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a schematic flow chart of the operation procedures of the system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the customer selects one of the various products provided by the web server <b>321</b> using the customer PC <b>10</b> connected to the network <b>320</b> of the service provider (S<b>111</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">And, the web server <b>321</b> proposes whether the customer purchases the corresponding product in direct or receives the product as a present from other customers (S<b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the customer selects the messenger service to receive the product as a present, the web server <b>321</b> displays a conversation box on a corresponding web page for writing down a present provider name, information (phone number) of a mobile terminal of the present provider, customer name, transfer message and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this case, it is preferable to add an item (not shown in the drawing) for inputting information of a customer's delivery place to the input blanks.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Then, the customer carries out filling out the respective input blanks for the respective items on the conversation box (S<b>113</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After the completion of the above procedure, the web server <b>321</b> transmits a message to the WAP gateway server <b>323</b> once the customer selects ‘message transmission’ (S<b>114</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">And, the WAP gateway server <b>323</b> transforms the message into a form recognized by a mobile terminal <b>210</b>. Then, the transformed message is transmitted to the mobile terminal of the present provider through a mobile phone network (S<b>115</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The present provider ascertains the message transferred through the above procedure so as to select whether to agree to the present provision in accordance with the message (S<b>116</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">When the present provider agrees to the present provision, the present messenger service provider is informed of such contents (S<b>117</b>). A reply of the agreement of the present provision is carried out in a manner that the present provider communicates with the present messenger service provider by returning the phone number of the present messenger service provider included in the corresponding message.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Then, the present provider pays the cost of the present which is already appropriated for the corresponding present with the present messenger service provider, whereby the delivery of the corresponding present to the customer having requested the present is accomplished (S<b>118</b>). In this case, the intention of the consent to the present provision and settlement of accounts are carried out simultaneously in a manner that the present provider informs the present messenger service provider of a payment method and means. Later, the present messenger service provider is paid through a network for settlement of accounts of a banking facility.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a schematic flow chart of the operation procedures of the system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the customer selects one of the various products provided by the web server <b>331</b> using the customer PC <b>10</b> connected to the network <b>330</b> of the present messenger service provider (S<b>121</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">And, the web server <b>331</b> of the present messenger service network proposes whether the customer purchases the corresponding product in direct or receives the product as a present from other customers (S<b>122</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">When the customer selects the messenger service to receive the product as a present, the web server <b>331</b> displays a conversation box on a corresponding web page for writing down a present provider name, information (address, phone number, identification address of the web-TV, etc.) of the present provider, customer name, transfer message and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In this case, it is also preferable to add an item for inputting information of a customer's delivery place to the input blanks. Thus, the present provider enables to provide the customer requesting the present with the present in direct by having the information of the delivery place included in the message transferred to the present provider.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Then, the customer carries out filling out the respective input blanks for the respective items on the conversation box. After the completion of filling out the respective input blanks, the web server <b>331</b> transmits the message to the relay server <b>333</b> once the customer selects ‘message transmission’ (S<b>123</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In this case, based on the information about the present provider in the contents of the message, the relay server <b>333</b> recognizes a TCP/IP address of the set-top box <b>222</b> in the web-TV <b>221</b> of the present provider (S<b>124</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Then, the relay server <b>333</b> transfers the message to the corresponding web-TV <b>221</b> through the set-top box <b>222</b> of the recognized address (S<b>125</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">When a power of the web-TV is off during the message transmission, the message transferred from the web-server <b>331</b> to the relay server <b>333</b> is temporarily stored in the temporary message storage DB <b>334</b> (S<b>126</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">At the same time, the relay server <b>333</b> keeps on confirming that the power of the web-TV <b>221</b> of the present provider is on.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In this case, the relay server <b>333</b> recognizes the ‘on/off’ state of the web-TV power by carrying out bi-directional communication with the set-top box <b>222</b> of the web-TV.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Namely, the state of the web-TV connected with the set-top box <b>222</b> is easily apprehended in a manner that the relay server <b>333</b> carries out mutual communication continuously with the set-top box by being connected with the set-top box <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">When the power of the web-TV <b>221</b> is on by the above procedure, the relay server <b>333</b> transfers the message stored in the temporary message storage DB <b>334</b> to the web-TV <b>221</b> of the present provider (S<b>127</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Then, the present provider ascertains the message transferred through the above procedure so as to select whether to agree to the present provision in accordance with the message (S<b>128</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">When the present provider agrees to the present provision, the present messenger service provider is informed of such contents as soon as the delivery of the corresponding present to the customer having requested the present is carried out by having the cost of the corresponding present paid by the present provider (Sl<b>29</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Preferably, a reply of the agreement of the present provision is carried out in a manner that the process of transferring the message to the web-TV <b>221</b> is carried out reversely. Otherwise, the reply may be carried out by communication, e-mail, direct visit or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In this case, a reply method of the agreement of the present provision is carried out by using the web-TV is more excellent in carrying the intention and settlement of accounts than any other methods. Namely, both the purchase intention and bill-settlement are carried out by providing a message image received by the present provider with a button for selecting an intention about the agreement and together with an input blank for a bill payment means (for instance, a credit card number or the like) on the message image. And, the present provider enables to propose his intention of agreement, a method of settlement of accounts and means to the present messenger service provider on real-time by controlling a touch-screen or remote controller. Therefore, it is able to reduce the inconvenience that the present provider makes use off another communication means or gains access to the web page of the present messenger service provider again in order to carry out the above procedure as well as carry out the settlement of accounts for the cost simultaneously with the purchase intention.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In this case, the present messenger service provider, when the agreement intention is returned from the present provider, is paid by being linked to the network for settlement of accounts of the previously-connected banking facility.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">If the present provider disagrees to the present provision and sends this disagreement to the present messenger service provider, the present messenger service provider completes its operation by transferring the corresponding contents to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Besides, The forgoing embodiments are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present messenger service system of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Namely, the message transfer of the present invention may be carried out by the e-mail of the related art. And, the message transfer is accomplished more reliably by, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, combining all the above-described embodiments of the present invention together so as to carry out the service.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It is also easily understood that the customer requesting the present enables to carry out the present request using a mobile terminal or a web-TV as shown in the respective embodiments of the present invention without gaining access to the web-server of the present messenger service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The present provider enables to receive the message of the customer requesting the present since the present messenger service is carried out not only by the e-mail in the related art but also by various communication means on real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Accordingly, the present invention enables the message to be transferred stably and improves the credibility of the customer by ascertaining the message through various communication means without having the present provider check his mail.</p>
