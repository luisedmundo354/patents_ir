<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A switching power supply circuit includes a plurality of switching converters, each including a partial resonance voltage circuit combined with a current resonance type switching converter using a half-bridge connection system. For changeover control, a rectification circuit serves as a voltage doubler rectification circuit at an AC voltage less than or equal to 150V, but serves as a full-wave rectification circuit at an AC voltage greater than or equal to 150V. The voltage output of the converters is fed back to a rectification current path by a power factor improving transformer, the rectification current being interrupted by means of a rectification diode to expand the conduction angle of the AC input current. A DC switch circuit in the rectification current path is switched between on and off conditions in response to the input of a predetermined starting signal to control the starting order of the secondary side DC output voltage.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a switching power supply circuit including a circuit for the power factor improvement, and a plasma display apparatus which incorporates the switching power supply circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, since switching elements which can withstand comparatively high current and voltage of a high frequency have been developed, most of power supply circuits which rectify commercial power supply to obtain a desired DC voltage are formed as power supply circuits of the switching type.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A switching power supply circuit reduces the size of transformers and other devices by using a high switching frequency and is used as a high-power DC-DC converter and as a power supply for various kinds of electronic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Incidentally, generally if commercial power supply is rectified, then since current flowing through a smoothing circuit is distorted in waveform, there is a problem that the power factor indicative of the utilization efficiency of power supply is damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, a countermeasure for suppressing harmonics generated by current of a distorted waveform is required.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a method which incorporates a so-called active filter wherein a step-up type converter of the PWM control type is provided in a rectification circuit system to make the power factor approach 1 (refer to, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 6-327246 (FIG. 11)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a basic configuration of such an active filter as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a bridge rectification circuit Di is connected to a commercial AC power supply AC. An output capacitor Cout is connected in parallel to positive/negative lines of the bridge rectification circuit Di. A rectification output of the bridge rectification circuit Di is supplied to the output capacitor Cout, and consequently, a DC voltage Vout is obtained as a voltage across the output capacitor Cout. The DC voltage Vout is supplied as an input voltage to a load <b>10</b> such as, for example, a DC-DC converter at the following stage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a configuration for the power factor improvement, an inductor L, a diode D of the high speed recovery type, a resistor Ri, a switching element Q and a multiplier <b>11</b> are provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inductor L and the diode D are inserted in series between the positive output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di and the positive electrode terminal of the output capacitor Cout.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The resistor Ri is inserted between the negative output terminal (primary side ground) of the bridge rectification circuit Di and the negative terminal of the output capacitor Cout.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, in this instance, a MOS-FET is selectively used for the switching element Q, and the switching element Q is inserted between a node between the inductor L and the diode D and the primary side ground as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A current detection line LI and an waveform input line Lw are connected as a feedforward circuit to the multiplier <b>11</b>, and a voltage detection line LV is connected as a feedback circuit to the multiplier <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The multiplier <b>11</b> detects the level of rectification current flowing to the negative output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di which is inputted from the current detection line LI.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, the multiplier <b>11</b> detects a rectification voltage waveform at the positive output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di inputted from the waveform input line Lw. This corresponds to the fact that a waveform of the commercial AC power supply AC (AC input voltage) is detected as an absolute value.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the multiplier <b>11</b> detects a variation difference of the DC voltage Vout of the output capacitor Cout inputted from the voltage detection line LV. In other words, the multiplier <b>11</b> detects a variation difference of the DC input voltage to be inputted to the load <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Then, a drive signal for driving the switching element Q is outputted from the multiplier <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Rectification current which flows to the negative output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di is inputted from the current detection line LI to the multiplier <b>11</b>. The multiplier <b>11</b> detects the rectification current level inputted from the current detection line LI. Further, the multiplier <b>11</b> detects a variation difference of the DC voltage Vout (DC input voltage) of the output capacitor Cout inputted from the voltage detection line LV. Furthermore, the multiplier <b>11</b> detects the rectification voltage waveform at the positive output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di inputted from the waveform input line Lw.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This corresponds to the fact that the waveform of the commercial AC power supply AC (AC input voltage) is detected as an absolute value.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The multiplier <b>11</b> first multiplies the rectification current level detected from the current detection line LI in such a manner as described above by the variation difference of the DC input voltage detected from the voltage detection line LV. Then the multiplier <b>11</b> produces a current instruction value of a waveform same as that of an AC input voltage VAC from a result of the multiplication and the waveform of the AC input voltage detected from the waveform input line Lw.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, the multiplier <b>11</b> compares the current instruction value described above and an actual AC input current level (detected based on the input from the current detection line LI) with each other and performs PWM control with regard to the PWM signal in response to the difference to produce a drive signal based on the PWM signal. The switching element Q is switching driven with the drive signal. As a result, the AC input current is controlled so as to have a waveform same as that of the AC input voltage, and the power factor is improved so that it approaches almost 1. Further, in this instance, since the current instruction value produced by the multiplier <b>11</b> is controlled so that the amplitude thereof may vary in response to the variation difference of the DC input voltage (Vout), also the variation of the DC input voltage (Vout) is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates the input voltage Vin and the input current Iin inputted to the active filter circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The input voltage Vin corresponds to a voltage waveform as a rectification output of the bridge rectification circuit Di, and the input current Iin corresponds to a current waveform as a rectification output of the bridge rectification circuit Di. Here, although the waveform of the input current Iin has a conduction angle equal to that of the rectification output voltage (voltage Vin) of the bridge rectification circuit Di, this indicates that also the waveform of the AC input current flowing from the commercial AC power supply AC to the bridge rectification circuit Di has a conduction angle equal to that of the current Iin. In other words, a power factor proximate to 1 is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates a variation of energy (power) Pchg which is inputted to and outputted from the output capacitor Cout. The output capacitor Cout accumulates energy when the input voltage Vin is high but emits energy when the input voltage Vin is low thereby to keep the flow of the output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>c</i>) illustrates a waveform of charge/discharge current Ichg to/from the output capacitor Cout. The charge/discharge current Ichg is current which flows corresponding to accumulation/emission operation of the energy Pchg into/from the output capacitor Cout as can be recognized from the fact that the charge/discharge current Ichg has a phase same as that of the waveform of the input/output energy Pchg of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Different from the input voltage Vin, the charge/discharge current Ichg has a waveform substantially same as that of a second order harmonic wave of the AC line voltage (commercial AC power supply AC). A ripple voltage Vdc is generated on the second order harmonic wave component of the AC line voltage as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>d</i>) by a flow of energy to and from the output capacitor Cout. The ripple voltage Vdc has a phase difference of 90° from the charge/discharge current Ichg illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>c</i>) in order to conserve invalid energy. The rating of the output capacitor Cout is determined taking it into consideration that ripple current of the second order harmonic wave and high frequency ripple current from a boost converter switch for modulating the ripple current are processed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an example of a configuration of an active filter which includes the circuit configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> as a basic configuration and further includes a basic control circuit system. It is to be noted that like elements to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are denoted by like reference characters and description thereof is omitted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A switching pre-regulator <b>17</b> is provided between the positive output terminal of a bridge rectification circuit Di and the positive terminal of an output capacitor Cout. The switching pre-regulator <b>17</b> is a block formed from the switching element Q, inductor L, diode D and so forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, the control circuit system including a multiplier <b>11</b> further includes a voltage error amplifier <b>12</b>, a divider <b>13</b> and a squarer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The voltage error amplifier <b>12</b> divides a DC voltage Vout of the output capacitor Cout by means of a voltage dividing resistors Rvo-Rvd and inputs the divided voltage to the non-negated input of an operational amplifier <b>15</b>.

The operational amplifier <b>15</b> amplifies a voltage of a level corresponding to an error of the divided DC voltage Vout from the reference voltage Vref with an amplification factor determined from a feedback resistor Rv<b>1</b> and a capacitor Cv<b>1</b> and outputs a resulting voltage as an error output voltage Vvea to the divider <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, a so-called feedforward voltage Vff is inputted to the squarer <b>14</b>. The feedforward voltage Vff is an output (average input voltage) obtained by averaging the input-voltage Vin by means of an averaging circuit <b>16</b> (Rf<b>11</b>, Rf<b>12</b>, Rf<b>13</b>, Cf<b>11</b>, Cf<b>12</b>).

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In short, a voltage loop is formed from a system of the squarer <b>14</b>, divider <b>13</b> and multiplier <b>11</b>.

The multiplier <b>11</b> multiplies the inputs to produce and output a current programming signal (multiplier output signal) Imo. This corresponds to the current instruction value described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The output voltage Vout is controlled by varying the average amplitude of the current programming signal.

Therefore, a plurality of switching elements are connected in parallel in such a manner as described above so that the peak level of switching current flow to each of the switching devices is suppressed. Consequently, the reliability of the active filter circuit <b>8</b> is enhanced.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0098">Meanwhile, the choke coils L<b>11</b> and L<b>12</b> of the step-down type converters employ a ferrite core of EE-25.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0099">The power supply circuit provided in the plasma display apparatus outputs a plurality of secondary side DC output voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b> to Eo<b>5</b> individually corresponding to the different load conditions as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Further, particularly in the plasma display apparatus, for the convenience of the circuit configuration, when the power supply is activated to start the DC input voltage (rectification smoothed voltage Ei (375 V)), it is necessary for the secondary side DC output voltages to be started in a predetermined order.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100">More particularly, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo which is the logic power supply is started up first, and then the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> which is the maintaining power supply and the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> which is the data power supply are successively started.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">Thus, in order to obtain such a starting order of the secondary side DC output voltages as described above, the microcomputer outputs the starting voltages Vt<b>1</b>, Vt<b>2</b> and Vt<b>3</b> to the starting terminals Vt of the control ICs <b>2</b> of the converter sections (<b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>). Control operation of the starting up order of the secondary side DC output voltages by the starting voltages Vt<b>1</b>, Vt<b>2</b> and Vt<b>3</b> is illustrated in a timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">Here, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has a configuration of a so-called main power supply, and no standby power supply is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Since the microcomputer is supplied with the standby power supply, even if the main power supply is not in an activated state, the microcomputer can operate.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">Then, if the main switch SW is changed over from an off state to an on state in order to activate the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> which is a main power supply, then the commercial AC power supply AC is supplied to the circuit and the rectification smoothed voltage Ei is obtained. Then, if it is detected by the microcomputer that the rectification smoothed voltage Ei rises up to a prescribed level (for example, 375 V), then the microcomputer changes over the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> from the L level to the H level and outputs the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> of the H level at a timing of time t<b>1</b>. Consequently, the control IC <b>2</b> of the first converter section <b>201</b> to which the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> is inputted starts switching driving operation at time t<b>1</b>. Then, in response to this, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo obtained on the secondary side of the first converter section <b>201</b> starts its rise from the 0 level at time t<b>1</b> and rises up to a prescribed level (5 V) at a point of time when a certain period of time elapses. Thereafter, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo maintains the stabilized state at 12 V by the constant voltage control operation by the step-down converter.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">It is to be noted that it is described for the confirmation that also the remaining secondary side DC output voltages Eo<b>1</b>, Eo<b>2</b> and Eo<b>3</b> produced by the same first converter section <b>201</b> rise at a timing substantially same as that of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">Then, the activation signal Vt<b>2</b> is set such that, at time t<b>2</b> after the secondary side DC output voltage Eo rises up-to and becomes stable at the prescribed level after the rise starts at time t<b>1</b> as described above, it is changed over from the L level to the H level and outputted as a H level signal.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0106">Consequently, the control IC of the third converter section <b>203</b> is activated at time t<b>2</b>. In response to this, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> starts its rise from the 0 level later than time t<b>2</b>, and at a point of time when a certain period of time elapses, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> is fixed at a prescribed level (200 V).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">Further, at time t<b>3</b> after the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> is placed into a stabilized state at the prescribed level as described above, the microcomputer changes over the activation signal Vt<b>3</b> from the L level to the H level. In response to this, the control IC of the second converter section <b>202</b> is activated at time t<b>3</b>, and the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> rises such that it starts its rise from the 0 level after time t<b>3</b> and is fixed at a prescribed level (70 V) at a point of time when a certain period of time elapses.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0108">In this manner, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> controls the rise time of the secondary side DC output voltage so that appropriate activation operation as a power supply circuit can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109">As can be recognized from the foregoing description, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as a related art is formed incorporating an active filter having the conventionally known configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref> as a basic configuration. Further, in the case of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, three composite resonance type converters are connected in parallel at the next stage to the active filter. Furthermore, a step-down type converter for obtaining the secondary side DC output voltages Eo and Eo<b>2</b> is provided in the composite resonance type converter of the first converter section <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">Such a configuration as described above is adopted to achieve improvement of the power factor. Further, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is ready for a so-called wide range in such a manner that it operates with the AC 100 V system and the AC 200 V system as the commercial AC power supply. Further, the circuit system for constant voltage control by the switching control method and a required number of step-down type converters provided on the secondary side are combined to achieve stabilization of the secondary side DC output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">However, the power supply circuit having the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has the following problem.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0112">The power conversion efficiency of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is given as a synthesized value of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) and the DC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηDC→DC) of the current resonance type converters (first, second and third converter sections <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>) at the succeeding stage.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0113">Here, the DC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηDC→DC) of the first, second and third converter sections <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> is approximately 95%.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0114">Meanwhile, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the active filter is 93% when the AC input voltage VAC=100 V and 95% when the AC input voltage VAC=230 V.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0115">Accordingly, the combined power conversion efficiency is, when the AC input voltage VAC=100 V,
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>93%×95%=88.3%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
and when the AC input voltage VAC=230 V,
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>95%×95%=90.2%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0116">Corresponding to this, the AC input power is 679.5 W when the AC input voltage VAC=100 V, and 665.2 W when the AC input power is 230.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0117">In short, when the AC input voltage VAC=100 V (AC 200 V system), the conversion efficiency on the active filter circuit side drops and the overall efficiency drops when compared with that when the AC input voltage VAC=230 V (AC 100 V system).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0118">Further, it is necessary to design the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> such that the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the active filter may maintain 94% to 97%, for example, within the range of AC input voltage VAC=100 V to 230 V so that it may not become lower than the above-described characteristic of the power conversion efficiency under the condition that the load power Po=600 W or more.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0119">Further, while, in the active filter circuit <b>8</b>, switching operation as a step-up type converter is performed, since the switching operation depends upon dv/di and di/dt and is hard switching operation, the generation level of noise is very high.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0120">Further, since three composite resonance type converters and two step-down type converts are provided at the next stage to the active filter, also switching noise of them is so high that it cannot be ignored. Particularly since the step-down type converters perform hard switching operation, the amount of switching noise generation is great. In contrast, although the composite resonance type converters perform soft switching operation and generates switching noise of a smaller amount than the hard switching converters, since the arrangement includes three composite resonance type converters, the overall noise amount is great as much. From them, a comparatively heavy noise suppression countermeasure is required.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0121">Then, from the necessities described, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> first includes two bridge rectification circuits Di<b>1</b> and Di<b>2</b> in the rectification circuit system for rectifying the commercial AC power supply AC.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0122">Further, it is necessary to provide a plurality of power choke coils in the active filter circuit <b>8</b>. Furthermore, with regard to a semiconductor element for switching, it is necessary to connect a plurality of switching elements (transistors, diodes or the like) in parallel and add a drive circuit so that the switching elements may be driven appropriately. Further, also it is necessary to attach a large-size heat radiating plate to the semiconductor elements.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">Furthermore, in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a line noise filter including two common mode choke coils and three across capacitors is formed for the line of the commercial AC power supply AC. In short, two or more stages of line noise filters are required.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0124">Further, the normal mode noise filter <b>4</b> formed from a choke coil LN and three filter capacitors CN is provided for the rectification output line. Furthermore, in the active filter circuit <b>8</b>, also it is necessary to provide an RC snubber circuit for the switching elements. Particularly in order to be ready for a heavy load as in the case of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the resistor which forms the RC snubber is a cement resistor and has a large size.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0125">In this manner, in an actual circuit, a countermeasure against noise based on a very large number of parts is required, and this gives right to increase of the cost and increase of the mounting area of the power supply circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0126">Furthermore, in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it is considered that three kinds of switching converters exist in a mixed manner. In particular, they are a step-up type converter in the active filter circuit <b>8</b>, a composite resonance type converter which forms the first to third converter sections <b>201</b> to <b>203</b> and a step-down type converter added to the first converter section <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0127">In this instance, while the switching frequency of the step-up converter of the active filter circuit <b>8</b> is 50 KHz, the switching frequency of the composite resonance type converters of the first to third converter sections <b>201</b> to <b>203</b> is within the range from 70 KHz to 150 KHz. Further, the step-down converter of the first converter section <b>201</b> has a switching frequency of, for example, 100 KHz.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0128">Where the switching frequencies of the switching converters are different from each other in this manner, there is a problem also that the ground potentials of the primary side and the secondary side interfere with each other and the operation of the power supply circuit is liable to be rendered unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0129">Further, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has a configuration that it includes the three converter sections <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> each in the form of a composite resonance type converter. This arises from the fact that, as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in this instance, the rising timing of the secondary side DC output voltage must be controlled at the three stages of the times t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b> and t<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0130">In short, the starting signal is outputted as a signal (activation control signal) for activating the control IC <b>2</b>. Accordingly, in order to implement a starting sequence of the secondary side DC output voltage corresponding to the times t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b> and t<b>3</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, three control ICs which are activated in response to the starting voltages Vt<b>1</b>, Vt<b>2</b> and Vt<b>3</b> are required correspondingly. Therefore, three composite resonance type converters are provided corresponding to the three control ICs <b>2</b>, and secondary side DC output voltages to be produced by the three composite resonance type converters are allocated in accordance with the order of the required starting sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0131">However, with the configuration wherein the secondary side DC output voltages are successively started in such a manner as described above, a number of control ICs corresponding to the number of starting signals are required, and accordingly, a number of converter sections corresponding to the number of starting signals are required. In short, this signifies that, in response to an increase of the number of stages of a starting sequence of secondary side DC output voltages, also it is necessary to increase the number of converter sections.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0132">This gives rise to a disadvantage that, if it is tried to cope with an increase of the number of stages of a starting sequence of secondary side DC output voltages, then the number of converter sections increases only for this, and as a result, the number of components of the converter sections beginning with a control IC, an insulating converter transformer PIT, a switching element and so forth increases exceeding a necessary number. Such increase of the number of converter sections is not preferable because it results in increase in size and weight of a power supply circuit board. Further, where the converter sections increase, also the switching loss of the primary side switching elements increases correspondingly, and this is disadvantageous also in power conversion efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0128" num="0133">Therefore, according to the present invention, taking the subject described above into consideration, a switching power supply circuit is configured in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0134">In particular, the switching power supply circuit of the present invention receives a commercial AC power supply as an input thereto to produce a rectification smoothed voltage and includes a rectification smoothing section operable in response to the level of the inputted commercial AC power supply for performing changeover between an equal voltage rectification operation of producing a rectification smoothed voltage of a level equal to that of the commercial AC power supply and a voltage doubler rectification operation of producing the rectification smoothed voltage of a level equal to twice that of the commercial AC power supply, and a plurality of switching converter sections for receiving and operating with the rectification smoothed voltage as a DC input voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0135">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections includes a switching section for receiving the DC input voltage to perform switching operation, the switching section being formed from a high side switching element and a low side switching element connected in a half-bridge connection, and a switching driving section for switching driving the switching elements.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0136">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections further includes an insulating converter transformer formed by winding at least a primary winding to which a switching output obtained by the switching operation of the switching section is supplied and a secondary winding in which an alternating voltage as a switching output obtained in the primary winding is excited.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0137">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections further includes a primary side series resonance circuit formed at least from a leakage inductance component of the primary winding of the insulating converter transformer and a capacitance of a primary side series resonance capacitor connected in series to the primary winding for making operation of the switching section that of a current resonance type, and a primary side partial voltage resonance circuit formed from a capacitance of a partial voltage resonance capacitor connected in parallel to one of the two switching elements each of which forms the half bridge connection and a leakage inductance component of the primary winding of the insulating converter transformer, voltage resonance operation of the primary side partial voltage resonance circuit being obtained only in response to each of timings at which each of the switching elements turns on and turns off.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0138">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections further includes a DC output voltage production section for receiving a secondary side AC voltage obtained by the secondary winding of the insulating converter transformer and performing rectification operation of the received secondary side AC voltage to produce a plurality of secondary side DC output voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0139">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections further includes a frequency control type fixed voltage control section for controlling the switching driving section in response to a level of a required one of the plurality of secondary side DC output voltages to vary the switching frequency of the switching section to perform fixed voltage control for the required one of the secondary side DC output voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0140">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections further includes an inductance control type fixed voltage control section provided for each of required ones of the secondary side DC output voltages which are required to be fixed voltages other than the required one of the secondary side DC output voltages which is an object of the fixed voltage control by the frequency control type fixed voltage control section, the inductance control type fixed voltage control section being configured such that a controlled winding of a control transformer in the form of a saturable reactor having a control winding and the controlled winding wound thereon is inserted in a secondary side rectification current path for producing the secondary side DC output voltage and a control current level to be supplied to the control winding is varied in response to the inputted secondary side DC output voltage level to vary the inductance of the controlled winding thereby to perform fixed voltage control for the secondary side DC output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0141">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections further includes a switch section for operating, at a timing after predetermined time elapses after a predetermined secondary side DC output voltage rises, to change over the secondary side rectification current path for producing another predetermined secondary side DC output voltage from an off state to an on state.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0142">Each of the plurality of switching converter sections further includes a power factor improving circuit for improving the power factor. The power factor improving circuit includes a power factor improving transformer formed by winding a power factor improving primary winding inserted in series in the primary side series resonance circuit and a power factor improving secondary winding inserted in a rectification current path formed as the rectification smoothing section, and a rectification element inserted in a required location of the rectification current path for performing switching operation based on an excited voltage excited in the power factor improving secondary winding by the power factor improving primary winding to interrupt the rectification current.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0143">The switching power supply circuit of the present invention having the configuration described above includes, in order to be ready for a heavy load condition, a plurality of switching converter sections which receive and operate with a rectification smoothed voltage (DC input voltage).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0144">Each of the switching converter sections has a configuration that a partial voltage resonance circuit is combined with a current resonance type converter of the half bridge connection type.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0145">Meanwhile, as regards power factor improvement, the power factor is improved by a configuration that the voltage of a switching output of a composite resonance type converter is fed back to the rectification current path by a power factor improving transformer having a loose coupling and the rectification current is interrupted by a rectification diode thereby to expand the conduction angle of the AC input current to achieve power factor improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0146">Then, in order to allow the switching power supply circuit to be ready for a wide range, changeover of the rectification operation of the rectification smoothing section for producing the rectification smoothed voltage (DC input voltage) is performed between an equal voltage rectification operation and a voltage doubler rectification operation in response to the commercial AC power supply level.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0147">Consequently, for example, if it is tried to configure a power supply circuit which includes, for example, a power factor improving circuit so as to be ready for a wide range, then there is no necessity to provide an active filter for stabilizing the DC input voltage to a switching converter.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0148">Further, while the switch section changes over the secondary side rectification current path from an off state to an on stage, this operation is an operation of raising the secondary side DC output voltage produced by the secondary side rectification current path from the state of the zero level to a prescribed level. The operation of changing over the secondary side rectification current path from an off state to an on state is performed at a timing after lapse of predetermined time after a predetermined one of the plurality of secondary side DC output voltages rises. In other words, it is possible to successively start the plurality of secondary side DC voltages while the starting timings are controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0149">From this, the present invention adopts a configuration that a switching power supply circuit ready for a wide range including a power factor improving function does not include an active filter. Consequently, the switching power supply circuit has an effect that the power conversion efficiency is improved when compared with an alternative case wherein it is tried to improve the power factor, for example, by means of an active filter.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0150">Further, the switching power supply circuit of the present invention eliminates the necessity for a large number of part elements for configuring an active filter. Further, since the current resonance type converter and the power factor improving circuit which configure the power supply circuit perform soft switching operation and the switching noise is reduced significantly, also the necessity for reinforcing a noise filter is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0151">Therefore, when compared with the related art, the number of parts is reduced significantly, and consequently, reduction in size/weight of the power supply circuit can be anticipated. Also the cost can be reduced as much.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0152">While the switching power supply circuit according to the present invention is particularly ready for a heavy load condition, since an active filter which is ready for a heavy load requires a greater number of parts, the effect of reduction in size and weight and reduction of the cost of the circuit is very effective.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0153">Furthermore, since the active filter is eliminated, the interference between the ground potentials on the primary side and the secondary side is eliminated, the ground potential is stabilized and the reliability is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0154">Further, the related art is configured, in order to implement a starting sequence prescribed for a plurality of secondary side DC output voltages, such that the control ICs (switching driving sections) of the individual switching converter sections are activated with starting signals. Therefore, the related art requires provision of a number of switching converter sections corresponding to the number of stages at which the secondary side DC output voltages are to be started, that is, the number of starting signals (activation control signals).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0155">In contrast, according to the present invention, the switching power supply circuit includes a switch section to make it possible to successively start a plurality of secondary side DC voltages while the starting timings are controlled. Consequently, the necessity for the provision of a number of switching converter sections equal to the number of stages at which the secondary side DC output voltages are to be started is eliminated, and as occasion demands, the number of switching converter sections can be reduced when compared with that of the related art. Also by this, reduction of the number of part elements and resulting reduction in size and weight as well as reduction of the cost can be anticipated, and also reduction of the switching loss can be anticipated as a result of the reduction of the number of switching converter sections.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of an internal configuration of a plasma display apparatus configured incorporating a switch power supply circuit as an embodiment of the present invention in connection with a relationship between a power supply section and a functional circuit section.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0169">From the point of view of a relationship between the power supply section and the functional circuit section, the plasma display apparatus <b>10</b> as an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be considered to be composed of a switching power supply circuit <b>11</b>, a plasma display panel section <b>12</b> and a television reception function section <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0170">The switching power supply circuit <b>11</b> receives a commercial AC power supply AC as an input thereto as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to perform switching operation in such a manner as hereinafter described to output DC voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b>, Eo<b>2</b>, Eo<b>3</b>, Eo<b>4</b> and Eo<b>5</b> as operating power supplies for the plasma display panel section <b>12</b> and the television reception function section <b>13</b> in accordance with predetermined load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0171">Incidentally, the switching power supply circuit <b>11</b> corresponds to a switching power supply circuit as the present embodiment hereinafter described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, and the DC power supply voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b>, Eo<b>2</b>, Eo<b>3</b>, Eo<b>4</b> and Eo<b>5</b> are obtained as secondary side DC output voltages on the secondary side of the switching power supply circuit of the embodiment. Accordingly, the block configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a configuration common to first and second embodiments hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0172">The plasma display panel section <b>12</b> is a block which includes a display device as a plasma display device and displays an image.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0173">As a principle of display of a plasma display device, for example, gas is enclosed in a space formed between two glass substrates disposed in an opposing relationship to each other and a voltage is applied to the gas to cause vacuum discharge. Consequently, in the space between the glass substrates, the gas is ionized into a plasma state and emits ultraviolet rays. Here, if a fluorescent material layer is formed in the space between the glass substrates, then when the ultraviolet rays are illuminated on the fluorescent material layer, visible rays of a predetermined color are emitted from the fluorescent material layer. If fluorescent materials corresponding to the three colors of R, G and B are formed as such so that the discharge light emitting phenomenon described above may be obtained for each of display cells formed, for example, in a matrix, the color image display can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0174">Further, as one of methods for driving such a plasma display apparatus as described above to display, a subfield method is known.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0175">The subfield method is a driving method wherein the light emitting period of display cells is controlled for each subfield to represent a gradation (luminance) of each display cell. Further, in order to drive the display cells to display in this manner, those display cells whose data line is to be driven to emit light every time line scanning is performed and a sustain pulse is applied within each subfield period. Thereupon, where the gradation of the display cells of R, G and B which form one pixel is controlled, not only the gradation balance of the overall screen but also color reproduction of each one pixel is performed. In short, a color image can be represented.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0176">As an example of an internal structure of the plasma display panel section <b>12</b>, it includes a display panel section on which the display cells are disposed, a data driving circuit for driving data lines in accordance with image data for performing display by the subfield method, and a sustain pulse driving circuit for applying a sustain pulse. Further, the plasma display panel section <b>12</b> includes a control section for controlling operation control thereof. The control section executes various controls regarding image display operation of the plasma display panel section <b>12</b>. For example, the control section determines what subfield pattern is to be used in accordance with image data inputted thereto and controls driving operation of the data driving circuit and the sustain pulse driving circuit based on the determined subfield pattern. Further, while luminance control called PLE (Peak Luminance Enhancement) control is executed in order to achieve enhancement of the picture quality of a display image and reduction of the power consumption in such a manner as well known in the art, also an arithmetic operation processing for the PLE control and like processes are executed by the control section.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0177">The plasma display apparatus <b>10</b> in this instance includes also functions as a television receiver which receives and displays a television broadcast. In short, the plasma display apparatus <b>10</b> has functions of selecting an object channel from among received broadcasting waves and demodulating a video signal/audio signal of the channel. The television reception function section <b>13</b> is a functional circuit section for the functions.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0178">Thus, the television reception function section <b>13</b> includes a tuner (front end) for receiving and selecting a predetermined kind of a broadcasting wave (for example, a type such as a ground wave or a satellite broadcast), a decoder for demodulating a video signal/audio signal from among the signals received and selected by the tuner, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0179">A video signal obtained by the demodulation process performed by the television reception function section <b>13</b> is converted into video signal data and inputted to the plasma display panel section <b>12</b>. Consequently, the plasma display panel section <b>12</b> performs image display of the television broadcast. Meanwhile, a demodulated audio signal is inputted to an audio signal outputting circuit system provided in the same television reception function section <b>13</b> so that it is outputted as sound, for example, from a speaker or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0180">In this instance, while the six DC power supply voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b>, Eo<b>2</b>, Eo<b>3</b>, Eo<b>4</b> and Eo<b>5</b> are obtained in such a manner as described hereinabove from the switching power supply circuit <b>11</b>, the DC voltages are utilized as power supply voltages ready for the following load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0181">First, from among the six DC power supply voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b>, Eo<b>2</b>, Eo<b>3</b>, Eo<b>4</b> and Eo<b>5</b>, the DC power supply voltages Eo, Eo<b>4</b> and Eo<b>5</b> are supplied to the plasma display panel section <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0182">Since the DC output voltage Eo is called logic power supply, it is a power supply to be supplied to an IC as a control circuit of the plasma display panel section <b>12</b> and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0183">Meanwhile, the DC power supply voltage Eo<b>4</b> is called data power supply and is a power supply to be supplied to the data line driving circuit for driving the data lines.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0184">The DC power supply voltage Eo<b>5</b> is called sustain power supply and is used as a power supply for allowing the sustain pulse described hereinabove to be outputted. In short, the DC power supply voltage Eo<b>5</b> is a power supply to be supplied for the sustain pulse driving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0185">The remaining DC power supply voltages Eo<b>1</b>, Eo<b>2</b> and Eo<b>3</b> are supplied to the television reception function section <b>13</b>. The DC power supply voltage Eo<b>1</b> is called analog IC driving power supply and is supplied as a power supply for an IC (Integrated Circuit) which includes, for example, a tuner and so forth. A television receiver in recent years is inclined to perform, for example, a demodulation processing of a received and selected signal and various video/audio signal processes by digital signal processing, and includes an IC for a digital signal processor or the like for the digital signal processing. Also the television reception function section <b>13</b> includes such a digital IC as just described, and the DC power supply voltage Eo<b>2</b> is a power supply to be supplied to the digital IC. In other words, the DC power supply voltage Eo<b>2</b> serves as a digital IC driving power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0186">The DC power supply voltage Eo<b>3</b> is called audio outputting power supply and is a power supply to be supplied to an audio outputting circuit system for outputting an audio signal.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of a configuration of a switching power supply circuit of a first embodiment of the present invention as a switching power supply circuit which can be applied to the switching power supply circuit <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> adopts a configuration which can be ready for the load power Po=600 W or more and operates with the AC 100 V system and the AC 200 V system of commercial AC power supply so that it is ready for a wide range.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0188">In particular, the plasma display apparatus <b>10</b> as the present embodiment has so-called worldwide specifications such that it can operate in both of regions of the AC 100 V system of commercial power supply such as, for example, Japan and the United States and regions of the AC 200 V system such as Europe. Further, the power specification of the entire plasma display apparatus is generally 600 W or more.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0189">In the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a line filter formed from one common mode choke coil CMC and two across capacitors CL is provided for a commercial AC power supply AC. In other words, in this instance, only one line noise filter is provided for removing common mode noise.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0190">Further, choke coils LN, LN are inserted in series individually in positive/negative lines of the commercial AC power supply AC at a stage next to the line noise filter. Two filter capacitors CN//CN connected in parallel are connected between the choke coils LN, LN and a node between a positive input terminal/negative input terminal of a bridge rectification circuit Di.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0191">A normal mode noise filter <b>4</b> is formed from the choke coils LN, LN and the filter capacitors CN//CN and suppresses normal mode noise generated in a rectification current path of the commercial AC power supply. The normal mode noise filter <b>4</b> forms part of a power factor improving circuit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0192">The power supply circuit of the present embodiment has a configuration wherein the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> formed including a rectification circuit system is connected to the commercial AC power supply AC. As shown in the figure, the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> includes the bridge rectification circuit Di, smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>, Ci<b>1</b>, Ci<b>2</b>, Ci<b>2</b>, filter capacitors CN//CN and loose coupling transformers (power factor improving transformers) VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b>. The loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b> is provided corresponding to a first converter section <b>101</b>, and the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>2</b> is provided corresponding to a second converter section <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0193">The positive input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di is connected to the positive line of the commercial AC power supply AC through a negative connection circuit of secondary windings YN<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b>. Meanwhile, the negative input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di is connected to the negative line of the commercial AC power supply AC.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0194">The positive output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di is connected to the positive side of a smoothing circuit formed from the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>, Ci<b>1</b>, Ci<b>2</b>, Ci<b>2</b>. Further, the positive output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di is connected to the primary side ground.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0195">In this instance, the smoothing circuit formed from the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>, Ci<b>1</b>, Ci<b>2</b>, Ci<b>2</b> are formed in the following manner. In particular, two series connection circuits of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b> are connected in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0196">The positive terminals of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b> which are in the parallel connection relationship are connected to the positive output terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di. Nodes between the negative terminals of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b> and the positive terminals of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>2</b>//Ci<b>2</b> are connected to the negative input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di through a relay switch S. The relay switch S is turned on/off in response to a driving state of a relay RL connected to a rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0197">The rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b> is provided to drive the relay RL to change over operation of the rectification circuit system formed in such a manner as described above between the AC 100 V system and the AC 200 V system. To this end, a DC voltage obtained by half-wave rectification of the commercial AC power supply AC by means of a diode D<b>10</b> and a capacitor C<b>10</b> is inputted as a detection voltage to a detection terminal T<b>14</b>. The DC voltage level inputted from the detection terminal T<b>14</b> exhibits a variation in accordance with the level of the commercial AC power supply AC (AC input voltage VAC). In short, the rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b> detects the level of a rectification smoothed voltage Ei to detect the level of the commercial AC power supply AC.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0198">The relay RL is connected between relay driving terminals T<b>12</b> and T<b>13</b>. It is to be noted that the relay RL controls the relay switch S on/off in accordance with the conduction state of the relay RL itself. It is to be noted here that, when the relay RL is in a conducting state, the relay switch S is on, and when the relay RL is in a non-conducting state, the relay switch S is off.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0199">Meanwhile, a terminal T<b>15</b> is a terminal for grounding the ground line of the rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b> to the primary side ground.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0200">Changeover operation of the rectification circuit system having the configuration described above is such as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0201">The rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b> compares the level of the AC input voltage VAC inputted to the detection terminal T<b>14</b> with a predetermined reference voltage. When the AC input voltage VAC is VAC=150 V or more, the voltage level inputted to the detection terminal T<b>14</b> is equal to or higher than the reference voltage, but when the AC input voltage VAC is lower than 150 V, the voltage level inputted to the detection terminal T<b>14</b> is lower than the reference voltage. In other words, the reference voltage has a level corresponding to the AC input voltage VAC=150 V.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0202">Then, the rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b> drives the relay RL such that, when the level of the inputted DC voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the relay RL is on, but when the level of the inputted DC voltage is equal to or higher than the reference voltage, the relay RL is off.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0203">Here, it is assumed that, for example, a level corresponding to the AC input voltage VAC=150 V or more is inputted corresponding to the AC 200 V system.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0204">In this instance, since the voltage level inputted to the detection terminal T<b>14</b> is higher than the reference voltage, the rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b> turns off the relay RL. In response to this, also a relay switch S<b>1</b> is turned off (open).</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0205">When the relay switch S<b>1</b> is in an off state, operation that, within both periods within which the AC input voltage VAC is positive/negative, the AC input voltage VAC is rectified by the bridge rectification circuit Di to charge rectification current into the parallel circuit of the two sets of smoothing capacitors [Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b>]//[Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b>] each connected in series. This is rectification operation by a normal full-wave rectification circuit which includes a bridge rectification circuit. Consequently, a rectification smoothed voltage Ei equal to the AC input voltage VAC is obtained as a voltage across of the smoothing circuit formed from the smoothing capacitors [Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b>]//[Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b>].</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0206">In contrast, it is assumed that a rectification smoothed voltage Ei of a level corresponding to a voltage lower than the AC input voltage VAC=150 V is generated corresponding to the AC 100 V system.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0207">In this instance, since the voltage level inputted to the detection terminal T<b>14</b> is lower than the reference voltage and the rectification circuit changeover module <b>5</b> drives the relay RL so as to be on, the relay switch S<b>1</b> is controlled so as to be on. (closed).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0208">When the relay switch S<b>1</b> is in an on state, within a period in which the AC input voltage VAC is positive, a rectification current path along which a rectification output of the bridge rectification circuit Di is used to charge only the parallel connection circuit of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b> is formed. On the other hand, within another period within which the AC input voltage VAC is negative, another rectification path by which the rectification output of the bridge rectification circuit Di is used to charge only the parallel connection circuit of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>2</b>//Ci<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0209">Since the rectification operation is performed in this manner, a level equal to the AC input voltage VAC is generated as a voltage across the parallel resonance circuit of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b> and Ci<b>2</b>//Ci<b>2</b>. Accordingly, a level equal to twice the AC input voltage VAC is obtained as a voltage across the parallel connection circuits of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b> and Ci<b>2</b>//Ci<b>2</b>. In other words, a so-called voltage doubler rectification circuit is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0210">In this manner, the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> performs voltage doubler rectification operation to produce a rectification smoothed voltage Ei equal to twice the AC input voltage VAC where the commercial AC power supply AC is the AC 100 V system, but performs equal voltage rectification operation, for example, by a full wave rectification circuit to produce a rectification smoothed voltage Ei equal to the AC input voltage VAC where the commercial AC power supply AC is the 200 V system. In other words, the rectification smoothed voltage Ei of an equal level is obtained irrespective of whether the commercial AC power supply AC is the AC 100 V system or the AC 200 V system, and this makes the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> ready for a wide range. The rectification smoothed voltage Ei is inputted as a DC input voltage to the switching converter at the next stage.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0211">It is to be noted that, if it is tried to merely perform changeover between the voltage doubler rectification operation and the full-wave rectification operation, then this is possible also with one parallel connection circuit of, for example, the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0212">The reason why two parallel connection circuits of the smoothing capacitors Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b> are connected in parallel in the present embodiment is that the power supply circuit of the present embodiment is ready for the heavy load condition of the load power Po=600 W or more. As the load condition becomes heavier, the current flowing into the capacitor which forms the smoothing circuit in the rectification circuit system increases. Therefore, where smoothing capacitors are connected in parallel as in the present embodiment, rectification current to flow to the smoothing capacitors is branched. In short, the current level flowing to one smoothing capacitor is suppressed and the burden on each smoothing capacitor is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0213">It is to be noted that power factor improving operation of the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> of the present embodiment formed including such a rectification circuit system as described above is hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0214">The circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes two switching converters which operate receiving the DC input voltage (rectification smoothed voltage Ei) obtained as a voltage across the smoothing circuit (smoothing capacitors [Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b>]//[Ci<b>1</b>-Ci<b>2</b>]) described above as an input thereto, that is, the first converter section <b>101</b> and the second converter section <b>102</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The first converter section <b>101</b> and the second converter section <b>102</b> are connected in parallel to each other to the DC input voltage (rectification smoothed voltage Ei).</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0215">Further, the first converter section <b>101</b> and the second converter section <b>102</b> individually have a configuration as a composite resonance type capacitor which includes a primary side partial voltage resonance circuit in addition to a current resonance type converter of the separately excited half bridge type. Further, the first converter section <b>101</b> and the second converter section <b>102</b> are configured also such that they include the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b>, which form the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> of the voltage feedback type to achieve power factor improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0216">Here, a configuration of the first converter section <b>101</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0217">The first converter section <b>101</b> has a basic configuration as a current resonance type converter as described hereinabove. Further, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two switching elements Q<b>1</b> (high side) and Q<b>2</b> (low side) each in the form of a MOS-FET are connected to each other by a half bridge connection as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The circuit of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> by a half bridge connection is connected in parallel to the rectification smoothed voltage Ei.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0218">Further, damper diodes DD<b>1</b> and DD<b>2</b> are connected in parallel in a direction indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> between the drain-source of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0219">A partial resonance capacitor Cp is connected in parallel between the drain-source of the switching element Q<b>2</b>. The capacitance of the partial resonance capacitor Cp and the leakage inductance L<b>1</b> of the primary winding N<b>1</b> cooperatively form a parallel resonance circuit (partial voltage resonance circuit). Then, partial voltage resonance operation wherein voltage resonance occurs only upon turning on of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0220">A control IC <b>2</b> includes an oscillation circuit for driving the current resonance type converter in a separately excited fashion, a control circuit, a protection circuit and so forth and is formed as an analog IC (Integrated Circuit) for universal use including a bipolar transistor inside therein. The control IC <b>2</b> operates with a DC voltage inputted to a power supply input terminal Vcc. In this instance, the rectification smoothed voltage Ei is inputted to the power supply input terminal Vcc through a resistor Rs.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0221">Further, the control IC <b>2</b> is grounded to the primary side ground through a ground terminal E.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0222">Further, the control IC <b>2</b> includes two drive signal output terminals VGH and VGL as terminals for outputting a drive signal (gate signal) to the switching elements.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0223">A drive signal for switching driving the high side switching element is outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGH, and another drive signal for switching driving the low side switching element is outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGL.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0224">In this instance, the drive signal outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGH is applied to the gate of the high side switching element Q<b>1</b>. Meanwhile, the drive signal outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGL is applied to the gate of the low side switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0225">Further, though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a boot strap circuit is provided as an externally provided circuit for the control IC <b>2</b>. The drive signal for the high side outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGH is level shifted by the boot strap circuit so that it has a level with which it can appropriately drive the switching element Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0226">In the control IC <b>2</b>, an oscillation signal of a required frequency is produced by an oscillation circuit therein. It is to be noted that the oscillation circuit adjusts the frequency of the oscillation signal in response to the level of a control output inputted from a control circuit <b>1</b> to a terminal Vc as hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0227">Thus, the control IC <b>2</b> makes use of the oscillation signal produced by the oscillation circuit to produce a drive signal for the high side and another drive signal for the low side. The drive signal for the high side is outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGH, and the signal for the low side is outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGL.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0228">According to the described above, the drive signal for the high side outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGH is applied to the switching element Q<b>1</b>. Consequently, a gate-source voltage VGH<b>1</b> of the switching element Q<b>1</b> is obtained with a waveform suitable for the drive signal for the high side.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0229">In short, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a period within which a pulse of a rectangular wave of the positive polarity and another period within which 0 V is generated are obtained within one switching period.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0230">Then, with the gate-source voltage VGH<b>1</b> illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the switching element Q<b>1</b> is first placed into an on state at a timing at which a rectangular wave pulse of the positive polarity is obtained within one switching period. In particular, in order for the switching element Q<b>1</b> to be placed into an on state, it is necessary for a voltage of an appropriate level equal to or higher than a gate threshold voltage (≈5 V) to be applied. Since the gate-source voltage VGH<b>1</b> as a pulse of the positive polarity described hereinabove is set so as to be 10 V, a state wherein the switching element Q<b>1</b> is on is obtained corresponding to a period within which a pulse of the positive polarity is applied. Then, when the gate-source voltage VGH<b>1</b> becomes 0 V and lower than the gate threshold voltage, the switching element Q<b>1</b> is changed over to an off state. The switching element Q<b>1</b> performs switching operation by turning on/off at such timings as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0231">On the other hand, the drive signal for the low side outputted from the drive signal output terminal VGL, is applied to the switching element Q<b>2</b>. In response to the drive signal, a gate-source voltage VGL<b>1</b> of the switching element Q<b>2</b> having a waveform shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0232">In particular, the gate-source voltage VGL<b>1</b> has a waveform same as that of the gate-source voltage VGH<b>1</b> of the switching element Q<b>1</b> shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> but has, as regards the timing, a phase difference of 180° with respect to the gate-source voltage VGH<b>1</b>. From this, the switching element Q<b>2</b> is switching driven at timings at which it is turned on/off alternatively with the switching element Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0233">According to (a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a period td is formed between a period after the switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off until the switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on and another period after the switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned off until the switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0234">The period td is dead time within which both of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are off. The period td as the dead time is formed in order to make it possible to obtain charging and discharging operations of the partial resonance capacitor Cp with certainty within a short period between the times at which the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are turned on/turned off as partial voltage resonance operation. The time length of the period td can be set, for example, by the control IC <b>2</b> side. The control IC <b>2</b> adjusts the duty ratio of the pulse width regarding the drive signals to be outputted from the drive signal output terminals VGH and VGL so that the period td of a set time length may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0235">An insulating converter transformer PIT-<b>1</b> transmits switching outputs of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> to the secondary side and has a primary winding N<b>1</b> and a secondary winding of a predetermined number of turns.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0236">The primary winding N<b>1</b> of the insulating transformer PIT-<b>1</b> in this instance is connected at one end thereof to a node (switching output point) of the source of the switching element Q<b>1</b> and the drain of the switching element Q<b>2</b> through a series connection of a primary side DC resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> and a primary winding N<b>11</b> of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0232" num="0237">Further, a primary side series resonance circuit is formed from the capacitance of the primary side DC resonance capacitor C<b>1</b> and a leakage inductance L<b>1</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT-<b>1</b> including the primary winding N<b>1</b>. Since the primary side series resonance circuit is connected to the switching output point in such a manner as described above, the switching output of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> is transmitted to the primary side series resonance circuit. The primary side series resonance circuit performs resonance operation in response to the switching output transmitted thereto. Consequently, operation of the primary side switching converter becomes that of the current resonance type.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0238">According to the description above, operation of the current resonance type by the primary side series resonance circuit (L<b>1</b>-C<b>1</b>) and partial resonance operation by the partial voltage resonance (Cp//L<b>1</b>) are obtained by the primary side switching converter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0239">In other words, the first converter section <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> adopts a configuration as a composite resonance type converter which includes a resonance circuit for making the primary side switching converter that of the resonance type in combination with another resonance circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0240">Although description with reference to the drawings is omitted, the insulating converter transformer PIT-<b>1</b> is structured such that it includes, for example, an EE type core which is formed from a combination of E type cores made of a ferrite material. Further, a wiring receiving portion of the insulating converter transformer PIT-<b>1</b> is divided into winding receiving portions for the primary side and the secondary side, and the primary winding N<b>1</b> and the secondary winding are wound on a central magnetic leg of the EE type core.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0241">In the insulating converter transformer PIT in this instance, three windings including secondary windings N<b>2</b>, N<b>2</b>A and N<b>2</b>B are wound independently each other.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0242">First, the secondary side DC output voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b> and Eo<b>2</b> are produced from the secondary winding N<b>2</b>. A circuit system for producing the secondary side DC output voltage Eo from among the secondary side DC output voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b> and Eo<b>2</b> has the following configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0243">In particular, a tap output formed on the secondary winding N<b>2</b> is grounded to the secondary side ground, and the opposite end taps are led out one by one from positions of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> at a predetermined number of turns from the center position determined as the tap output. Then, rectification diodes Do<b>1</b> and Do<b>2</b> are connected to the opposite end taps through series connections of controlled windings NR<b>1</b> and NR<b>2</b> of an orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>1</b>, respectively, and a smoothing capacitor Co is further connected to form a full-wave rectification circuit. From the full-wave rectification circuit, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo is obtained as a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0244">Here, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo is branched and inputted to a control circuit <b>7</b> for the stabilization.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0245">The orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>1</b> is configured such that a control winding Nc and the controlled windings NR<b>1</b> and NR<b>2</b> are wound on the core such that, for example, the winding direction of the controlled windings NR<b>1</b> and NR<b>2</b> is perpendicular to that of the control winding Nc. The orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>1</b> formed in this manner becomes a saturable reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0246">The control circuit <b>7</b> in this instance outputs DC current, whose level is varied in response to the level of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo, as control current. In the orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>1</b> which is a saturable reactor, the inductances of the controlled windings NR<b>1</b> and NR<b>2</b> are varied in response to a variation of the control current level. Since the controlled windings NR<b>1</b> and NR<b>2</b> are inserted in series in the rectification circuit system for the secondary side DC output voltage Eo, if the inductance of the controlled windings NR<b>1</b> and NR<b>2</b> changes, then the rectification current amount to flow into the smoothing capacitor Co changes and consequently the level of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo changes. In this manner, constant voltage control is performed by variably controlling the level of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0247">Meanwhile, the rectification circuit system for the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>1</b> is formed as a half-wave rectification circuit by connecting a controlled winding NR-rectification diode Do<b>3</b> of an orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>2</b> in series to a line led out from one end portion of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and connecting a smoothing capacitor Co<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0248">Also the rectification circuit system for the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>1</b> includes an orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>2</b> and a control circuit <b>7</b> to control the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>1</b> so as to be a constant voltage in such a manner as described.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0249">Also the rectification circuit system for the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>2</b> is formed as a half-wave rectification circuit by connecting the controlled winding NR-rectification diode Do<b>4</b> of an orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>3</b> in series to a line led out from the other end portion of the secondary winding N<b>2</b> and connecting a smoothing capacitor Co<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0250">Also the rectification circuit system for the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>2</b> includes an orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>3</b> and a control circuit <b>7</b> to control the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>2</b> so as to be a constant voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0251">Further, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>3</b> is obtained from a full-wave rectification circuit formed for the secondary winding N<b>2</b>A. The full-wave rectification circuit is formed from rectification diodes Do<b>5</b> and Do<b>6</b> and a smoothing capacitor Co<b>3</b> while the center tap of the secondary winding N<b>2</b>A is connected to the zero potential.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0252">In the full-wave rectification circuit, the controlled windings NR<b>1</b> and NR<b>2</b> of an orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>4</b> are inserted in series as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the control circuit <b>7</b> outputs control current of a level corresponding to the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>3</b> to the control winding Nc of the orthogonal control transformer PRT-<b>4</b>. In short, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>3</b> is controlled to a constant voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0253">Further, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> is obtained from a full-wave rectification circuit formed for the secondary winding N<b>2</b>B. The full-wave rectification circuit is formed from rectification diodes Do<b>7</b> and Do<b>8</b> and a smoothing capacitor Co<b>5</b> while the center tap of the secondary winding N<b>2</b>B is connected to the secondary side ground so that a DC voltage E<b>4</b> is obtained first. Further, a transistor Q<b>5</b> of a DC switch circuit <b>6</b> is inserted in series between the line of the DC voltage E<b>4</b> and a smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b>. The secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> is obtained as a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0254">Stabilization of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> is performed by a switching frequency controlling method. In short, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> is branched and inputted as a detection voltage to the control circuit <b>1</b>. The control circuit <b>1</b> outputs a voltage or current, whose level is adjusted in response to the level of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b>, as a control output to the control input terminal Vc of the control IC <b>2</b> in the first converter section <b>101</b>. The control IC <b>2</b> adjusts, for example, the frequency of the oscillation signal in response to the control output inputted to the terminal Vc to adjust the frequency of drive signals to be outputted from the drive signal output terminals VGH and VGL. Consequently, the switching frequency of the switching elements Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> is adjustably controlled. As a result, constant voltage control is performed so that the level of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> may be fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0255">The DC switch circuit (switch means) <b>6</b> is provided to control the starting timing of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> in response to a starting signal Vt<b>3</b> outputted from a microcomputer provided in an apparatus in which the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0256">The DC switch circuit <b>6</b> is formed by connecting a transistor Q<b>5</b> of a MOS-FET, a bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b>, a Zener diode DZ and resistors R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b> in such a manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In particular, the drain of the transistor Q<b>5</b> is connected to the positive terminal of the smoothing capacitor Co<b>5</b>, and the source of the transistor Q<b>5</b> is connected to the positive terminal of the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b>. The gate of the transistor Q<b>5</b> is connected to the collector of the transistor Q<b>6</b> through the resistor R<b>2</b>. Further, a parallel circuit of the resistor R<b>1</b>//Zener diode DZ is connected between the gate-drain of the transistor Q<b>5</b>. Here, the anode of the Zener diode DZ is connected to the gate side of the transistor Q<b>5</b> and the cathode of the Zener diode DZ is connected to the drain side of the transistor Q<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0257">The starting signal Vt<b>3</b> is inputted as an on/off control signal to the base of the transistor Q<b>6</b> through the resistor R<b>4</b>. Meanwhile, the resistor R<b>3</b> is inserted between the base-emitter of the bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b>. The emitter of the bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b> is connected to the secondary side ground.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0258">As hereinafter described, the starting signal Vt<b>3</b> is a signal which is changed over between the L level and the H level. Were the starting signal Vt<b>3</b> has the L level (0 level), the bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b> keeps an off state. At this time, since the voltage between the gate-source of the transistor Q<b>5</b> does not satisfy the threshold value, also the transistor Q<b>5</b> exhibits an off state. Therefore, the positive terminal of the smoothing capacitor Co<b>5</b> and the positive terminal of the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b> are not connected to each other, and consequently, charging of rectification current into the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b> is not performed. Therefore, even if the DC voltage E<b>4</b> is obtained between the opposite ends of the smoothing capacitor Co<b>5</b>, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> which is a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b> remains the 0 level.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0259">In contrast, if the starting signal Vt<b>3</b> rises to the H level until a predetermined positive level is obtained, then the transistor Q<b>6</b> is changed over to an on state and a potential difference appears between the opposite ends of the resistor R<b>2</b>. As a result, the anode of the Zener diode DZ is connected to the secondary side ground through the collector-emitter of the transistor Q<b>6</b>, and consequently, the Zener diode DZ is rendered conducting by the DC voltage E<b>4</b>. Since the Zener diode DZ conducts, a gate voltage of a level which satisfies the threshold value is applied to the gate of the transistor Q<b>5</b>, and also the transistor Q<b>5</b> is turned on. As a result, the positive terminal of the smoothing capacitor Co<b>5</b> and the positive terminal of the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b> are connected to each other, and consequently, rectification current is charged into and discharged from the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b>. Accordingly, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0260">The second converter section <b>102</b> includes switching elements Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> connected in a half bridge connection, clamp diodes DD<b>3</b> and DD<b>4</b>, a partial resonance capacitor Cp, a control IC <b>2</b>, an insulating converter transformer PIT-<b>2</b> (primary winding N<b>1</b> and secondary winding N<b>2</b>), a primary side DC resonance capacitor C<b>1</b>, and a loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>2</b>, all connected in a similar manner as in the first converter section <b>101</b>. Consequently, the primary side switching converter forms a composite resonance type converter including a current resonance type converter of the separately excited half bridge connection type and a partial voltage resonance circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0261">Further, on the secondary side of the second converter section <b>102</b>, a center tap provided for the secondary winding N<b>2</b> of the insulating converter transformer PIT-<b>2</b> is grounded to the secondary side ground, and rectification diodes Do<b>9</b> and Do<b>10</b>, a noise removing resistor R<b>5</b> and smoothing capacitors Co<b>7</b> and Co<b>8</b> are connected in such a manner as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to form a full-wave rectification circuit. Thus, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> is obtained as a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>8</b> by rectification operation of the full-wave rectification circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0262">The fixed voltage control of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> is performed by a switching frequency control method of controlling the switching frequency of the primary side switching converter as can be recognized from the fact that the second converter section <b>102</b> includes the control circuit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0263">Now, a configuration for the power factor improvement of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which is configured in such a manner as described hereinabove is described.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0264">The circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> for improving the power factor. The power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> is configured such that the voltage of a switching output of a primary side converter is fed back to a rectification circuit system which rectifies and smoothes the commercial AC power supply AC. In this instance, the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b> as means for feeding back the voltage of the switching output.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0265">An example of a structure of the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0266">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the loose coupling transformer VFT includes an EE type core including E type cores CR<b>1</b> and CR<b>2</b> made of a ferrite material and combined such that the magnetic legs thereof are opposed to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0267">The loose coupling transformer VFT further includes a bobbin B made of, for example, a resin material and formed divisionally such that a primary side winding portion and a secondary side winding portion are independent of each other. The primary winding N<b>11</b> is wound on one of the winding portions of the bobbin B while the secondary winding N<b>12</b> is wound on the other winding portion. As the bobbin B on which the primary winding and the secondary winding are wound in this manner is attached to the EE type core (CR<b>1</b>, CR<b>2</b>), the primary side winding and the secondary side winding are wound in different winding regions from each other on the central magnetic leg of the EE type core. The structure of the entire loose coupling transformer VFT is obtained in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0268">In this instance, a gap G having a required gap length is formed in the joining portion of the central magnetic leg. By the gap G, the coupling coefficient is set so that a loose coupling state of, for example, k=0.75 or less is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0269">Power factor improving operation of the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> is such as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0270">First, in order to make it possible to have the description understood easily, power factor improving operation only by the first converter section <b>101</b> side is described.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0271">In the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b> provided in the first converter section <b>101</b>, a switching output of the primary side switching converter of the first converter section <b>101</b> is transmitted to the primary winding N<b>11</b>. In response to this, an alternating voltage is excited in the secondary winding N<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0272">Here, the secondary winding N<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b> is interposed between the choke coil LN and the positive input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit Di in the positive line of the commercial AC power supply AC. In short, the secondary winding N<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b> is inserted in the rectification current path. According to the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b>, operation of feeding back the voltage of the switching output of the primary side switching converter to the rectification current path is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0273">Since the voltage of the switching output is fed back to the rectification current path in such a manner as described above, when rectification current flows to rectification diodes (Da to Dd) of the high speed recovery type which form the bridge rectification circuit Di, the rectification diodes are driven to perform switching operation by the alternating voltage excited in the secondary winding N<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b>. Consequently, the rectification current flowing through the rectification diodes is switched on and off, and consequently, the rectification current has an alternating waveform. In short, high frequency components are superposed on the rectification current flowing from AC input current IAC as a source.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0274">The high frequency components of the rectification current described above first flow in the following manner where the commercial AC power supply AC is of the 200 V type and a full-wave rectification circuit is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0275">Within a period in which the AC input voltage VAC is in the positive, the high frequency components flow along the rectification current path of the secondary winding N<b>12</b>→rectification diode Da of the bridge rectification circuit Di→smoothing capacitors [Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b>]→[Ci<b>2</b>//Ci<b>2</b>]→primary side ground→rectification diode Dd→and negative line of the commercial AC power supply AC through the positive line of the commercial AC power supply AC from the filter capacitor CN.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0276">Further, within a period in which the AC input voltage VAC is in the negative, the high frequency components flow along the rectification current path of the rectification diode Dc→smoothing capacitors [Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b>]-[Ci<b>2</b>//Ci<b>2</b>]→primary side ground→rectification diode Db→secondary winding N<b>12</b> through the negative line of the commercial AC power supply AC from the filter capacitor CN.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0277">On the other hand, the high frequency components flow in the following manner where the commercial AC power supply AC is of the 100 V type and a voltage doubler rectification circuit is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0278">Within a period in which the AC input voltage VAC is in the positive, the high frequency components flow along the rectification current path of the secondary winding N<b>12</b>→rectification diode Da of the bridge rectification circuit Di→smoothing capacitors [Ci<b>1</b>//Ci<b>1</b>]→and negative line of the commercial AC power supply AC through the positive line of the commercial AC power supply AC from the filter capacitor CN.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0279">Further, within a period in which the AC input voltage VAC is in the negative, the high frequency components flow along the rectification current path of the smoothing capacitors [Ci<b>2</b>//Ci<b>2</b>]→primary side ground→rectification diode Db→secondary winding N<b>12</b>→positive line of the commercial AC power supply AC through the negative line of the commercial AC power supply AC from the filter capacitor CN.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0280">As can be recognized from the rectification current paths described above, rectification current flows through one of the rectification diodes (Da to Dd) of the high speed recovery type within both of the periods within which the AC input voltage is in the positive/negative. In short, it can be recognized that the rectification current is switched on and off such that it is switched by the rectification diodes of the high speed recovery type. Then, since the rectification current is switched on and off in this manner, charging current into the smoothing capacitor C<b>1</b> flows also within a period in which the rectification output voltage level is lower than the level of the rectification smoothed voltage Ei.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0281">As a result, since an average waveform of the AC input current approaches the waveform of the AC input voltage, the conduction angle of the AC input current IAC is expanded. Since the conduction angle of the AC input current IAC is expanded in this manner, improvement of the power factor is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0282">Then, the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> actually includes also the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>2</b> of the second converter section <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0283">Here, the secondary winding N<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b> of the first converter section <b>101</b>. Accordingly, in the rectification current paths described above, rectification current actually flows through the parallel circuit of the secondary windings N<b>12</b>//N<b>12</b> of the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b>. Consequently, the parallel circuit of the secondary windings N<b>12</b>//N<b>12</b> is included in the rectification current path.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0284">This signifies that the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> is configured such that the voltages of the switching outputs of both of the first converter section <b>101</b> and the second converter section. <b>102</b> are fed back to the rectification current path by the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0285">In short, the present embodiment has such a configuration that a voltage is fed back to the first converter section <b>101</b> by means of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>1</b> while a voltage is fed back to the second converter section <b>102</b> by means of the loose coupling transformer VFT-<b>2</b> to achieve power factor improvement. It is to be noted that the inductance values of the primary winding N<b>11</b> and the secondary winding N<b>12</b> of each of the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b> are selected so that, for example, the power factor PF=approximately 0.8 is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0286">Further, according to the configuration of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first converter section <b>101</b> produces five secondary side DC output voltages of the secondary side DC output voltages Eo and Eo<b>1</b> to Eo<b>4</b>, and the second converter section <b>102</b> produces the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0292" num="0303">Here, the starting signals Vt<b>1</b>, Vt<b>2</b> and Vt<b>3</b> are successively changed over from the L level to the H level at timings of times t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b> and t<b>3</b> as illustrated in (a), (d) and (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, respectively. Further, prior to time t<b>1</b> at which all of the starting signals Vt<b>1</b>, Vt<b>2</b> and Vt<b>3</b> have the L level, the first converter section <b>101</b> and the second converter section <b>102</b> are in a state wherein they are not activated.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0304">For example, if the main power supply is turned on and the microcomputer recognizes that the rectification smoothed voltage Ei rises to a prescribed level, then the microcomputer changes over the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> from the L level to the H level at a predetermined timing given as time t<b>1</b> and outputs the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> of the H level as illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0305">Consequently, at time t<b>1</b>, the control IC <b>2</b> of the first converter section <b>101</b> is activated. In other words, the first converter section <b>101</b> starts activation. In response to the activation, the secondary side DC output voltages to be obtained on the secondary side of the first converter section <b>101</b> rise. In short, although the secondary side DC output voltage Eo has the 0 level prior to time t<b>1</b> as seen in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, after time t<b>1</b>, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo rises in such a manner that it increases as the charged amount of the smoothing capacitor Co increases. Then, after a prescribed level is reached, the state wherein the secondary side DC output voltage Eo is controlled fixedly to the prescribed level is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0306">It is to be noted, however, that the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> does not rise similarly as seen in (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> although the DC voltage E<b>4</b> illustrated in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> rises at time t<b>1</b>. This is because, at the timing of time t<b>1</b>, the transistor Q<b>5</b> in the DC switch circuit <b>6</b> which is controlled on/off is in an off state. As described hereinabove, the DC switch circuit <b>6</b> operates such that, when the starting signal Vt<b>3</b> which is an on/off control signal has the L level, the transistor Q<b>5</b> is controlled to an off state. When the transistor Q<b>5</b> is in an off state, rectification current is not charged into the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b>, and the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> is not produced.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0307">Then, the starting signal Vt<b>2</b> illustrated in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is changed over to the H level at time t<b>2</b> after time t<b>1</b> at which the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> changes to the H level and is outputted as a signal of the H level. It is to be noted that the timing of time t<b>2</b> is set so as to be later than a point of time at which starting of operation of circuit sections which use the secondary side DC output voltage Eo as a power supply therefor is assured, for example, because the secondary side DC output voltage Eo rises completely up to the prescribed level in response to the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> which is changed over to the H level, for example, at time t<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0308">Then, in response to the changeover of the starting signal Vt<b>2</b> to the H level, the control IC <b>2</b> of the second converter section <b>102</b> is activated. Consequently, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> rises in such a manner as seen in (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> from time t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0309">Then, at a timing of time t<b>3</b> at which a state wherein the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> has risen completely to the prescribed level and is in a fixed voltage state is obtained, the last starting signal Vt<b>3</b> is changed over to the H level as illustrated in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0310">In this instance, in response to the changeover of the starting signal Vt<b>3</b> into the H level, the transistor Q<b>5</b> of the DC switch circuit <b>6</b> is changed over into an on state. In response to the changeover, the DC voltage E<b>4</b> is charged into the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b> through the drain-source of the transistor Q<b>5</b>, and thereupon, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> rises as seen in (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0311">In this manner, the present embodiment controls the rising order of the secondary side DC output voltage upon activation of the power supply so that it may be appropriate rising order same as that in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0312">It is to be noted that, for reference, the shape and the size of the core of the transformers provided in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are given below.</p>

<p id="p-0306" num="0317">Further, a result of an experiment conducted with regard to the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0318">In the conditions of the load power Po=600 W and the AC input voltage VAC=100 V, the synthesized power conversion efficiency ηAC→DC=92.5%, and this exhibits an improvement by 3.2% from the characteristic of the power supply circuit of the related art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0319">Further, in the conditions of the load power Po=600 W and the AC input voltage VAC=230 V, the synthesized power conversion efficiency ηAC→DC=94.0%, and a result that it exhibits an improvement by 2.3% from the characteristic of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> was obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0320">Meanwhile, as a power factor characteristic, in the conditions of the load power Po=600 W and the AC input voltage VAC=100 V, the power factor PF=0.83 was obtained. Then, when the AC input voltage VAC=100 V, PF&gt;0.75 was obtained within the range of the load power Po=600 W to 25 W.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0321">Further, in the conditions of the load power Po=600 W and the AC input voltage VAC=230 V, the power factor PF=0.78 was obtained. Further, when the AC input voltage VAC=230 V, a power factor higher than a prescribed a value was obtained within the range of the load power Po=600 W to 300 W, and the harmonic distortion regulation value of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) was satisfied successfully.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0322">Where the power supply circuit of the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and configured in such a manner as described above and the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shown as a related art are compared with each other, the followings can be said.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0323">First, in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, since it is configured such that it includes the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> according to a voltage feedback type, the active filter is omitted. The active filter constructs a converter, and as can be recognized from the description given with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it actually is formed from a great number of parts including a plurality of switching elements and an IC for driving the switching elements.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0324">In contrast, the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> provided in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only adds the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b> to the rectification current path, and the loose coupling transformers VFT-<b>1</b> and VFT-<b>2</b> are part elements including a small size core of the EE-28 type as described hereinabove. Accordingly, the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> includes a considerably smaller number of parts when compared with the active filter, and also the board mounting area of the part elements decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0325">Consequently, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be produced at a much reduced cost as a power supply circuit ready for a wide range including a power factor improving function when compared with that of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Also reduction in size and weight of the circuit board can be achieved effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0326">Further, it can be recognized that, in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the active filter and the step-down type converter are omitted, and a converter which performs hard switching operation is eliminated. Here, since the present embodiment is configured such that it includes the orthogonal control transformers PRT and the control circuit <b>7</b> such that stabilization of the secondary side DC output voltages Eo, Eo<b>1</b>, Eo<b>2</b> and so forth is achieved by supply of control current such as DC current, it is possible to omit the step-down type converter.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0327">Then, since only soft switching operation is involved as operation of the first converter section <b>101</b>, the second converter section <b>102</b> and the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> which form the power supply circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the level of switching noise is reduced significantly when compared with that of the active filter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0328">Further, while the number of composite resonance type converter sections in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is 3, the number of composite resonance type converter sections in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is reduced to two including the first and second converter sections <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. Also where the number of composite resonance type converter sections is reduced in this manner, reduction in size and weight of the circuit described above is promoted. Further, since the switching operation is soft switching operation, although the switching noise is originally small in amount, if the number of composite resonance type converters decreases, also the switching noise decreases as much. Also a merit in this regard is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0329">Therefore, in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can sufficiently clear the power supply disturbance specification value if it includes one stage of a line filter formed from one common mode choke coil CMC and two across capacitors CL.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0330">Also by reduction of the number of part elements of the noise filter in this manner, reduction of the cost of the power supply circuit and reduction in size and weight of the circuit board are promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0331">Further, the total power conversion efficiency of the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is determined by the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC/DC) of the active filter at the preceding stage and the DC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηDC/DC) of the current resonance type converters at the following stage. In contrast, since the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> does not include the active filter at the preceding stage, the synthesized power conversion efficiency may be regarded as the total value of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (ηAC→DC) of the current resonance type converter. Further, it is known that, where a power factor improving circuit by the voltage feedback type is provided as in the present embodiment, the power conversion efficiency of the same is substantially equal to that of a composite resonance type converter which does not include a power factor improving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0332">Consequently, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is improved significantly in terms of the power conversion efficiency when compared with the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0333">Further, the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is configured such that the active filter circuit <b>8</b>, three converter sections <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> and two step-down type converters operate with switching frequencies different from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0334">In contrast, in the present embodiment, only the two first and second converter sections <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> perform switching operation independently each other with switching frequencies different from each other. The switching frequencies of the first and second converter sections <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are varied in response to the levels of the secondary side DC output voltages E<b>4</b> and Eo<b>5</b> within the range of, for example, 70 KHz to 150 KHz to achieve the voltage fixation.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0335">In this manner, where the number of converters which operate for switching with different switching frequencies from each other is reduced, since also the interference between the ground potentials of the primary side and the secondary side decreases as much, also the operation of the power supply circuit is further stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0336">Incidentally, the reason why the three converter sections <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are provided as composite resonance type converters in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is that, as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in this instance, the rising timings of the secondary side DC output voltages must be controlled at the three stages of times t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b> and t<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0337">In particular, if it is tried to start the secondary side DC output voltages corresponding to the starting signals Vt<b>1</b>, Vt<b>2</b> and Vt<b>3</b> which are outputted at times t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b> and t<b>3</b>, then a construction that it includes three composite resonance type converters and activation of the control IC <b>2</b> for each of the composite resonance type converters is controlled with the starting signals Vt<b>1</b>, Vt<b>2</b> and Vt<b>3</b> has been adopted heretofore.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0338">In contrast, in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the DC switch circuit <b>6</b> is provided such that the on/off state of the DC switch circuit <b>6</b> is controlled with the starting signal Vt<b>3</b> to control rising of the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b>. Consequently, the number of control ICs necessary to control the rising of the secondary side DC output voltages is reduced by one. In other words, it is possible to reduce one converter section.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0339">Where a converter section is reduced, also reduction of the number of parts as much can be anticipated. Further, also the switching loss by the switching elements which form the primary side switching converter is decreased as much.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0340"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of a configuration of a switching power supply circuit as a second embodiment. It is to be noted that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, like elements to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are denoted by like reference characters and description thereof is omitted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0341">In the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, firstly the internal configuration of the DC switch circuit (switch section) <b>6</b> provided on the first converter section <b>101</b> side is different from that in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In particular, the DC switch circuit <b>6</b> includes a time constant capacitor C<b>3</b>. The power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> in this instance is formed from, for example, an electrolytic capacitor, and is connected at the positive terminal thereof to the base of the bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b> and at the negative terminal thereof to the secondary side ground.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0342">Further, in this instance, as an on/off control signal to be inputted to the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> of the second converter section <b>102</b> is inputted in place of the starting signal Vt<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0343">In such a configuration as described above, a predetermined delay time according to the time constant of a resistor R<b>4</b> and a time constant capacitor C<b>4</b> is given to a point of time at which the transistor Q<b>6</b> is placed fully into an on state after a point of time at which inputting of an on/off control signal of a predetermined level, for example, of the positive polarity is started. Consequently, a delay according to the time constant of the resistor R<b>4</b> and the time constant capacitor C<b>4</b> is given also to a period of time until the transistor Q<b>5</b> is placed fully into an on state after the inputting of the on/off control signal is started.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0344">Further, in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, also on the secondary side of the second converter section <b>102</b>, a DC switch circuit <b>6</b>A is provided in place of the noise removing resistor R<b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Also the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>A (switch section) is formed from a transistor Q<b>7</b>, a bipolar transistor Q<b>8</b>, a Zener diode DZ, resisters R<b>8</b>, R<b>9</b>, R<b>10</b> and a time constant capacitor C<b>8</b> connected in a substantially similar manner as in the case of the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>. Accordingly, also by the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>A, a delay according to a time constant of the resistor R<b>8</b> and the time constant capacitor C<b>8</b> is given to a period of time until the transistor Q<b>7</b> is placed fully into an on state after inputting of the on/off signal is started. Then, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo produced by the first converter section <b>101</b> side is inputted as the on/off control signal to the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0345">Further, in the present power supply circuit, only the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> is outputted from the microcomputer and inputted to the starting terminal Vt of the control IC <b>2</b> of the first converter section <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0346">Control operation for successively starting the secondary side DC output voltages in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is described with reference to a timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0347">Also in this instance, when the microcomputer recognizes that the main power supply is turned on, it changes over the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> from the L level to the H level at a predetermined timing given as time t<b>1</b> as seen in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and outputs the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> of the H level. In response to the starting signal Vt<b>1</b>, also the first converter section <b>101</b> is activated at time t<b>1</b> and the secondary side DC output voltage Eo rises as illustrated in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0348">Further, corresponding to time t<b>1</b>, also the secondary side DC output voltage obtained on the secondary side of the first converter section <b>101</b> rises. However, also in this instance, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> does not rise at time t<b>1</b> as seen from (h) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The DC output voltage E<b>4</b> at the preceding stage rises at time t<b>1</b> in response to the activation of the first converter section <b>101</b> as seen in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0349">The time t<b>1</b> at which the starting signal Vt<b>1</b> changes over to the H level corresponds substantially to the point of time at which the main power supply is turned on. The activation terminal of the second converter section <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is open without having a starting signal inputted thereto. In this instance, the control IC <b>2</b> starts operation and is activated in response to the voltage upon activation inputted from the power supply input terminal Vcc.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0350">Therefore, also the second converter section <b>102</b> is activated such that it starts switching operation at a timing substantially same as the time t<b>1</b>. Then, in response to the activation of the second converter section <b>102</b>, also the DC voltage E<b>5</b> which is a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>7</b> provided on the secondary side of the second converter section <b>102</b> rises substantially at time t<b>1</b> as seen from (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. However, since, at this point of time, the transistor Q<b>7</b> of the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>A is in an off state, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> which is a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>8</b> does not rise as seen from (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0351">Here, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo is placed into a state in which it reaches a prescribed level at time t<b>1</b>A after lapse of a certain interval of time from time t<b>1</b>. In response to this, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo is inputted as an on/off control signal. In the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>A of the second converter section <b>102</b>, the base voltage of the transistor Q<b>8</b> gradually rises in such a manner as seen in (e) of. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example, at a timing of this time t<b>1</b>A. The inclination of the rise of the base voltage is determined by the time constant of a resistor R<b>8</b> and a time constant capacitor C<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0352">Then, if the base voltage of the transistor Q<b>8</b> comes to a predetermined level, for example, at time t<b>2</b>, then the transistor Q<b>8</b> is placed fully into an on state. Then, at this time, a state wherein also the transistor Q<b>7</b> is fully on is obtained, and the DC voltage E<b>5</b> illustrated in (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> which is a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>7</b> is supplied to the smoothing capacitor Co<b>8</b> through the transistor Q<b>7</b>. Consequently, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> which is a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>8</b> rises from time t<b>2</b> in such a manner as seen in (f) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0353">Then, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>5</b> rising at time t<b>2</b> in such a manner as described above is inputted as an on/off control signal to the DC switch circuit <b>6</b> of the first converter section <b>101</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0354">In response to this, the operation that the base voltage of the bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b> rises in a period of time determined by the time constant of the resistor R<b>4</b> and the time constant capacitor C<b>3</b> as seen in (g) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is obtained with the DC switch circuit <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0355">Then, if the base voltage of the bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b> comes to a predetermined level until the bipolar transistor Q<b>6</b> is placed fully into an on state, for example, at time t<b>3</b>, then a state wherein also the transistor Q<b>5</b> is fully on is obtained. As a result, the DC voltage E<b>4</b> illustrated in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is supplied to the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b> through the transistor Q<b>5</b>. Consequently, the secondary side DC output voltage Eo<b>4</b> which is a voltage across the smoothing capacitor Co<b>6</b> rises from time t<b>3</b> in such a manner as seen from (h) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0356">In this manner, also in the power supply circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, rising timings of the secondary side DC output voltages similar to those of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0357">Then, also with the power supply circuit of the present second embodiment, such effects as enhancement of the power conversion efficiency, reduction in size and weight of the circuit and enhancement of the stability by reduction of interference between the grounds as a power supply circuit having a power factor improving function are obtained from similar reasons to those of the power supply circuit of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0358">Further, reduction of the number of parts and reduction of the switching loss by reduction of converter sections can be anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0359">Here, if the configuration of the switching converter of the present invention is used as a basic configuration, then the number of converter sections can be reduced to one. This can be recognized easily if the configuration of the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is referred to. In particular, in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, after the first converter section <b>101</b> is started with the starting signal Vt<b>1</b>, the secondary side DC output voltages Eo<b>5</b> and Eo are inputted to the DC switch circuits <b>6</b> and <b>6</b>A each of which includes a time constant circuit so that the secondary side DC output voltages are started in accordance with a prescribed order as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this instance, since a starting signal is not inputted to the starting terminal Vt of the control IC <b>2</b> of the second converter section <b>102</b>, it is possible to adopt a configuration wherein also the second converter section <b>102</b> is omitted and the only one first converter section <b>101</b> produces and outputs necessary secondary side DC output voltages Eo and Eo<b>1</b> to Eo<b>6</b>. This can be achieved technically readily.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0360">However, in the present embodiment, the switching power supply circuit includes two converter sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref> and does not have a configuration which includes only one converter section taking the following matter into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0361">In particular, the power supply circuits of the presents shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref> are incorporated as the switching power supply circuit <b>11</b> of the plasma display apparatus <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As well known, the plasma display apparatus <b>10</b> can be formed, from its structure as a display device, in a considerably small size and thickness in the depthwise direction when compared with, for example, a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube). The fact that the plasma display apparatus <b>10</b> is thin in this manner is a significant merit, for example, in terms of installation and so forth of a plasma display apparatus. In short, it is considered that preferably a plasma display apparatus is formed with a thickness as reduced as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0362">From such a situation as just described, it is requested that also a power supply circuit board incorporated in a plasma display apparatus be sized and shaped so that it does not make an obstacle to reduction in thickness of the plasma display apparatus. In order to achieve this, regarding the size and the shape of the power supply circuit board, it is requested to make the height lower. However, since the insulating converter transformer PIT has a comparatively great height among parts which form the power supply circuit, the height of the power supply circuit board depends upon the height of the insulating converter transformer PIT.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0363">As described hereinabove, in the power supply circuit of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cores (bobbins) of EER-40 and EER-42 are used for the insulating converter transformers PIT-<b>1</b> and PIT-<b>2</b>, respectively, as described hereinabove. With the cores of such sizes, where they are used in a vertical posture, the height is within a range from approximately 41 mm to 46 mm, but where they are used in a horizontal posture, the height is within another range from approximately 30 mm to 35 mm. Accordingly, also the height of the power supply circuit board corresponds to the size.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0364">It is to be noted that, also with regard to the power supply circuit of the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, since the cores (bobbins) of similar sizes and shapes are used for the insulating converter transformers PIT-<b>1</b> and PIT-<b>2</b>, also the height of the power supply circuit board is substantially equal to that described above.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0365">Under present conditions, such a layout, a structure and so forth of internal parts in which such a height of the power supply circuit board as mentioned above does not make an obstacle to achievement of a thin configuration of the plasma display apparatus are used.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0366">However, if the number of converter sections is reduced to one while a total load condition (load power 600 W) equal to that of the power supply circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref> is satisfied, then also the number of insulating converter transformers PIT used is reduced to one. Consequently, power transmission from the primary side to the secondary side in accordance with the load condition of 600 W described above relies only upon the single insulating converter transformer PIT.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0367">Therefore, it is necessary to increase the core (bobbin) size of the insulating converter transformer PIT when compared with the power supply circuit of the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>6</b>. In other words, if it is tried to decrease the number of converter sections while the load condition remains equal, then it is necessary to increase the core (bobbin) size of the insulating converter transformer PIT as much. Where the number of converter sections is reduced to one while the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref> are used as a basic configuration, at the smallest, EER-49 must be selected actually.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0368">The EER-49 has a height of approximately 50 mm where it is used in a vertical posture, and has approximately 37 mm even where it is used in a horizontal posture. If they are compared with those of the EER-40 or the EER-42, then an increase of the size in a unit of centimeter is invited. This may give rise to a case wherein a plasma display apparatus is not formed with a thickness size reduced by a required amount.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0369">Therefore, in the present embodiment, the number of converter sections is not reduced to one but is set to 2. In other words, the present embodiment is configured such that only one converter section is deleted from the configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the related art which includes three converter sections, and hence the present embodiment includes two converter sections. Consequently, both of the merits of reduction of the number of parts and of the low loss by elimination of a converter section and of that reduction in thickness of the plasma display apparatus is not disturbed are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0370">In short, it can be said that the number of converters of the power supply circuit of the present embodiment should be determined depending upon the equilibrium of effects by reduction of a converter section and a required size and shape of a power supply circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0371">Further, the present invention is not limited to the configurations of the power supply circuit described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0372">For example, for the switching elements, any element other than a MOS-FET may be adopted only if it can be used in a separate excitation scheme such as an IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor). Further, also the constants of the part elements described hereinabove may be altered in accordance with actual conditions and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0373">Further, according to the present invention, a power supply circuit can be constructed including a current resonance type converter of the self-excited half-bridge connection type. In this instance, for example, a bipolar transistor can be selected for the switching elements.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0374">Furthermore, also the circuit configuration for producing secondary side DC output voltages, for example, on the secondary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT may be altered suitably.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0375">Further, also the configuration of the power factor improving circuit <b>3</b> is not limited to those disclosed as the embodiments described above, but any of circuit configurations according to the various voltage feedback systems which have been proposed by the assignee of the present invention can be adopted if it is applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0376">Further, in the power supply circuit based on the present invention, also the number of stages of switching converters need not necessarily be limited to two stages as disclosed, for example, as the embodiments as can be recognized from the foregoing description. The number of stages should be determined depending upon the equilibrium of effects provided by reduction of the number of converter sections and the required size and shape for a power supply circuit board, and may be altered suitably in accordance with, for example, the load power to be achieved, the number of required secondary side DC output voltages and so forth. Further, since the number of secondary side DC output voltages to be produced by the converter sections is not particularly limited. In addition, according to the present invention, if the configuration that the DC switch circuits <b>6</b> and <b>6</b>A (switch sections) are provided is adopted, then it is possible to reduce the number of switching converter sections, which are required to obtain an equal number of secondary side DC output voltages, when compared with that in an alternative case wherein a power supply circuit having a same load condition and a same secondary side DC output voltage number is configured based on the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0377">Furthermore, the switching power supply circuit of the present invention may be incorporated in apparatus other than plasma display apparatus. In particular, the switching power supply circuit can be incorporated in various apparatus which are required to produce a plurality of DC output voltages (secondary side DC output voltages) in accordance with a comparatively great number of different load conditions and besides required to successively start the DC output voltages successively at predetermined timings.</p>
