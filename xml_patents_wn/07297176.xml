<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a cemented carbide body for use in, e.g., twist drills, particularly useful for metal cutting operations requiring high wear resistance such as drilling in cast iron, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Drilling in metals is generally divided into two types: long hole drilling and short hole drilling. Short hole drilling is generally meant drilling to a depth of up to 3-5 times the drill diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Long hole drilling places great demands on good chip formation, lubrication, cooling and chip transport. This is achieved through specially developed drill systems with specially designed drill heads attached to a drillstring. The drill head can be of solid cemented carbide but is generally of tool steel provided with a number of inserts of cemented carbide placed in such a way that they together form the cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With short hole drilling, the demand is not as great and twist drills either of cemented carbide, tool steel or tool steel provided with cemented carbide inserts are used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A twist drill of cemented carbide is usually manufactured from a cylindrical blank which is machined to the desired shape and dimensions particularly to form cutting edges and flutes. Alternatively, the chip flutes are at least preformed during the extrusion operation. As a result of the grinding, sharp edges are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A relatively recent type of drill is a drill with an exchangeable drill tip generally made of cemented carbide and removably connected to a drill shank of tool steel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A common reason to failure of a twist drill is excessive wear in the juncture between the main cutting edge and the leading edge. Another reason to failure is, when the cutting speed is increased, plastic deformation due to high temperature in the peripheral part of the cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">EP-A-951576 discloses a cemented carbide drill consisting of a tough core surrounded by a more wear resistant cover. This type of drill is most suitable for toughness demanding drilling applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of this invention to avoid or alleviate the problems of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also an object of this invention to provide a cemented carbide body having high wear resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a specific object of the present invention to provide a metal drilling tool with increased tool life in applications requiring good wear resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a cemented carbide body of the following composition:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0013">Co: from about 10-12 wt-%,</li>

WC: as remainder.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0041">Samples were prepared by wet mixing powders of WC, Co, TiC, TaC and NbC to obtain a cemented carbide with a composition of 78.2 wt-% WC, 11.2 wt-% Co, 4.0 wt-% TiC, 2.1 wt-% TaC, 4.5 wt-% NbC and an average WC grain size of about 1 μm. The mixture was, after spray drying, isostatically pressed to cylindrical blanks which were ground to drills of 8 mm diameter. The microstructure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. After grinding the drills were coated with a layer of 4 μm TiAlN using PVD-technique.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0042">Drills from Example 1 were tested in a drilling operation for drilling through holes in cast iron SS0125. As a reference, corresponding drills of Sandvik commercial cemented carbide grade GC 1220 commonly used for drilling in cast iron.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0043">The following data were used:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0044">Cutting speed: 100 m/min</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0045">Feed: 0.25 mm/rpm</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0046">Through holes, 25 mm deep, were drilled with outer coolant.</li>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0048">Example 2 was repeated at an increased cutting speed of 175 m/min and internal cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0049">The result is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which shows the wear VBPmax as a function of number of holes drilled for the drill according to the invention (▪) and reference (♦).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0050">Examples 2 and 3 show that the composition of the present invention is between 35% and 50% better in wear resistance in both ordinary and increased cutting speeds.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0051">Samples were prepared by wet mixing powders of WC, Co, TiC, CrC and NbC to obtain a cemented carbide with a composition of 78.8 wt-% WC, 11.2 wt-% Co, 4.0 wt-% TiC, 5.5 wt-% NbC, 0.5 wt-% CrC and an average WC grain size of about 1 μm. The mixture was, after spray drying, uniaxially pressed and sintered to saw tip blanks.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 5</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0052">A circular saw blade was made of tips from Example 4. Saw tips of a commodity cemented carbide grade with the composition of 69 wt-% WC, 11 wt-% Co, 10 wt-% TiC, 8.5 wt-% TaC, 1.5 wt-% NbC and an average WC grain size of about 2.0 μm was used as reference material. All saw tip blanks were brazed onto a circular steel blade (φ 285 mm×60 tips) and ground to a width of 2.5 mm. The edge of each tip had a ground chamfer of width 0.2 mm. The tips were placed onto the saw in groups of six tips for each variant.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0053">The cutting test material was steel bar type 17Cr3, Ø 52 mm. The reference cemented carbide grade is commonly used in circular metal saws for general steel, low carbon steel and stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0054">The following data were used in the dry saw cutting test:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0055">Machine: Noritake</li>
    <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0056">Cutting speed: 800 rpm</li>
    <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0057">Feed rate: 40 mm/s</li>
    <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0058">Machinability additive: Supra 60S with a dropping speed of 1 drop/second</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0059">The saw tip performance was measured by the flank wear after 10000 passes.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Result:</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0060">The saw tips of the reference grade showed a flank wear of 0.4 mm after 10000 cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0061">The saw tips according to the invention had less than 0.15 mm of flank wear.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0062">Microchipping along the cutting edge with severe built-up edge (BUE) and heavy smearing could be observed at the edges of the reference grade.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0063">The saw tips according to the invention showed a nice wear pattern with good edge retention without micro chipping.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0064">Example 5 shows that the flank wear resistance is more than two times higher in the invented grade.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0065">The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein, however, is not to be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, since these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
