<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) element, and especially to a memory element to be used in a MRAM comprising an array of memory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A MRAM element is generally characterized by a magnetic moment vector having an orientation that can be modified by the application of an external action, especially a magnetic field. Specific information is stored in the memory element by orienting the magnetic moment vector along a selected direction and/or orientation. The memory element can keep information for a long time without requiring refreshment of the memory element in the absence of a power supply, which is a significant advantage of this type of memory. As an example, to store binary information, a memory element having a selected-magnetization axis may be provided. The magnetic moment vector is then oriented along a selected-magnetization axis in a first direction to store a first state of the information and in the opposite direction to store a second state of the information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional method for reading information stored in a MRAM element consists of detecting the resistance differences in the memory element according to the orientation of the magnetic moment vector. A conventional method for writing to a memory element involves write magnetic fields generated by running currents through metal lines external to the memory element. In unconventional fashion, it has also been provided to use the effects caused by a current sent through the actual memory element. Such effects especially are: the magnetic field created by the current, a thermal effect induced by Joule effect, or a transfer effect of the spin angular momentum of the conduction elements towards the magnetization.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the simplified diagram of a conventional magnetic memory. MRAM <b>10</b> is formed of first lines of a conductive material forming word lines <b>12</b> arranged perpendicularly to second lines of a conductive material forming bit lines <b>14</b>. Period p of the network of word lines <b>12</b> and period p′of the network of bit lines <b>14</b> generally are on the order of a few times width w of a metal track and may be different. A memory element <b>16</b> is arranged at the intersection of each word line <b>12</b> and of each bit line <b>14</b>. The write process then involves magnetic fields generated by running currents through word lines <b>12</b> and bit lines <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A realistic diagram of a magnetic memory may be more complex and involve, for example, for reading purposes, a diode or a transistor in series with each memory element with no significant influence upon the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is currently attempted to increase the density of magnetic memories, that is, to increase the number of memory elements per surface area unit. A difficulty results due to the fact that, by dipolar interaction, the magnetic moment of a considered memory element is likely to disturb the behavior of adjacent memory elements, the difficulty increases as the memory density increases. A disturbance for example translates as a degradation in the reliability of the process of information writing into the memory elements adjacent to the considered memory element, or as a degradation in the information retention time in the adjacent memory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To avoid such a disadvantage, the use of a memory element, which, in the absence of application of an external magnetic field, has a very small magnetic moment, is preferred. Such a memory element is said to be compensated. A compensated memory element has a negligible influence upon the adjacent memory elements as soon as it is moved away from the memory element by a distance greater than a small multiple of the thickness of the memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows an example of a compensated memory element, of the type of the memory element described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,906.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Memory element <b>16</b> is placed between a word line <b>12</b> and a bit line <b>14</b>, without requiring a specific assumption concerning a possible contact between memory element <b>16</b> and word line <b>12</b> and/or bit line <b>14</b>, nor concerning the presence of additional layers between memory element <b>16</b> and word line <b>12</b> and/or bit line <b>14</b>. As an example, word line <b>12</b> is placed at the top of memory element <b>16</b> and bit line <b>14</b> is placed at the base of memory element <b>16</b> and is directed according to a 90° angle with respect to word line <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Magnetic regions <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> are formed by synthetic antiferromagnet structures, also called SAF structures. More specifically, memory element <b>16</b> comprises a first magnetic region <b>18</b>, a barrier layer <b>20</b>, and a second magnetic region <b>22</b>, barrier layer <b>20</b> being sandwiched between first magnetic region <b>18</b> and second magnetic region <b>22</b>. First magnetic region <b>18</b> includes a three-layer structure which includes a separation layer <b>24</b> sandwiched between two ferromagnetic layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and which induces an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two ferromagnetic layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. Second magnetic region <b>22</b> includes a three-layer structure which comprises a separation layer <b>30</b> sandwiched between two ferromagnetic layers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and which induces an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two ferromagnetic layers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. Ferromagnetic layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> respectively have magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>which are maintained antiparallel by coupling through separation layer <b>24</b>. Similarly, ferromagnetic layers <b>32</b>,<b>34</b> respectively have magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>3</sub>, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>4 </sub>which are maintained antiparallel by coupling through separation layer <b>30</b>. Each ferromagnetic layer may be formed of several ferromagnetic layers coupled by interfacial exchange interactions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Magnetic region <b>18</b> is called a free magnetic region since {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>are free to pivot in the presence of a magnetic field applied to memory element <b>16</b>. Magnetic region <b>22</b> is called a trapped magnetic region since {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>3 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>4 </sub>are not free to pivot in the presence of a magnetic field having a moderate amplitude, magnetic moment vector {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>4 </sub>being set in a selected direction. This result is generally obtained by deposition of layer <b>34</b> on an antiferromagnetic film which has no significant influence upon the present invention. Magnetic region <b>22</b> can thus be used as a reference magnetic region.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Magnetic regions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> have substantially parallel selected-magnetization axes along which magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>3</sub>, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>4 </sub>orient in selected fashion. The storage of information in a memory element <b>16</b> is obtained by orienting {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>in parallel with or antiparallel to {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>3</sub>. The reading of the information stored in the memory element is performed by having a current run through the memory element and by detecting the resistance differences in memory element <b>16</b> according to the orientation of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>. Indeed, the resistance depends on the relative orientation of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>with respect to {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To avoid magnetic moments of memory element <b>16</b> from disturbing the adjacent memory elements, magnetic regions <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> are compensated, that is, the materials and/or the volumes of ferromagnetic regions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are selected so that the resulting magnetic moment {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot </sub>of free magnetic region <b>18</b>, equal to {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>+{right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>and the resulting magnetic moment vector of trapped magnetic region <b>22</b>, equal to {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>3</sub>+{right arrow over (μ)}<sub>4</sub>, are substantially equal to the zero vector. This then enables increasing the density of magnetic memory <b>10</b> with respect to a simple memory element, the free magnetic region of which would be formed of a single ferromagnetic layer, as is the case in a conventional memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, in a compensated memory element, the minimizing or the optimizing of the interaction, mainly of dipolar origin, between magnetic regions <b>18</b> and <b>22</b> must be taken into account in the structure details of these regions. For simplification, this point will not be considered in the following description, while having verified that it has no significant influence upon the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conventionally, the writing of information into memory element <b>16</b> is obtained by the generation of magnetic fields adapted to orient {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>in a selected direction and way. Since {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>are maintained antiparallel by the antiferromagnetic interaction through layer <b>24</b>, it is equivalent to control the orientation of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>or that of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>. The write magnetic fields are created by the flowing of currents in word line <b>12</b> and bit line <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The definition of magnetic fields for the writing of a single memory element <b>16</b> is a delicate process. Indeed, it must be avoided for the write magnetic fields resulting from the flowing of currents in a word line <b>12</b> and a bit line <b>14</b> to cause a writing into other memory elements <b>16</b>, for example, the memory elements connected to the same word line or to the same bit line, and the memory elements neighboring the addressed memory element. The obtaining of proper write magnetic fields is generally more difficult still when the free magnetic region of the memory element has a compensated or almost compensated structure since the modification of the orientation of the magnetic moment vectors of the memory elements tends to require more intense magnetic fields, in particular to overcome the interaction between the layers of the free magnetic region. Further, when a magnetic field is applied to the memory element, it is difficult to ensure that resulting moment {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot </sub>of free magnetic region <b>18</b> maintains during the write process a sufficiently low amplitude to avoid disturbing the adjacent memory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To achieve very high integration densities, two other contradictory phenomena must be controlled. The first phenomena is that when the volume of free magnetic region <b>18</b> decreases, the preservation of a sufficient information retention time requires increasing the total magnetic anisotropy of the sample, which, in general, increases the amplitude of the magnetic fields required for the write process. The second phenomenon is due to the fact that the maximum admissible current density in a conductive line is limited by physical phenomena (Joule effect, electromigration). The maximum current that can be injected for a write process and the write magnetic field, which is proportional thereto thus decrease along with the conductive line cross-section as the memory density is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,906 describes a specific compensated or almost compensated memory element write process.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The applicant has determined, by many trials and simulations, that by providing a dissymmetry of certain magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic layers forming the free magnetic region of the memory element, it is possible to perform a direct writing into the memory element, even with a compensated structure, by using write magnetic fields of moderate amplitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to a first example of implementation of the write method according to the present invention, which will be described in further detail hereafter, it is desired to obtain a compensated or almost compensated magnetic region for which one of the following properties or the following two properties are different:

<p id="p-0045" num="0046">“Demagnetizing field tensor” is used to designate the tensor having its matrix product with the direction cosines of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer providing the demagnetizing field in this layer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">Indeed, these values are those mainly involved in the phenomena implemented in the first example of implementation of the write method according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The differentiation of the components according to the stacking direction of the ferromagnetic layer demagnetizing field tensors is obtained by providing ferromagnetic layers having different geometries, and/or, different thicknesses.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0056">In this stacking, the following conditions must be respected:

        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0060">and so on, according to needs, so that the same type of ferromagnetic layer (<b>26</b> or <b>28</b>) is found on either side of a separation region <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>′, etc.;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0061">separation regions <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>′, etc. induce a strong ferromagnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic layers that they separate, thus keeping their magnetic moment vectors parallel.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0062">With the above-discussed stacking conditions, each of magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>(respectively, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>) of each free magnetic region <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>′, <b>18</b>″, etc. will exhibit the same behavior under the effect of the write magnetic field sequences of the present invention, and this behavior will be identical to that which would have been exhibited by vector {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>(respectively, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>) of a single free magnetic region such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, in the write phase, the ferromagnetic coupling induced by separation layers <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>′, etc. has but a marginal influence upon the process, and the write parameters will be the same for a free ferromagnetic region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a stacking of free ferromagnetic regions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of same layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>. However, in the information retention phase, the ferromagnetic couplings induced by separation layers <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>′, etc. gather in a same magnetic volume all the free magnetic regions of the stacking, increasing by a factor at least equal to the number of stacked regions the magnetic volume which intervenes in the thermal stability of the recording. Thus, by increasing the number of stacked magnetic regions, it becomes possible to optimize the operation of the memory element by one of the following actions or by a combination of the following actions:
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0065">These points are very advantageous with a view to increasing the density of MRAMs.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0066">Further, since each free magnetic region is compensated or almost compensated, the increase in the number of regions in the stacking is performed with no significant increase in the total magnetic moment, and thus without generating negative effects linked to dipolar interactions between cells.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0067">This periodic stacking model is described hereabove for the case where the write fields are uniform across the entire thickness of the stacking. A moderate deviation with respect to this constraint may easily be compensated for by an adjustment of the parameters of each free magnetic region of the stacking.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0068">An alternative embodiment with a smaller stack of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> comprises two free magnetic regions <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>′ only, between which separation layer <b>36</b> has been brought down to a zero thickness. The free magnetic region then comprises a stacking of three ferromagnetic layers: a lower ferromagnetic layer, an intermediary ferromagnetic layer, and an upper ferromagnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0069">According to a second example of implementation of the write method according to the present invention, which will be described in further detail hereafter, it is desired to obtain a compensated or almost compensated free magnetic region for which the effective planar free magnetic fields of the ferromagnetic layers are different. The effective planar anisotropy field of a ferromagnetic layer is the general anisotropy field, which characterizes the anisotropy of the magnetic power of the ferromagnetic layer when its magnetization rotates in the plane perpendicular to the stacking direction. This effective anisotropy field integrates the anisotropy field of crystallographic origin and the shape anisotropy due to the anisotropy of the demagnetizing field tensor.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0070">The difference between the planar effective anisotropy fields of the ferromagnetic layers can thus be obtained by one of the following possibilities or by a combination of the following possibilities:

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0074">The present invention also applies to a stacking of free compensated or almost compensated ferromagnetic layers, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with the same conditions relative to the forming of the stacking as those described hereabove for the first example of the present invention, and providing the same advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0075">According to the first and to the second examples of implementation of the write method according to the present invention, the applicant has pointed out that at the time of the application of adapted write magnetic fields, magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>of opposite directions of at least two ferromagnetic layers move with different trajectories, however correlated through the antiferromagnetic interaction binding them. This enables, with adapted write magnetic fields, orienting with certainty the magnetic moment vector of the ferromagnetic layer as close as possible to the barrier layer along a selected direction and orientation, while minimizing the maximum value reached by total magnetic moment {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot </sub>of the free magnetic region during the write process.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0076">Two examples of implementation of the write method according to the present invention will now be described. For clarity, a memory element <b>16</b> having its free magnetic region <b>18</b> comprising two ferromagnetic layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will be considered with no loss of generality.

Ferromagnetic layer <b>28</b> is formed of a second ferromagnetic material, different from the first ferromagnetic material, for example, a nickel and iron alloy, and has a thickness e<sub>2 </sub>and a saturation magnetization M<sub>S2</sub>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0078">The compensation of magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>is thus obtained by the following equality:

</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0086">The first example of implementation of the method for writing into a memory element according to the present invention is based on the use of magnetic precession.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of a sequence of magnetic fields applied to memory element <b>16</b> to take advantage from the magnetic precession effect. In a write step, a pulsed magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>of a duration ΔT equal to approximately 400 picoseconds is applied to memory element <b>16</b>. The sign of magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>may be positive or negative. During time ΔT, a positive or negative pulsed magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>of a duration ΔT′ smaller than approximately 200 picoseconds is applied. To enable obtaining the precession phenomenon, the rise time of pulsed magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>must theoretically be much shorter than the precession periods of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>. Experimentally, rise times on the order of from 60 to 80 ps enable triggering precessions of a period up to 6 GHz, corresponding to the parameters of the layers studied herein. The pulse of magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>may be applied at any time during the pulse of magnetic field H<sub>X</sub>, provided that H<sub>X </sub>alone is not sufficient to modify the orientations of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>.

The occurrence of a component of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>along axis (OZ) immediately creates demagnetizing fields along (OZ), of opposite directions for layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. These demagnetizing fields attempt to have {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>rotate towards each other by precession around (OZ), which violates the principle of minimization of the antiferromagnetic interaction power through layer <b>24</b>. Under the effect of all the magnetic power sources in the system (antiferromagnetic interaction power, fields H<sub>X</sub>, H<sub>Y</sub>, demagnetizing fields and anisotropy power of crystallographic origin), one of vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>(called hereafter the “master vector”) will continue its precession around (OZ), driving the other vector (called hereafter the “slave vector”) which will thus start its way back and start a rotation of same direction keeping as much as possible the antiparallel alignment between {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>, which minimizes the maximum value reached by total magnetic moment vector {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot </sub>during the process. According to the exact parameters of the experiment, additional precessions of small amplitude may superpose to the average operation described hereabove without putting its principle at stake.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0089">This phenomenon of simultaneous reversal of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>minimizing {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot </sub>can be obtained for identical layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, but it then only enables a toggle write mode. The differentiation of the magnetic properties of layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> enables obtaining a direct write mode. In the latter, for adapted couples of values of magnetic fields H<sub>X</sub>, H<sub>Y</sub>, it can be ensured that according to their initial positions, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>keep their initial positions or perform a precession around the associated demagnetizing magnetic field to reach positions opposite to the initial positions. For adapted couples of magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y</sub>, it can thus be ensured that the final position of the magnetic moment vector closest to barrier layer <b>20</b> is according to a desired orientation and direction.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0090">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a non-complete set of areas <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> of amplitudes of magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y</sub>, magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>being positive, for which a toggle of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>, initially oriented along axis (OX) according to the decreasing X values, is systematically obtained. This diagram has been determined with the following values of the magnetic properties of the layers: e<sub>1</sub>=5 nm, M<sub>S1</sub>=2.2 Tesla, e<sub>2</sub>=10 nm, M<sub>S2</sub>=1.1 Tesla, H<sub>A1</sub>=5.41 kA/m (=68 Oe), H<sub>A2</sub>=1.11 kA/m (=14 Oe), ΔT=ΔT′=200 ps, H<sub>J1</sub>=H<sub>J2</sub>=15.9 kA/m (=200 Oe). For a negative magnetic field H<sub>Y</sub>, the obtained areas are symmetrical with respect to the abscissa axis. Areas <b>41</b> corresponding to negative magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and areas <b>42</b> corresponding to positive magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>for which a toggle of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>is observed are both obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0091">Areas <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> comprise “white” portions <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, delimited by the curves in full lines which correspond to magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>for which the norm of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot</sub>, noted hereafter as {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot</sub>, exceeds the norm of magnetic moment vector {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>, noted μ<sub>1 </sub>hereafter, at least at a time during the toggle of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>. Areas <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> comprise black portions <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>, which correspond to magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>for which μ<sub>tot </sub>never exceeds μ<sub>1 </sub>during the toggle of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0092">To minimize interactions between memory element <b>16</b> and the adjacent memory elements, it is thus preferable to remain limited to magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>associated with black portions <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>. It must further be kept to magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>for which, whatever the initial orientation of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>, the same final orientation is always obtained. This is obtained by taking into account the fact that areas <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are not symmetrical with respect to the ordinate axis due to the dissymmetry of the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic layers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows write areas <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> obtained from areas <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and corresponding to values of magnetic fields H<sub>X</sub>, H<sub>Y </sub>which impose a determined final orientation of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>, whatever its initial orientation.

Magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>associated with write area <b>47</b> enable ensuring that {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>is finally oriented towards increasing X values and the magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>associated with write area <b>48</b> enable ensuring that {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>is finally oriented towards decreasing X values.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref> respectively show a simulation of the variation of components μ<sub>1X</sub>, μ<sub>1Y</sub>, μ<sub>1Z </sub>(curves in full lines) of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>, in referential (OX, OY, OZ) and of components μ<sub>2X</sub>, μ<sub>2Y</sub>, μ<sub>2Z </sub>(curves in dotted lines) of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>for a negative magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>having an amplitude equal to 9,710 A/m (=122 Oe) and a positive magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>having an amplitude equal to 1,590 A/m (=20 Oe). The simulation uses the same parameters as those used to calculate <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The components are normated at μ<sub>1</sub>, which is identical to μ<sub>2</sub>, the norm of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>, for a compensated memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0095">As appears from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>, and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>are initially oriented along axis (OX) respectively towards decreasing and increasing X values. Initial time t=0 corresponds to the setting of magnetic field H<sub>Y</sub>. It can be observed that {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>toggles in less than 1 nanosecond after application of the pulse of magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>to orient along axis (OX) towards increasing X values. After the toggle, oscillations of smaller amplitude can be observed for a few nanoseconds. However, the oscillations appear to be widely damped off after 3 nanoseconds. At 5 nanoseconds, the state of memory element <b>16</b> is completely stabilized. The first example of implementation of the write method according to the present invention thus enables achieving a write period of approximately 3 nanoseconds with the parameters used herein for the calculation, aside from any optimization.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0096">Further, μ<sub>tot </sub>remains very small all along the toggle of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and, in particular, at no time does it exceed μ<sub>1</sub>. Moreover, μ<sub>tot </sub>takes its maximum value only over a very short duration during the toggle of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>. The part taken by {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>tot </sub>in the disturbances of the memory elements adjacent to the addressed memory element because of dipolar interactions is thus very small. Further, the short duration and the small amplitudes of magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>enable minimizing the power required for the writing.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0097">By many simulations over a wide range of magnetic parameters, and a detailed study of the obtained behaviors, the applicant has besides found that the direct write process according to this first example of the present invention is more favorable when the ferromagnetic layer of stronger saturation magnetization also has the strong effective planar anisotropy.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0098">More generally, in the design of the free magnetic region of a compensated or almost compensated memory element, the conjunction of the dissymmetry of the anisotropy field of crystallographic origin and of the demagnetizing fields must be ensured to increase the dissymmetry of areas <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> and reduce the amplitude of fields H<sub>X</sub>, H<sub>Y </sub>necessary to the write process.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows write areas <b>49</b>, <b>50</b> analogous to write areas <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and calculated with the same magnetic parameters except for e<sub>2</sub>=12 nm, which provides μ<sub>2</sub>=1.2 μ<sub>1</sub>. Memory element <b>16</b> then has no longer a compensated structure but an almost compensated structure. An increase in the surface area of write areas <b>49</b>, <b>50</b> with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be observed. In particular, the writing into the memory element can be performed with magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>having amplitudes smaller than the respective amplitudes of the magnetic fields required for the writing into a compensated memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows write areas <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, analogous to write areas <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and calculated with the same magnetic parameters except for e<sub>1</sub>=6 nm, which provides μ<sub>1</sub>=1.2 μ<sub>2</sub>. A decrease in the surface area of write areas <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be observed. Such a modification of the compensation of the memory element is thus not desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0101">The physical origin of the differences between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> is linked to the fact that, with the values of magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>corresponding to write areas <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>is the master vector and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>is the slave vector in the write process. By analyzing in detail the various corresponding magnetic powers and actions, it can be verified that a slight decompensation of the free magnetic area which reinforces the norm of the master vector (respectively, the slave vector) is favorable to the write process (respectively, unfavorable), in that it decreases (respectively, increases) fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>necessary to the writing, and increases (respectively, decreases) the extension of the area of fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>enabling direct writing.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0102">More generally, for a free magnetic region <b>18</b> having two or more ferromagnetic layers, more favorable write areas are obtained by selecting an almost compensated rather than compensated structure, formed by stacking, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, free almost compensated magnetic regions <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>′, <b>18</b>″ where the norm of the magnetic moment vector acting as a master vector in the write process has been increased.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0103">The applicant has shown the presence of a write magnetic field range of relatively moderate amplitudes enabling writing of a compensated memory element, and has described the method for optimizing the location and the extent of this range by playing on the dissymmetry of the magnetic properties of the free magnetic region of the memory element. Further, the application has shown that the amplitude of the magnetic fields usable for the writing into a memory element by selecting a specific almost compensated structure can be decreased.

    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0104">2) Second Example of Implementation of the Write Method According to the Present Invention</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0105">The second example of implementation of the method for writing into a memory element according to the present invention is based on the use of the response difference of magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>upon application of a magnetic field (with a slow rise time with respect to the setting of a precession mode), when a difference exists between the planar effective anisotropy fields of the ferromagnetic layers of the free magnetic region of the memory element. For a memory element <b>16</b> having a compensated or almost compensated free magnetic region <b>18</b> with two ferromagnetic layers, anisotropy field H<sub>A1 </sub>of ferromagnetic layer <b>26</b> adjacent to barrier layer <b>20</b> is greater than anisotropy field H<sub>A2 </sub>of the other ferromagnetic layer <b>28</b>. For a memory element <b>16</b> having a free magnetic region comprising at least three ferromagnetic layers and formed by a stacking of compensated or almost compensated free magnetic regions as described for and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the anisotropy field of a ferromagnetic layer having its associated magnetic moment vector oriented like the magnetic moment vector associated with the ferromagnetic layer adjacent to the barrier layer is greater than the anisotropy field of any ferromagnetic layer having its magnetic moment oriented in the direction opposite to that of the magnetic moment vector associated with the ferromagnetic layer adjacent to the barrier layer.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> schematically shows the orientation of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>before application of magnetic field H<sub>X</sub>. {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>is initially oriented along axis (OX) towards increasing X values and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>is initially oriented along axis (OX) towards decreasing X values. The same magnetic property values of the layers as for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> are used for the example, that is: e<sub>1</sub>=5 nm, M<sub>S1</sub>=2.2 Tesla, e<sub>2</sub>=10 nm, M<sub>S2</sub>=1.1 Tesla, H<sub>A1</sub>=5.41 kA/m (=68 Oe), H<sub>A2</sub>=1.11 kA/m (=14 Oe), H<sub>J1</sub>=H<sub>J2</sub>=15.9 kA/m (=200 Oe). The calculation being made for a zero temperature, times ΔT and ΔT′ of application have no meaning in this calculation. In a real experimental process, it is enough for these durations to be longer than the times of relaxation of magnetic moment vectors {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>towards their positions of equilibrium. The applicant has shown that for a negative magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>having an absolute value smaller than 11,937 A/m (=150 Oe), the orientation of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>does not significantly change, and any change remains reversible. For a negative magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>having an absolute value greater than 11,937 A/m (=150 Oe), an irreversible switching, also called “spin-flop”, can be observed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows an example of a configuration obtained for the application of a negative magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>having an absolute value equal to 14,334 A/m (=180 Oe).

When magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>is reset to zero, under the effect of its greatest planar effective anisotropy power, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>joins axis (OX) towards the decreasing X values and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>switches to align along axis (OX) towards increasing X values under the effect of the antiferromagnetic interaction.</p>

When magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>is set back to zero, under the effect of its greatest planar effective anisotropy power, {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>aligns back on axis (OX) towards the decreasing X values. {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>is then sent back along axis (OX) towards increasing X values under the effect of the antiferromagnetic interaction. The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, identical to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, is then obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0112">A direct writing method is thus obtained since {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>is oriented in determined fashion, according to the applied magnetic field H<sub>X</sub>, whatever the initial configuration.

<p id="p-0096" num="0113">The applicant has shown that when a positive magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>having an absolute value of approximately 1,591 A/m (=20 Oe) is applied simultaneously to H<sub>X</sub>, a switching of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>is obtained for a negative magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>having an absolute value greater than approximately 10,345 A/m (=130 Oe), that is, for a magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>having an absolute value smaller than the absolute value of magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>applied alone in the previously-described example. A magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>alone with an absolute value of approximately 1,591 A/m (=20 Oe) is not enough to switch {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>, and since the switching absolute value of magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>is lowered when magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>are simultaneously applied, it is possible to use a pair of magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y </sub>to directly write information into a single memory element <b>16</b> without changing the state of the memory elements which are only addressed by one or the other of magnetic fields H<sub>X </sub>or H<sub>Y</sub>. With the free magnetic region parameters retained for the calculation, an increase in the absolute value of magnetic field H<sub>Y </sub>beyond approximately 2000 A/m (a few tens of Oe) is not favorable to obtain the switching of {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1 </sub>and {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2</sub>, since it is then necessary to apply a magnetic field H<sub>X </sub>having a greater amplitude to obtain the switching.</p>

Due to the symmetry in the magnetism equations, the same direct write method (only the sign of H<sub>X </sub>must change) may be performed by giving a greater planar effective anisotropy to layer <b>28</b>, the magnetic moment vector {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>2 </sub>of this layer <b>28</b> then acting as the master vector in the write process, and the antiferromagnetic coupling between layers <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> through layer <b>24</b> guaranteeing the final alignment of magnetic moment vector {right arrow over (μ)}<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0125">It is finally important to underline that this second example of implementation of the write method according to the present invention enables, by applying a static field of adapted components H<sub>X </sub>and H<sub>Y</sub>, uniform or almost uniform over an entire MRAM, giving the same orientation to all the free magnetic regions of all the memory elements in the network. Such a field may easily be created by sources external to the circuit (magnet, electromagnet). Such an action may be useful, for example, to set or reset the operation of a memory, for example, at the end of its manufacturing, or to very quickly erase an entire MRAM when the security of an information depends on this.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0126">This last setting method is also identically applicable to a MRAM defined in the meaning of the first example of implementation of the write method according to the present invention, provided that there exists a planar effective anisotropy field difference for the ferromagnetic layers of the free magnetic region of the compensated or almost compensated memory element.</p>

Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the foregoing description is by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting.
