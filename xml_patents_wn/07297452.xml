<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0112255 filed on Dec. 24, 2004, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0002">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a photosensitive resin composition, a thin film panel including a layer made with the photosensitive resin composition, and method of manufacturing the thin film panel. In particular, the invention relates to a photosensitive resin composition for insulation of a display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0004">(b) Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0005">An active type display device such as an active matrix (AM) liquid crystal display (LCD) and an active matrix organic light emitting diode (OLED) display includes a plurality of pixels arranged in a matrix. The pixels in the matrix include switching elements, and the pixel boundaries are usually formed by a plurality of signal lines such as gate lines and data lines for transmitting signals to the switching elements. The switching elements of the pixels selectively transmit data signals from the data lines to the pixels in response to gate signals from the gate lines for displaying images. The pixels of the LCD adjust the transmittance of incident light according to the data signals, while those of the OLED display adjust the luminance of light emission according to the data signals.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0006">The LCD and the OLED displays include a panel provided with the TFTs, the field-generating electrodes, the signal lines, etc. The panel has a layered structure that includes several conductive layers and insulating layers. The gate lines, the data lines, and the field-generating electrodes are formed of different conductive layers and separated by insulating layers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0007">The insulating layers are made of inorganic or organic insulators. Organic insulators have a transmittance higher than the inorganic insulators, and therefore often result in increased luminance (and an increased reference viewing angle for an LCD). Several of these organic insulators have a photosensitivity level that allows them to be patterned only by lithography without etching, thereby simplifying the display manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0008">However, conventional photosensitive organic insulating layers often have spots or stains. In particular, as the display devices increase in size, slit coating or spin-and-slit coating is preferred to spin coating as a method of forming the organic insulating layers, and the slit coating and the spin-and-slit coating of the organic insulating layers frequently generate stains. The stains may be horizontal stains along a direction of a slit type nozzle of a coating device, vertical stains along a length direction of the slit type nozzle, and irregular spots over an entire surface of a substrate. In addition, portions of the organic layer near the edges of a substrate are sometimes thicker than other portions of the organic layer. These portions with extra thickness may not completely dissolve during the development such that they remain to form stains, degrading the image quality of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0009">A method and device for forming organic insulating layers with fewer stains is desired.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0157">The photosensitive resin composition may be formed by mixing a solution containing an alkali-soluble resin dissolved in a solvent, another solution containing a quinone diazide in a solvent, and another solution containing a surfactant in a solvent. A solvent may be added to a mixture of an alkali-soluble resin, a quinone diazide, and a surfactant.

<p id="p-0164" num="0160">Examples of the coating of the photosensitive film include slit coating using a coating device having slit type nozzles, slit-and-spin coating that first coats using a nozzle and then coats using a spin coater, die coating, and curtain flow coating. Of these coating methods, the slit-and-spin coating is preferred. After the coating, the photosensitive resin composition may be prebaked to remove volatile ingredients such as solvents, thereby forming the photosensitive resin film containing substantially no volatile ingredient. The photosensitive resin film may have a thickness of about 1.0 microns to about 8.0 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0161">Next, the photosensitive film is subjected to a first exposure through a mask. The mask has a pattern suitable for the function of the hardened resin pattern. The light exposure illuminates a light such as g line or g line vertically over an entire surface of the photosensitive resin film, and aligns the mask with the photosensitive resin film using a mask aligner or a stepper.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0162">The photoresist resin film is then developed by puddle development, immersion development, or spray development.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0163">The development may be performed by using an alkaline aqueous solution. The alkaline aqueous solution contains an inorganic alkaline compound or an organic alkaline compound.</p>

<p id="p-0171" num="0167">The developer may contain a surfactant such as a nonionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, and an anionic surfactant.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0172">The developer may include an organic solvent including water-soluble solvents such as methanol and ethanol.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0173">The developer dissolves exposed portions of the photosensitive resin film, which are exposed to light, and leaves unexposed portions of the photosensitive resin film to form a film pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0174">Since the photosensitive resin composition includes the quinone diazide, the exposed portions of the photosensitive resin film is quickly removed in a short time, while the unexposed portions thereof is hardly removed even though they are in contact with the developer for a long time.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0175">After the development, the substrate with the film pattern is cleaned with deionized water and dried.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0176">A portion or an entire portion of the film pattern is then subjected to a second light exposure preferably using (deep) ultraviolet (UV) ray. The illumination of UV on unit area in the second light exposure may be higher than that in the first light exposure. The second light exposure is conducted in order to lighten transparency of the film pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0177">The photosensitive resin pattern is postbaked at about 150° C. to about 250° C., and more preferably at about 180° C. to about 240° C. for about 5 to about 120 minutes, and more preferably for about 15 to about 90 minutes. The postbaking is performed by heating the substrate with a hot plate, a clean oven, etc. The postbaking improves the heat resistance and the solvent resistance of the cured photosensitive resin pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0336" num="0332">The coating is performed by slit coating while moving the substrate <b>110</b> or a nozzle (not shown) of a coater (not shown). The thickness of the coated resin composition is about 1.0 to about 8.0 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0333">The surfactant in the photosensitive resin composition has an improved solubility for solid ingredients such as the alkali-soluble resin and the quinone diazide to make the coating deposit uniformly. Accordingly, a uniformly thick coating can be formed.</p>

<p id="p-0339" num="0335">Next, the photosensitive film is aligned with a mask by using a mask aligner and subjected to a first exposure through the mask. The light exposure illuminates a light such as g line or g line vertically over an entire surface of the photosensitive resin film.</p>

<p id="p-0343" num="0339">A portion or an entire portion of the upper passivation film <b>180</b><i>q </i>is then subjected to a second light exposure preferably using (deep) ultraviolet (UV) ray.

<p id="p-0345" num="0341">Subsequently, the lower passivation film <b>180</b><i>p </i>and the gate insulating layer <b>140</b> are etched using the upper passivation film <b>180</b><i>q </i>as an etch mask to complete the contact holes <b>181</b>, <b>182</b>, <b>185</b> and <b>187</b>.</p>
