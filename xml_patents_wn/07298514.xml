<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a network print system and its printing method of proposing substitute means which is used in the case where a printing apparatus cannot realize setting of print set information when printed matter is outputted by the printing apparatus in a print shop which is connected via the Internet on the basis of the print set information such as picture quality, post-process, and the like on the basis of document information such as an image, characters, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the conventional technique, when document information and print set information stored in a server are downloaded into a print shop via the Internet and printed matter is outputted, if a printing apparatus provided in the print shop can realize print setting (for example, color print, resolution is set to 1200 dpi, and post-processing function is set to corner binding) shown by the print set information, the printing apparatus in the print shop outputs the printed matter in accordance with the print setting. If the printing apparatus provided in the print shop cannot realize print setting shown by the print set information, one of the following operations is selected: (1) the print is executed without using the print set information; (2) the print is executed in accordance with print setting which has newly been set by the user; and (3) the most similar print setting is presented to the user on the basis of the print set information and the user can determine whether he prints or not.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the user often feels that it is tiring to decide the print setting. There is a possibility that the user who is weak in execution of the print setting performs print setting which is quite different from the print set information. Completely different printed matter is outputted in such a case.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the most similar print setting is presented to the user, there is a case where similarity is not sufficient. Even if a print system determines that the print setting is most similar to the print setting shown by the downloaded print set information, the user does not always judge in a manner similar to the above. Even if the user judged in a manner similar to the above, at that time, the user does not always demand to output printed matter by the print setting that is most similar to the print setting shown by the downloaded print set information. Therefore, even if the print setting that is most similar to the print setting shown by the print set information is merely presented to the user, the needs of the user cannot be met.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is made in consideration of the foregoing problems. When a printing apparatus in a print shop cannot realize print setting shown by downloaded print set information, more similar substitute print setting can be proposed to the user, or a plurality of substitute print settings are proposed to the user so as to urge him to select a desired one of them, thereby printed matter can be outputted by the desired print setting of the user.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An embodiment of the invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a constructional diagram showing a whole system of the embodiment. Reference numeral <b>111</b> denotes a user who issues a book of the first edition; <b>112</b> document information to perform a print and a bookbinding process; and <b>113</b> a personal computer (hereinafter, referred to as a PC) connected to the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference numerals <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, and <b>106</b> denote print shops for issuing a book or a copy. The user purchases the book or the copy in the print shop. A PC <b>107</b>, image forming apparatuses <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, and <b>110</b> to output a book and a copy, a local server <b>103</b>, and a LAN <b>101</b> to connect them exist in the print shop.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The local server <b>103</b> is connected to a Web server <b>102</b> via an Internet <b>100</b>. Document information and bookbinding information including document and image data of a book of the first edition are stored in the Web server <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a flow of a print process at the time when the user desires the issue of the first edition. A user <b>211</b> inputs document information <b>202</b> to be printed and bookbinding-processed to a PC <b>204</b> and selects a bookbinding method at the time of performing the print and the bookbinding process of the document information <b>202</b> on a display screen of the PC <b>204</b>. The PC <b>204</b> transmits the document information <b>202</b> inputted by the user <b>211</b> and bookbinding information <b>203</b> showing the bookbinding method selected by the user to the Web server <b>102</b> via the Internet <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The Web server <b>102</b> transmits bar code information <b>201</b> corresponding to the received document information <b>202</b> and bookbinding information <b>203</b> to the PC <b>204</b> via the Internet <b>100</b>. The bar code information <b>201</b> is used as an ID. The Web server <b>102</b> manages an access right to the document information <b>202</b> and bookbinding information <b>203</b> stored in the Web server <b>102</b> on the basis of the bar code information <b>201</b>. The Web server <b>102</b> holds a storing device (not shown) which can store the document information <b>202</b>, bookbinding information <b>203</b>, and bar code information <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If the user <b>211</b> wants the print and the bookbinding process, the Web server <b>102</b> transmits the document information <b>202</b>, bookbinding information <b>203</b>, and bar code information <b>201</b> to a local server <b>214</b>. After the local server <b>214</b> received the document information <b>202</b>, bookbinding information <b>203</b>, and bar code information <b>201</b>, it adds the bar code information <b>201</b> to the document information. The local server <b>214</b> transmits the document information <b>202</b> to which the bar code information <b>201</b> has been added and the bookbinding information <b>203</b> to one of image forming apparatuses <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>207</b>, and <b>208</b> via a local area network (hereinafter, abbreviated to LAN) <b>215</b>. One of the image forming apparatuses <b>205</b> to <b>208</b> executes the print and the bookbinding process in accordance with the bookbinding information <b>203</b> on the basis of the bar code information <b>201</b> and the document information <b>202</b>, thereby forming a book <b>209</b>. The user <b>211</b> pays a cost <b>210</b> including charges for the print and the bookbinding process of the book <b>209</b>, use charges for the storing device in the Web server <b>102</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the book <b>209</b> to which the bar code information <b>201</b> has been added. The bar code information <b>201</b> has been printed onto the last page in the case of a book <b>300</b><i>a</i>. The bar code information <b>201</b> has been printed onto the back cover in the case of a book <b>300</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing processes which are executed in a print shop <b>212</b> when the user <b>211</b> desires to issue the first edition. The user <b>211</b> inputs the document information <b>202</b> to be printed and bookbinding-processed to the PC <b>204</b> existing in the print shop <b>212</b> via a media such as a floppy (registered trademark) disk or the like (step S<b>401</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Subsequently, the PC <b>204</b> calculates server use charges to use the Web server <b>102</b> (S<b>402</b>).
