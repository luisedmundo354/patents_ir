<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention relate to the fabrication of magnetic storage devices. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention are directed to the removal of heat generated during the fabrication of magnetic storage devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Etching processes are often used when shaping the components of magnetic storage devices such as the rails or other air bearing surfaces. An exemplary pallet assembly <b>100</b> used for shaping these components is shown in the exploded perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Pallet assembly <b>100</b> comprises a carrier <b>101</b> which holds a wafer or other component being etched. During use, a plurality of carriers <b>101</b> are slid between arms (e.g., <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b</i>) of frame <b>102</b> which is then coupled with tray <b>103</b> using, for example, screws inserted into holes <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a section view of pallet assembly <b>100</b>. During use, a wafer <b>201</b> is coupled with carrier <b>101</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, carrier <b>101</b> is held between arms <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>due to the dovetail configuration of the back side of carrier <b>101</b>. Carrier <b>101</b> is in direct contact with tray <b>103</b> in region <b>203</b>, thus facilitating heat dissipation from carrier <b>101</b> via conduction to tray <b>103</b>. A plurality of fasteners (e.g., <b>210</b>) couple tray <b>103</b> with frame <b>102</b>. Often, to improve the thermal transfer characteristics of the pallet assembly, carrier <b>101</b> is thermally coupled with frame <b>102</b> using a thermally conductive epoxy. This heat is then conveyed to tray <b>103</b> via fasteners <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pallet assemblies such as <b>101</b> can be used in the fabrication of components used in, for example, magnetic data storage devices. For example, a reactive ion etching (RIE) process or an ion milling process may be used to perform a shallow etch (e.g., approximately 0.18μ) of these components. However, when performing a deeper etch (e.g., approximately 1.32 μ using an ion milling process) current pallet designs cannot dissipate the heat quickly enough. As a result, the carrier and/or wafer can get burned. Thus, conventional pallet assemblies are inadequate in removing heat during deep etch operations.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a pallet assembly which facilitates direct cooling of the wafer carrier. In one embodiment, the pallet assembly comprises a frame which holds at least one carrier of a component. The pallet assembly further comprises a tray which is operable for being mechanically coupled with the frame. The tray comprises at least one discreet region which corresponds with the carrier when the tray is coupled with the frame. In embodiments of the present invention, the discreet region comprises at least one hole extending through the tray for permitting a coolant medium to dissipate heat from the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a chamber, which corresponds with the discreet region, is defined by a gasket coupled with the tray, the carrier, and the tray. A plurality of holes extending through the tray permit a convective flow of the coolant medium into the chamber, thus facilitating the dissipation of heat from the carrier via convection.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the present invention will be described in conjunction with the following embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the present invention to these embodiments alone. On the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents which may be included within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exploded perspective view of an exemplary pallet assembly <b>300</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a carrier <b>301</b> which holds a wafer or other component being etched. Typically, a plurality of carriers <b>301</b> are slid between arms (e.g., <b>302</b><i>a </i>and <b>302</b><i>b</i>) of frame <b>302</b> which is then coupled with tray <b>303</b> using, for example, screws inserted into holes <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Tray <b>303</b> further comprises a plurality of discreet regions (e.g., <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>e</i>) which correspond with a respective carrier <b>301</b> when tray <b>303</b> is coupled with frame <b>302</b>. For purposes of clarity, the side of tray <b>303</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> upon which the discreet regions are disposed will be referred to as the “front side.” In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the discreet regions <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>e </i>is defined by a gasket (e.g., <b>306</b><i>a</i>-<b>306</b><i>e</i>) which surrounds the corresponding discreet area. Furthermore, each of the discreet regions <b>305</b><i>a</i>-<b>305</b><i>e </i>comprises at least one hole extending through tray <b>303</b>. In embodiments of the present invention, holes <b>307</b><i>a</i>-<b>307</b><i>e </i>are for permitting a coolant medium to pass through tray <b>303</b> and dissipate heat from carrier <b>301</b>. In embodiments of the present invention, a convective flow of the coolant medium permits direct cooling of carrier <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a front view of an exemplary discreet region <b>305</b><i>a </i>of a pallet tray in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In embodiments of the present invention, discreet region <b>305</b><i>a </i>comprises a plurality of holes (e.g., <b>401</b><i>a</i>-<b>410</b><i>h</i>) which extend through the pallet tray (e.g., <b>303</b>). Gasket <b>306</b><i>a </i>defines the perimeter of discreet region <b>305</b><i>a</i>. Discreet region <b>305</b><i>a </i>further comprises a chamber maintaining device <b>402</b> which, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is disposed in the center of discreet region <b>305</b><i>a</i>. In embodiments of the present invention, when frame <b>302</b> is coupled with tray <b>303</b>, a chamber, corresponding to a given discreet region, is created behind each of the carriers in the frame. In embodiments of the present invention, the chamber is defined by the back side of carrier <b>301</b>, the front side of tray <b>303</b>, and along the inner edges of a corresponding gasket (e.g., <b>306</b><i>a</i>). A coolant medium can enter the chamber (e.g., via holes <b>401</b><i>a</i>-<b>401</b><i>h</i>) to dissipate heat from the back side of carrier <b>302</b>. Chamber maintaining device <b>402</b> is for preventing carrier <b>301</b> from compressing gasket <b>306</b><i>a </i>such that the flow of a cooling medium would be impeded when frame <b>302</b> is coupled with tray <b>303</b>. In embodiments of the present invention, chamber maintaining device <b>402</b> comprises a heat resistant material such as heat resistant tape. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one chamber maintaining device <b>402</b> embodiments of the present invention are well suited for using a plurality of these devices disposed in various locations of discreet region <b>305</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows discreet region <b>305</b><i>a </i>comprising eight holes, it is appreciated that in embodiments of the present invention the number of holes in the discreet region may be one or more holes.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a section view of an exemplary pallet tray <b>303</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, tray <b>303</b> has not been coupled with frame <b>302</b>. Holes <b>501</b><i>a </i>and <b>501</b><i>b </i>are screw holes for mechanically coupling tray <b>303</b> with frame <b>302</b>. While the present embodiment recites mechanically coupling tray <b>303</b> with frame <b>302</b>, other methods (e.g., a thermally conductive epoxy) may be used as well. Furthermore, gasket <b>306</b><i>a </i>is shown in an un-compressed state prior to coupling with frame <b>302</b>. Holes <b>401</b><i>c</i>, <b>401</b><i>e</i>, <b>401</b><i>h</i>, and <b>401</b><i>d </i>are also shown extending through tray <b>303</b>. Chamber maintaining device <b>402</b> is again shown disposed in the center of discreet region <b>305</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a section view of an exemplary pallet assembly in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, frame <b>302</b> has been coupled with tray <b>303</b> using screws <b>602</b><i>a </i>and <b>602</b><i>b</i>. Carrier <b>301</b> is now disposed between arms <b>302</b><i>a </i>and <b>302</b><i>b </i>of frame <b>302</b>. Furthermore, chamber maintaining device <b>402</b> now contacts the back side of carrier <b>301</b> to prevent further compression of gasket <b>306</b><i>a</i>. In so doing, chamber <b>605</b> is formed which allows a coolant medium <b>606</b> to enter chamber <b>605</b> (e.g., via hole <b>401</b><i>c</i>) and dissipate heat from carrier <b>301</b>. As a result, carrier <b>301</b> is now directly cooled by coolant medium <b>606</b> rather than relying upon tray <b>303</b> to conduct the heat away. Coolant medium <b>606</b> can also exit chamber <b>605</b> (e.g., via hole <b>401</b><i>d</i>) and convey the heat away from pallet assembly <b>600</b>. In one embodiment, coolant medium <b>606</b> is helium gas.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As a result, when fabricating component <b>601</b> (e.g., a magnetic head element) heat is conveyed to carrier <b>301</b> and is then dissipated by the convective flow of coolant medium <b>606</b> past carrier <b>301</b>. Embodiments of the present invention are more efficient than conventional pallet assemblies in conveying heat away during the fabrication of component <b>601</b>. As a result, a deep etch using, for example, the ion milling process can be achieved using embodiments of the present invention. Additionally, embodiments of the present invention are more efficient than conventional pallet assemblies in dissipating heat during other etch processes such as reactive ion etching.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>700</b> for providing direct cooling of a pallet component in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In step <b>710</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a carrier of a component is coupled with a frame. As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, carrier <b>301</b> can be coupled with frame <b>302</b> by, for example, sliding the dovetail portion on the back side of carrier <b>310</b> between arms <b>302</b><i>a </i>and <b>302</b><i>b </i>of carrier <b>302</b>. In embodiments of the present invention, carrier <b>301</b> may be used to hold a magnetic head component (e.g., <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step <b>720</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the frame is coupled with a tray. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, frame <b>302</b> may be coupled with tray <b>303</b> using, for example, screws <b>602</b><i>a </i>and <b>602</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>730</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a coolant medium is used to dissipate heat from the carrier. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, coolant medium <b>606</b> may enter chamber <b>605</b> via one or more holes which extend through tray <b>303</b>. In chamber <b>605</b>, coolant medium <b>606</b> directly contacts carrier <b>302</b> and dissipates heat it. Coolant medium <b>606</b> can also leave chamber <b>605</b> via one or more of the holes extending through tray <b>303</b> and convey heat away from carrier <b>302</b>. In so doing, embodiments of the present invention provide a method for directly cooling a pallet component which is more efficient than convention pallet designs in dissipating heat.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The preferred embodiment of the present invention, direct cooling pallet tray for temperature stability for deep ion mill etch process, is thus described. While the present invention has been described in particular embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by such embodiments, but rather construed according to the following claims.</p>
