<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to aircraft, and, more specifically, to determining aircraft altitude.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For aircraft certification and modeling for simulation, the actual height of the aircraft during flight must be determined accurately within a threshold value typically of a few feet. This is required in order to pass various certifications. One method for calculating aircraft height uses a barometric loop (baro loop) of inertial reference sensor data. However, the baro loop produces some errors that reduce the accuracy when determining actual aircraft altitude.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other current methods use height derived from inertial vertical speed with corrections for ambient pressure and temperature. However, these methods may not have desired accuracy for these applications. This is due to designs of aircraft inertial systems, which bias their vertical calculations with pressure inputs from the aircraft's sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there exists an unmet need to more accurately determine aircraft height for post-flight testing and aircraft modeling.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, apparatus, and computer program product for accurately determining aircraft altitude, impact pressure, and calibrated air speed. The determined results may be used for analysis in certification processes, used for building flight testing or simulation models that also may used in certification processes, or used for other purposes such as data to be used in a flight simulator.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment of the present invention, altitude information of an aircraft is determined based on recorded altitude information generated by an inertial navigation system (INS) of the aircraft and altitude information generated by a global positioning system (GPS) of the aircraft. A static pressure value is generated based on the determined altitude information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect of the invention, the altitude information is adjusted based on known aircraft position defined by a system other than the INS and the GPS.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the invention, an integration is performed of a temperature adjusted vertical velocity value produced by the INS or a double integration is performed of a vertical acceleration value produced by the INS, and the result of either integration is adjusted according to aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw. A least squares fit is performed between the INS altitude information and the GPS altitude information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In still another aspect of the invention, impact pressure is generated based on the generated static pressure and previously recorded pressure information from a pitot static system of the aircraft. Calibrated airspeed is generated based on the generated impact pressure and aircraft performance data or a simulation model is built based on the calibrated airspeed</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for accurately determining aircraft altitude for use in a simulation model for testing various aspects of an aircraft relative to an actual flight test. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>20</b> is illustrated for generating aircraft altitude information in accordance with the present invention. The system <b>20</b> includes a computer <b>24</b> that receives data obtained by components of an aircraft <b>30</b>. The aircraft <b>30</b> includes a data acquisition system <b>34</b> that stores data in a memory <b>36</b>. The stored data is received from an Inertial Navigation System (INS) <b>40</b>, a Global Position System (GPS) <b>42</b>, a Radar Altimeter (RADAlt) <b>44</b>, and various aircraft sensors <b>46</b>, such as without limitation a pitot static system, and aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw sensors. After the aircraft <b>30</b> has completed a designated test, the computer <b>24</b> retrieves the data stored in the memory <b>36</b>. The computer <b>24</b> retrieves the data from the memory <b>36</b> by a direct connection or a wireless connection. In another embodiment, the memory <b>36</b> includes a removable memory device that includes the stored data. The computer <b>24</b> receives the memory device in a receiving port.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The computer <b>24</b> is a general purpose computer, such as without limitation a personal computer, a laptop, a mainframe, or a hand-held computer. The computer <b>24</b> includes memory, a processor, various user interfaces, such as without limitation a keyboard, a mouse, and a display. The computer <b>24</b> determines aircraft altitude or pressure that the aircraft <b>30</b> is experiencing at various points in time during a test scenario according to an exemplary process described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary process <b>80</b> is illustrated for generating highly accurate aircraft altitude information, pressure information, and calibrated airspeed (CAS) for use in post-flight test analysis. The process <b>80</b> begins at a block <b>82</b> where barometric pressure is measured at the ground in the vicinity of where the flight test is taking place. The barometric pressure measurement is performed shortly before or soon after the flight test, or both. This measurement is taken in order to get an accurate measurement of barometric pressure throughout the period of the flight test. At a block <b>84</b>, during the test flight, the total pressure is measured by the aircraft <b>30</b> at a pre-defined sampling rate. Total pressure P<sub>T </sub>is measured by the aircraft's pitot system. At a block <b>86</b>, a history of static pressure values at altitude during the test flight are suitably generated after the test flight has occurred. Generation of a history of static pressure values is described in more detail below with regards to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. At a block <b>88</b>, for each sample period of time the static pressure P<sub>S </sub>is subtracted from the total pressure P<sub>T </sub>in order to get impact pressure. In one embodiment, CAS is determined from the impact pressure using Bernoulli's equation. At a block <b>92</b>, a simulation model is built using the CAS and data from other aircraft sensors <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, generation of static pressure values P<sub>S </sub>is shown as performed at the block <b>86</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The exemplary process <b>86</b> begins at a block <b>104</b> wherein the computer <b>24</b> determines change in height values (Δh) using INS information. The change in height Δh is determined by double integrating an INS vertical acceleration value or taking a single integration of a temperature adjusted INS vertical velocity value. Equation 1 below is an example equation for generating the temperature adjusted INS vertical velocity value.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0024">At a block <b>106</b>, GPS altitude information along a test flight is determined. At a block <b>108</b>, the GPS information is compared to the INS information during an appropriate test period. At a block <b>110</b>, improved height values of the aircraft <b>30</b> are determined based on the comparison. At a block <b>112</b>, the determined improved height values are adjusted based on a known aircraft location point. At a block <b>114</b>, static pressure P<sub>S </sub>is generated based on the determined height values.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">The following calculations are suitably performed to correct INS height data (i.e., generating improved height values of the aircraft <b>30</b>). A relatively stable period of flight is selected for generating the improved height values. Equations 2 and 3 below are two different methods for calculating an INS Δh according to aircraft position.

This is an example test flight that may be analyzed by embodiments of the present invention in order to produce accurate altitude values in a post-test analysis of the aircraft <b>200</b> after having flown a flight path <b>204</b> to touchdown on the runway <b>202</b>. A calculation of the height data performed by the process of the block <b>86</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is performed twice. The first time is at the block <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) when the GPS information is compared to the INS information. The initial starting location of the INS information is irrelevant to actual aircraft height, so therefore it is adjusted to the start point of the GPS information. The second adjustment occurs at the block <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), where a known aircraft location point is used to further adjust the height values that are determined in the block <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one example for determining a known aircraft location point. In the test flight shown, the aircraft <b>200</b> is at some threshold distance from the runway <b>202</b> (not to be confused with the runway threshold) where the ground under the flight test profile (i.e., flight path <b>204</b>) has been mapped so that its true surface height is known. The computer <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) uses stored radar altimeter information at the threshold point to determine the height of the aircraft <b>200</b> at the threshold point. The determined height information at the threshold point is used in the second adjustment. This process may be likewise performed for a takeoff from the runway <b>202</b>.</p>
