<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to refrigerated food and drink storage units, and in particular, to compact drawer refrigerators in which the storage space is defined by one or more pull-out door drawers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Refrigerators and coolers for the cold storage of food and beverage items are well known. Many conventional refrigerators and beverage coolers have one or more doors that are hinged to the front side of the cabinet. Food and beverages are ordinarily stored on shelves in the cabinet and the door(s) as well as in slide out crisper drawers near the bottom of the cabinet. This is common for industrial and residential refrigerators and beverage coolers as either full-size standup units or compact, under-cabinet units.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Drawer refrigerators are also well known in which the doors are replaced by pull-out drawers having bins in which the food is stored. Drawer refrigerators can be preferred in certain applications, such as low, under-cabinet applications, because the food items can be slid out of the cabinet in the drawer and thereby be accessed more easily. Often such drawer refrigerators have two, or possibly more, pull-out drawers that are arranged side by side or vertically stacked one above the other so that not all of the items are stored in the same drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One problem with stacked drawer refrigerators is that there is considerable temperature variance between the two drawers, such that one drawer, typically the lower drawer, gets colder than the other. This can frustrate the user because, for example, in order for the upper drawer to be at the desired temperature, the lower drawer may be at a temperature that is colder than it should be for beverages or other items. This can be avoided by using two separate evaporator assemblies for each drawer, but at considerable expense. Or, the refrigerator can have a single evaporator, likely at the bottom of the unit, and an active airflow control assembly, such as including movably louvers and an air mover. Again, however, this adds considerable expense to the unit as well as occupies additional space in the interior which could otherwise be used for cold storage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another common issue with drawer refrigerators (with any number or arrangement of drawers) is the efficient allocation of space, that is how to maximize storage capacity within standard height, width and depth dimensions while keeping the items easily accessible. This is a particularly difficult issue to address in drawer refrigerators because of their inherent lack of shelving, unlike conventional hinged door refrigerators, which makes it easy to store items vertically above one another without making them difficult to access, as would be the case if the items were stacked directly on top of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, an improved drawer refrigerator with more uniform cooling and improved storage capacity and accessibility features is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is a compact pull-out drawer type refrigerator for the cold storage of food and beverages. As conventional, the drawer refrigerator has an evaporator inside the refrigerator cabinet, a compressor receiving return refrigerant from the evaporator and a condenser coupled to the compressor and through a restrictor to the evaporator. The unit has several unique aspects that provide improved functionality over previously existing units.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Specifically, in one aspect the invention provides a drawer refrigerator with a cabinet defining an interior chamber opening to the front of the cabinet and having a partition dividing the chamber into two drawer cavities, one above the other. Two pull-out drawers are slidably mounted to the cabinet so that their drawer bins can be moved into and out of the two drawer cavities. The evaporator is disposed within the cabinet along a rear wall thereof so as to extend adjacent both drawer cavities and partitioned such that the temperature difference within the cabinet is preferably no more than about five degrees Fahrenheit at each drawer cavity when the drawers are unloaded with food items. Preferably, the temperature difference is no more than about 3 degrees, and even more preferably the temperature difference is essentially zero. Also, the cabinet can include a mullion extending between opposite upright side walls at the front opening that supports a front edge of the partition and provides a sealing surface for the drawer gaskets.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect the invention provides a drawer refrigerator with a cabinet defining a cavity with a front opening. One or more pull-out drawers are slidably mounted to the cabinet. Each pull-out drawer has a front door panel at least partially closing the front opening and a drawer bin mounted to the door panel. The drawer bin supports a bottle bin, which has a bottle retainer receiving a neck of a bottle resting in the bottle bin. Preferably, the bottle retainer is a unitary feature of the bottle bin in the form of a recess in an upright, preferably front, wall of the bottle bin. If desired, the bottle bin can have two or more bottle retainers. The bottle bin has guides at opposite sides that slidably engage the top edges of opposite side walls of the drawer bin so that it slide essentially clear of the drawer bin to allow better access to food stored within the drawer bin otherwise beneath the bottle bin. The bottle bin can have a integral handle at the front wall to aid in sliding it.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another aspect the invention provides a drawer refrigerator with one or more pull-out drawers slidably mounted within the cabinet having a front door panel, a drawer bin mounted to the door panel, and a side access compartment opening to a side of the drawer bin perpendicular to the door panel. The side access compartment houses a removable storage bin accessible from the side of the drawer bin when the drawer is in an open position in which the door panel is spaced sufficiently from the cabinet. Preferably, the side access compartment is located beneath the drawer bin and extends between opposite sides of the drawer bin parallel with the door panel to two open ends so that the storage bin is accessible from either side of the drawer. A removable transparent panel forms a part of the drawer bin bottom and the top of the side access compartment to allow viewing and access therein from above the drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In still another aspect the invention provides a drawer refrigerator in which the storage space of one or more sliding pull-out drawers is compartmentalized by an adjustable divider fence having a lateral divider extending between opposite side walls of the drawer bin and a transverse divider extending between the door panel and the rear wall of the drawer bin. The lateral and transverse dividers are coupled and releasably locked together at a hub such that when the hub is unlocked the transverse divider can slide between the sides of the drawer bin and the lateral divider can slide between the door panel and the rear wall of the drawer bin independent of the position of the other divider. Preferably, the divider fence is a separate component that can be entirely removed from the drawer bin when not needed. There can be two lateral dividers vertically spaced apart in parallel and two transverse members also vertically spaced apart in parallel. The dividers are preferably elongated rods with plastic contact pads at each end. The hub of the divider fence can have a locking member, preferably a hand operable threaded knob, that contacts one of the dividers to presses it against the adjacent perpendicularly extending divider to inhibit relative movement and thus fix the position of the fence. The hub has a body with two sets of two perpendicular openings for coupling the rods.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, the present invention provides a pull-out drawer type refrigerator with several features to improve ease of use and functionality. The sliding bottle bin provides extra storage for wine or like bottles without hampering access to the items stored in the associated drawer bin. The side access compartment also provides additional storage space in a pull out bin that is easily accessible from either side or the top of the associated drawer. The adjustable fence quickly and easily compartmentalizes the drawer bins for segregated storage of items and can be used to secure taller items in place to prevent tipping. The size of the compartments can be adjusted readily by turning the locking knob and sliding the dividers as desired. The dividers can be slid near perpendicular walls of the drawer bin or removed completely when there is no need to divide up the storage space. Finally, the invention provides for nearly constant and equal temperatures at the drawer bins of multiple pull-out drawers using a single partitioned naturally convective evaporator, thereby allowing the user to store items in either drawer without worrying if it is too cold or too warm for the item as well as obviating the need for multiple evaporator assemblies.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the drawer refrigerator <b>12</b> includes a cabinet <b>14</b> defining an internal chamber <b>16</b> open at a front opening <b>18</b>. The chamber <b>16</b> is divided vertically by a partition <b>20</b> into two vertically aligned drawer cavities <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in which are mounted two drawers <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, respectively, by suitable slide mechanisms <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) mounted to the inside of the cabinet <b>14</b>. The cabinet <b>14</b> and the drawers <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are formed of inner and outer members, of molded plastic or formed metal, with the space therebetween filled with foam insulation as known in the art. A mullion <b>32</b> extends across the front opening <b>18</b> between the drawers <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> to support the front edge of the partition <b>20</b>, which is suitably supported at its side and back edges as well. The mullion <b>32</b> can be heated by a low wattage surface heater (not shown) to remove any condensation that may occur during operation of the refrigerator.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of the pull-out drawers <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> have a front door panel <b>34</b> with a handle <b>36</b> along a top edge and which is designed to be fit with an overlay panel (not shown) matching the cabinetry where the unit is installed. Details of the handle construction and the overlay panel attachment can be found in co-owned pending application Ser. No. 10/076,746, filed Feb. 14, 2002. Attached to the door panels <b>34</b> are drawer bins <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> of slightly different configuration between the respective upper <b>26</b> and lower <b>28</b> drawers. The upper drawer <b>26</b> has deeper opposite side walls <b>40</b> joined at their bottom edges to a bottom wall <b>42</b> and at their back edges by a vented rear wall <b>44</b> that extends only about half the height of the side walls <b>40</b> so that its top edge is set down from the top edges of the side walls <b>40</b>. Two, preferably plastic, runners <b>46</b> are attached, preferably with adhesive, onto the top edges of the side walls <b>40</b> to allow a bottle bin <b>48</b> to slide thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, the bottle bin <b>48</b> has guides <b>50</b> at its sides that wrap over the top of the runners <b>46</b> to allow front to back sliding but limit side to side motion. The bottle bin <b>48</b> can slide from forward travel limiting stops <b>43</b> projecting up from the side walls <b>40</b> to the rear wall <b>44</b> and even past the rear wall <b>44</b> when the drawer <b>26</b> is open sufficiently so as to nearly completely clear from the top of the drawer <b>26</b> and allow nearly full access to the items in the drawer bin. This full retraction of the bottle bin <b>48</b> is permitted by the clearance of the half-height rear wall <b>44</b> and by hold-down brackets <b>52</b> welded to the side walls <b>40</b> and spaced vertically from the runner <b>46</b> that capture the top end of the bottle bin guides <b>50</b>. The brackets <b>52</b> hold down the front side of the bottle bin <b>48</b> to prevent it from tipping backwards when fully retracted and rearward travel limiting stops <b>45</b> projecting up from the tops of the guides <b>50</b> contact the brackets <b>52</b> and prevent the bottle bin <b>48</b> from sliding off of the drawer bin <b>38</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The bottle bin <b>48</b> can be removed by pulling it toward the door panel <b>34</b> and tilting its front end up until its back end clears the brackets <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the bottle bin <b>48</b> is a molded plastic tray or container having a bottom and four upright walls. The back wall is vented and the lip or flange of the side walls defines the guides <b>50</b>. The front wall bows slightly and extends to a lesser height that the other walls. The curled lip <b>54</b> of the front wall defines a handle <b>56</b> in the middle as well as two bottle retainers <b>58</b> in the form of round, nearly semi-circular recesses. These bottle retainers <b>58</b> are designed to cradle the necks of wine, soda and like bottles that may be stored in the bottle bin <b>48</b>. The front to back dimension of the bottle bin <b>48</b> is designed to allow standard wine bottles to lie flat in the bottle bin <b>48</b> with the neck cradled in the bottle retainers <b>58</b> and the side to side dimension allows standard 2-liter bottles to lie across the bottle bin <b>48</b>. As the name suggests, the bottle retainers <b>58</b> secure the bottles by resisting side to side as well as back to front movement of the bottles. Yet, they allow the bottles to be simply lifted from the bottle bin <b>48</b> when desired.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the lower drawer <b>28</b> has a shallower drawer bin <b>39</b> defined by shorter side <b>60</b> and rear <b>62</b> walls. The bottom <b>64</b> of the drawer bin <b>39</b> is formed in part by a translucent removable panel <b>66</b> that permits viewing, and removed access, into a side access compartment <b>68</b> located beneath the drawer bin <b>39</b> behind the door panel <b>34</b>. This compartment <b>68</b> is a channel, generally rectangular in cross-section and parallel to the door panel <b>34</b>, that is open-ended at the sides of the drawer <b>28</b>. The compartment <b>68</b> holds a plastic storage bin <b>70</b>, such as a crisper tray, that when the drawer <b>28</b> is open can fit into and be removed from the compartment <b>68</b> from either open end or from its top side through the interior of the drawer bin <b>39</b> by lifting off panel <b>66</b> (and any items stored thereon).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, the storage bin <b>70</b> has a curved upper periphery or rim extending along its long sides <b>71</b> and short ends <b>73</b>. The curved periphery forms two handles <b>75</b> at the short ends. The handles <b>75</b> and other portions of the curved periphery is rounded at the ends. The handles <b>75</b> generally following one radius and the other portions of the periphery generally following another, larger radius between the sides <b>71</b> such that the outer edge of the periphery is farthest from the ends <b>73</b> at about the midpoint of the handles <b>75</b>. This rounded contour at the ends is designed to self-align the storage bin <b>70</b> if it is slid it into the compartment <b>68</b> misaligned or somewhat off center of the openings of the compartment <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> and <b>10</b>-<b>11</b>, an adjustable divider fence <b>72</b>, shown herein in the upper drawer bin <b>38</b> (although usable in either or both the upper or lower drawing bins), has two lateral divider rods <b>74</b> spaced apart vertically and in parallel and two transverse divider rods <b>76</b> also spaced apart vertically in parallel and perpendicular to the lateral divider rods <b>74</b>. The lateral divider rods <b>74</b> extend between the side walls <b>62</b> and the transverse divider rods extend between the inside of the door panel <b>34</b> and the rear wall <b>64</b>, and thus in this case are shorter than the lateral divider rods <b>74</b>. The pairs of divider rods <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are coupled together and held in a perpendicular crisscross configuration by a hub <b>78</b> having a body <b>80</b> with two sets of two openings <b>82</b> (one set shown) through which the divider rods extend and an upper threaded opening <b>86</b> in which threads a locking turn knob <b>88</b>. The lower end of the knob <b>88</b> is sized so that when the knob <b>88</b> is tightened it contacts the upper lateral divider rod and presses it against the upper transverse divider rod so that their relative positions are fixed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). When the knob <b>88</b> is loosened, the hub <b>78</b> can be slid along the pairs of divider rods to create four compartments. When the hub <b>78</b> is centered in the drawer bin <b>38</b>, the four compartments will be essentially equally sized. The fence <b>52</b> can thus be used to compartmentalize the drawer bin <b>39</b> or to keep stored items secured from movement. If it is not desired to divide up the drawer bin <b>38</b>, the fence <b>72</b> can be adjusted so that the hub <b>78</b> is near one corner of the drawer bin <b>38</b> so that the lateral divider rods <b>74</b> are near the front or rear wall and the transverse divider rods <b>76</b> are near one of the side walls. Or, the entire fence <b>72</b> can be simply lifted out of the drawer bin <b>38</b>. The ends of the each pair of divider rods <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are coupled together with end assemblies <b>90</b> that include flat, cross-shaped contact pads <b>92</b> and an end piece <b>94</b>, which is pressed onto the rods and ultrasonically welded over an opening in the body of the contact pads <b>92</b>. Preferably, the divider rods are metal and the hub and the contact pads are plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The refrigerator is cooled by a generally conventional refrigeration system, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, includes an evaporator <b>100</b> attached to the rear wall within the interior of the cabinet <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The evaporator <b>100</b> has an integral accumulator and an outlet line <b>102</b> which passes gas refrigerant to a compressor <b>106</b>. The output of the compressor <b>106</b> is connected to the inlet of a condenser <b>108</b> having an outlet line <b>110</b> connected to a dryer <b>112</b>. A small diameter capillary tube <b>114</b> leads from the dryer <b>112</b> to an inlet of the evaporator <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As is known, the compressor <b>106</b> draws refrigerant from the evaporator <b>100</b> and accumulator <b>104</b> and discharges the refrigerant under increased pressure and temperature to the condenser <b>108</b>. The hot refrigerant gas entering the condenser <b>108</b> is cooled by air circulated by a fan <b>116</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As the temperature of the refrigerant drops under substantially constant pressure, the refrigerant in the condenser <b>108</b> liquefies. The capillary tube <b>114</b> maintains the high pressure in the condenser <b>108</b> and at the compressor outlet while providing substantially reduced pressure in the evaporator <b>100</b>. This reduced pressure results in a large temperature drop and subsequent absorption of heat by the evaporator <b>100</b>. The compressor <b>106</b>, condenser <b>108</b>, and fan <b>116</b> are located at the bottom of the cabinet <b>10</b> beneath the insulated portion (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The single naturally convective evaporator <b>100</b> extends along the rear wall at the inside of the cabinet so as to be adjacent both upper and lower drawer cavities <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The horizontal partition <b>20</b>, which divides the interior of the cabinet in two, is designed to divide or partition the evaporator <b>100</b> in two parts, preferably so that more (about ⅔) of the evaporator <b>100</b> is located in the upper drawer cavity <b>22</b> than in the lower drawer cavity <b>24</b>, and to restrict air flow between the cavities <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> so that chilled air from the evaporator <b>100</b> is essentially trapped in each and segregated from the other drawer cavity so that the cabinet has a nearly uniform temperature at each drawer cavity <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. The partition helps prevent cold air from settling near the bottom of the cabinet and prevents the temperature in the lower drawer from being substantially cooler than that in the upper drawer. The vented rear walls of the bottle bin <b>48</b> and the upper drawer bin <b>38</b> also allow cool air from the evaporator to reach the food in the upper drawer <b>26</b>, further aiding in cooling the upper part of the cabinet and equalizing the temperature in the drawers. While zero temperature differential between the drawers is desired, a five or six degree temperature variance, for example three degrees plus or minus from the target temperature, is generally an acceptable working temperature differential. Empirical tests have found that maximum temperature differences between the two drawers is 2.4° F. when the external ambient temperature is approximately 90° F. and a target cooling temperature is about 36-38° F., with the mean temperature differential being even better at 1.2° F. Because the test results may vary depending on the temperature of the food inside the drawers, for consistency the test were conducted with the refrigerator completely unloaded. Individual units tested under the same conditions achieved a nearly zero degree differential, for example 0.4° F., which is expected to improve and be at or very near zero with lower ambient temperatures (near 70° F.) common in homes and business environments. A primary benefit of this uniform temperature afforded by the refrigerator of the present invention is that, in non-freezer applications, the temperature can be set to a target temperature which approaches freezing, for example 34-36° F. with the actual temperatures within the drawer at the high end being sufficiently cool and the lower end actual temperatures remaining above freezing.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The refrigeration system is operated and controlled by a control unit <b>200</b> mounted in the interior of the upper drawer <b>26</b> (preferably in the left front corner). The control unit <b>200</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, has an LED display <b>202</b> providing actual and set temperature readings and has temperature adjustment buttons, preferably in the form of warmer <b>204</b> and cooler <b>206</b> sealed buttons. The control unit <b>200</b> could also have indicator lights (not shown) providing the user or service technician visual indication of refrigeration error conditions or cycle status.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, the present invention provides a pull-out drawer type refrigerator with several features to improve ease of use and functionality. The sliding bottle bin provides extra storage for wine or like bottles without hampering access to the items stored in the associated drawer bin. The side access compartment also provides additional storage space in a pull out bin that is easily accessible from either side or the top of the associated drawer. The adjustable fence quickly and easily compartmentalizes the drawer bins for segregated storage of items and can be used to secure taller items in place to prevent tipping. The size of the compartments can be adjusted easily by turning the locking knob and sliding the dividers as desired. The dividers can be slid near perpendicular walls of the drawer bin or removed completely when there is no need to divide up the storage space. Finally, the invention provides for nearly constant and equal temperatures at the drawer bins of multiple pull-out drawers using a single partitioned naturally convective evaporator.</p>
