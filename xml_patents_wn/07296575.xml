<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) from provisional U.S. patent application No. 60/527,235 filed Dec. 5, 2003 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to a headgear adapted to support an object on the head of a user, and, more particularly, to a headgear having a beam that spans the nape of a patient's neck or back of the head for attaching an object to a patient while minimizing the amount of structure that overlies the user's hair, and to an interface assembly and pressure support system that includes such a headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are numerous situations where it is necessary to couple an object to the face of a user. For example, non-invasive ventilation and pressure support therapies involve the placement of a patient interface device, which is typically a nasal mask that covers the nose, a nasal/oral mask that covers the nose and mouth, or full face mask that covers the patient face, on the face of a patient. The patient interface device interfaces the ventilator or pressure support device with the airway of the patient, so that a flow of breathing gas can be delivered from the pressure/flow generating device to the airway of the patient. Typically, non-invasive ventilation involves providing ventilatory gas to the airway of a patient without intubating the patient or surgically inserting a tracheal tube in their esophagus. Pressure support therapies involve providing a pressure, such as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or variable airway pressure, which varies with the patient's respiratory cycle (bi-level pressure support) or with the condition of the patient (auto-titrating pressure support), to treat a medical disorder, such as sleep apnea syndrome, in particular, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or congestive heart failure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known to maintain such masks on the face of a wearer by a headgear having upper and lower straps, each having opposite ends threaded through connecting elements provided on the opposite sides and top of a mask. Because such masks are typically worn for an extended period of time, it is important the headgear maintain the mask in a tight enough seal against a patient's face without discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One such headgear is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,517,986 (“the '986 patent”), which is assigned to Respironics, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pa., the assignee of the present application. The headgear taught by the '986 patent includes a cap-like headpiece adapted to fit the crown and back of a patient's head. Lower straps provide a two-point connection with a gas delivery mask. Straps depending from the headpiece are connected to and moveable relative to the lower straps. Additionally, a pair of upper straps can be used to provide a four-point connection with the gas delivery mask if needed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another such headgear also manufactured by Respironics, Inc. includes five straps extending in a star-like manner from a rear joining piece, which is positionable along the rear portion of a patient's head. The three uppermost straps are adapted to fit on the patient's head. A center top strap extends from the joining piece across the top of the patient's head to the patient's forehead. Upper side straps, which are provided on either side of the top strap, extend from the joining piece along the sides of a patient's head above the ears to attach to the top strap at the patient's forehead. The top strap includes a pair of elongated openings through which the upper side straps are threaded.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">All of the straps in the headgear taught by the '986 patent include two components of a hook and loop fastener, such as VELCRO®. The exterior of the straps include a loop fastener portion, and a hook fastener tab portion is attached to the end of each strap. When securing or fastening, the end of each the upper side strap is bent back on itself to adhere the hook fastener tab portion to the exterior of the straps including the loop fastener portion. More specifically, the hook fastener tab portion of the top strap is adapted to be threaded through a connecting element of the gas delivery mask and then bent back on itself to adhere the hook fastener tab portion to the exterior loop fastener portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another headgear is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,965, which is also assigned to Respironics, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pa., the assignee of the present application. The headgear of U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,965 includes a load bearing ear piece that encircles each ear of the user. Two head bands connect the ear pieces to one another. One headband extends behind the head, and the other headband extends over the head.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other conventional headgear provide a convenient attachment of the patient interface device to the user's head. However, they suffer from several disadvantages. For example, conventional headgear straps cover significant portions of the user's head, including his or her hair. The present inventors recognized that some users prefer to avoid significant contact between their hair and the headgear. Contact between the headgear straps and the user's hair, for example, can result in entanglement of the straps with the hair, making the headgear difficult, and perhaps painful to remove. Thus, some users prefer that the headgear straps not cross over the hair. Therefore, a need exists for a headgear that is easy to use and adjust, is comfortable, provides a stable support for the object being attached to the user, and does not rest significantly on his or her hair.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, some conventional headgear are perceived as bulky or cumbersome in that they cover a substantial area of the user's head. Furthermore, some users have an aversion to the relatively unattractive appearance of conventional headgear, and may prefer headgear that look less like a medical apparatus. Therefore, a need exists for a headgear that does not cover much of the patient's head so that it is perceived as being lightweight and slim and that appears less like a medical device. Because conventional headgear are soft, floppy, and typically have a myriad of flexible straps, the straps and other portions of the mask can become entangled. Therefore, a further need exists for a headgear that is easier to use in that it is less likely to become tangled in itself.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a headgear that overcomes the shortcomings of conventional headgear. This object is achieved according to one embodiment of the present invention by providing a headgear for attaching an object to a head of a user that includes a beam having a central portion, a first end portion, and a second end portion. The beam provides all of the force needed to secure such an object to a head of a user. The central portion wraps around a back of the neck or head and remains below the external occipital protuberance such that the first end portion is located proximate to the right side of the head and the second end portion is located proximate to the left side of the head. A first ear loop is coupled to the first end portion of the beam, and a second ear loop is coupled to the second end portion of the beam. The first ear loop includes a first upper arm adapted to be positioned above an ear, a first lower arm adapted to be positioned below the ear, or both. A second ear loop includes a second upper arm adapted to be positioned above the ear, a second lower arm adapted to be positioned below the user's ear, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">By providing a headgear that is disposed across the back of the head or neck, the headgear of the present invention avoids placing the straps over much of the patient's hair. The use of a beam with ear loops attached thereto that provide attachment points at both ears provides a relatively stable platform for supporting virtually any object on a patient's face. The present invention further provides a headgear that is comfortable to the patient, fits a wide range of head sizes, and provides improved aesthetics and usability.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an interface assembly and a system for delivering a breathing gas to a patient that uses the headgear of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other objects, features, and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structure and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. As used in the specification and in the claims, the singular form of “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> schematically illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a portion of a headgear <b>30</b> according to the principles of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a patient <b>32</b> wearing an interface assembly, generally indicated at <b>34</b>, including a mask <b>36</b> and headgear <b>30</b>. Headgear <b>30</b> includes a beam <b>38</b>, that is preferably rigid or semi-rigid, having a central portion <b>40</b>, a first end portion <b>42</b>, and a second end portion <b>44</b>. Central portion <b>40</b> wraps around a back of a user's neck or head and remains below the user's external occipital protuberance, which is generally indicated at <b>45</b> and is typically located at the back of the skull near the bottom where the head meets the neck. When properly positioned on the patient, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for example, first end portion <b>42</b> of beam <b>38</b> is located proximate to the right side the patient's head and second end portion <b>44</b> is located proximate to the left side of the head. By providing a beam that terminates behind the user's ear, the headgear distributes the holding force on the nape of the neck.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Beam <b>38</b> provides a first force, generally indicated by arrow A, that urges the patient interface device <b>36</b> against the user's face. First force A represents all of the force needed to secure an object, such as mask <b>36</b>, on the head of the user, and counterbalances a second force, as generally indicated by arrow B, which represents the pulling force of the patient interface device on the user. At all times during use of the interface assembly of the present invention, all portions of the beam <b>38</b> that provide first force A, which resists or counterbalances second force B, remains below the user's external occipital protuberance, so that no portions of the beam are above the user's external occipital protuberance during normal use of the headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">This configuration for the present invention provides two advantages. First, it allows the headgear to securely attach an object of the face of the user without the need for a strap above the external occipital protuberance. This minimizes the area where the headgear overlaps the user's hair. Second, this configuration allows forces A and B to be effectively directed through the user's ear, without having any portion of the headgear overlie the ear, which tends to be quite uncomfortable. Directing the interface securing force through the user's ear provides the most direct path for attaching an object on the face of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Beam <b>38</b> can have a variety of shapes, sizes, and configurations so long as it provides the desired load supporting function and is comfortable for the patient and remains below the user's external occipital protuberance at all times during use of the headgear. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-2</figref>, beam <b>38</b> is defined by a pair of beam members <b>46</b><i>a </i>and <b>46</b><i>b </i>separated by a gap <b>48</b>. Beam members <b>46</b><i>a </i>and <b>46</b><i>b </i>define lower upper and lower portions of the beam, respectively, and join one another at the first end portion and the second end portion of the beam. This multi-beam configuration is advantageous in that it distributes the load supported by the beam over a relatively large area at the nape of the neck. However, a single beam member configuration is also contemplated by the present invention, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. Of course, beam members in excess of two are also contemplated by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The overall height of beam <b>38</b> is large enough to distribute the load over an area that is large enough to provide a comfortable load on the patient, yet small enough so as not to significantly impede the user's ability to articulate his or her head. The present invention also contemplates that the interior surface of beam <b>38</b>, the overall shape of the beam, or a combination thereof can be contoured so as to more closely correspond to the surface of the patient or to correspond to the underlying bone structure, thereby maximizing patient comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A first ear loop <b>50</b> is coupled to first end portion <b>42</b> of beam <b>38</b>, and a second ear loop <b>52</b> is coupled to second end portion <b>44</b> of the beam. The first and second ear loops are preferably joined to the beam in a fixed relation, i.e., so that either ear loop does not move relative to the end portion of the beam to which it is attached. First ear loop <b>50</b> includes a first upper arm <b>54</b><i>a </i>that is positioned above an ear of a user when the headgear is properly located on the user, and a first lower arm <b>54</b><i>b </i>that is positioned below the user's ear. Similarly, second ear loop <b>52</b> includes a second upper arm <b>56</b><i>a </i>that is positioned above the ear of the user, and a second lower arm <b>56</b><i>b </i>that is positioned below the ear. The upper and lower arms on each ear loop provide mountings to which headgear straps or other suitable connecting elements are attached for securing an object to be affixed to a patient's face to headgear <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First and second ear loops <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> can have a variety of shapes, sizes, and configurations. In a presently preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, the first and second ear loops are semi-circular and are integrally formed with the beam so that the combination of the ear loops and the beam define a unitary structure. The semi-circular or crescent shape provides a stable support on the side of the head and provides an area that is sized and shaped so as to receive the user's ear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Upper and lower arms <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, and <b>56</b><i>b </i>are also preferably integral with the first and second ear loops. The overall size of the ear loops and arms should be large enough to achieve the desired support and mounting functions, yet small enough to minimize the area of contact on the user's head. The present invention also contemplates that the interior surface of first and second ear loops <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> and upper and lower arms <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, and <b>56</b><i>b</i>, the overall shape of these items, or a combination thereof can be contoured so as to more closely correspond to the surface of the patient or to correspond to the underlying bone structure, thereby maximizing patient comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Beam <b>38</b>, first and second ear loops <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, and upper and lower arms <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, and <b>56</b><i>b </i>in this first exemplary embodiment are preferably formed so that the overall structure is rigid or semi-rigid. For present purposes, “semi-rigid” means that these structures retain their shape when no load is applied on them, but flex to some degree to allow them to conform to the patient to reduce pressure points when a load is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, forming the beam, first and second ear loops, and upper and lower arms as a rigid or semi-rigid structure is accomplished by forming one or more of these structures from a support member <b>58</b> that is rigid or semi-rigid and providing a cushion member <b>60</b> disposed on a user contacting side of the support member. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Examples of suitable rigid or semi-rigid materials suitable for use as support member <b>58</b> include metals (preferably a light-weight metal), plastics, or laminated fibers, or any combination thereof, such as a plastic reinforced with metal supports. Examples of materials suitable for use as cushion member <b>60</b> include, foam, cloth, silicon, rubber, or any combination thereof. The present invention also contemplates that the rigid or semi-rigid nature of the beam, first and second ear loops, and upper and lower arms can be accomplished in any conventional manner, such as by providing stiffened fabric. Stiffening the fabric can be accomplished, for example, by providing a rigid or semi-rigid support or batten in the fabric and/or coating, laminating, or otherwise reinforcing the fabric with a stiffening agent, such as through screen printing process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The support member and the cushion material are joined in any conventional manner, such as by adhering the cushion to the support member. It is to be understood that the present invention contemplates selectively attaching the support member and the cushion material so that they can be detached from one another as needed. This is desirable, for example, for cleaning purposes. It also allows customization of the headgear by allowing the user to mix and match the cushion material and the support member. The present invention also contemplates that other structures can be provided on support member <b>58</b> and/or cushion member <b>60</b>. For example, a protective covering (not shown) can be provided on either of these items.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An alternative embodiment of the present invention contemplates that first and second ear loops <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are formed as rigid or semi-rigid structures and that beam <b>38</b> is not. This embodiment contemplates that the beam is a flexible member, such as piece of fabric material, that secures the first and second ear loops to one another. Dashed line <b>63</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> illustrate one possible point of delineation between the rigid or semi-rigid first and second ear loops and the beam portion of the headgear, which can be rigid, semi-rigid, or completely flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As noted above, upper and lower arms <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>a</i>, and <b>56</b><i>b </i>of first and second ear loops <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> define a mounting member to which additional structures, such as straps, attach. These additional structures are needed to attach an object on a face of a user using headgear <b>30</b>. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, these additional structures are flexible straps that connect to the object to be attached on the patient. More specifically, the present invention contemplates providing a first upper strap portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>coupled to first upper arm <b>54</b><i>a </i>and a first lower strap portion <b>62</b><i>b </i>coupled to first lower arm <b>54</b><i>b</i>. Similar straps can be coupled to second upper and lower arms <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>associated with second ear loop <b>52</b>. The user interface device to be attached to the user, such as the mask, headgear <b>30</b>, and the connecting straps define the interface assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, straps <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>and the straps on the other side of the headgear (not shown) connect to various locations on mask <b>36</b> to hold the mask on the user's face. It can be appreciated that the connecting straps can attach to the user interface device in any one of an almost infinite number of configurations. Preferably, they are located so as to provide a secure attachment to the interface device and a stable support for this device on the user, while also maximizing patient comfort, for example, by avoiding overlapping sensitive areas such as the ears or eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The straps connected to headgear <b>30</b> can be formed from a variety of materials, or combination of materials, and can have a variety of shapes, sizes, mechanical properties, and configurations. For example, the present invention contemplates that the straps are formed from a soft material (at least on the patient contacting side) and that the straps are slightly flexible. The present invention also contemplates that the attachment point for the straps on the upper and/or lower arms and the attachment points on the interface device can be fixed or adjustable, and can be selectively detachable. For example, the straps can be rotatably attached to headgear <b>30</b>, the interface device (such as mask <b>36</b>), or both. In addition, the straps can be connected to the headgear, interface device, or both via a snap so that the straps can be detached and reattached from headgear <b>30</b> or the interface device at the user's convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the interface assembly includes headgear <b>30</b>, the straps, and an interface device that couples a gas delivery conduit <b>64</b>, typically referred to as a patient circuit, to an airway of the patient. Patient circuit <b>64</b> is typically a flexible tube that includes an attachment where it joins patient interface device <b>36</b>. It should be noted that patient interface device <b>36</b> can be any conventional patient interface device, including a nasal mask, oral mask, nasal/oral mask, full face mask, nasal cannula, or any other device that interfaces with an airway of a patient. As schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, patient circuit <b>64</b> communicates a flow of gas from a gas flow generating device <b>66</b>, such as a conventional pressure support system or ventilator, so that gas is delivered from the gas flow generator to the airway of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Gas flow generating device <b>66</b> can be any conventional device that accomplishes this function, such as a CPAP device, bi-level device, auto-titrating device, or any other pressure support system or ventilator using any conventional mode of therapy delivery. Although patient circuit <b>64</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as being a single limb circuit, the present invention contemplates that the patient circuit can include multiple limbs and can include other elements, such as filters, exhaust ports, flow control valve, pressure relief valves, humidifiers, and sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a headgear <b>68</b> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Headgear <b>68</b> is similar to headgear <b>30</b> in many respects. However, headgear <b>68</b> illustrates several optional features that are believed to make the headgear easier to use and more comfortable for a wider variety differently sized and shaped patients.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, headgear <b>68</b> includes a first ear loop <b>70</b> and a second ear loop <b>72</b> that are rotatably coupled to first end portion <b>42</b>′ and second end portion <b>44</b>′, respectively, of beam <b>38</b>′. This rotatable attachment can be provided in any one of a variety of techniques. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, an axis <b>74</b> is provided on each end portion of the beam about which the ear loop rotates, as indicated, for example, by arrow C. Other techniques for allowing the ear loop to move relative to the beam include a sliding channel configuration, where the ear loop slides along a path relative to the beam by providing, for example, a tongue and groove or slot and pin, configuration that allows the ear loop to move relative to the beam, yet remain attached thereto. By allowing the ear loops to rotate relative to the beam, the headgear is able to self-align to a proper position on the patient so that one headgear size or style will fit a larger number of patients with the same degree of comfort that would otherwise require multiple headgear choices.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another feature of headgear <b>68</b> is the ability to adjust the distance between first ear loop <b>70</b> and second ear loop <b>72</b> along a length of beam <b>38</b>′. That is an adjusting mechanism associated with the first ear loop, the second ear loop or both is provided so that the first or second ear loops can be moved along the beam, as indicated, for example, by arrow D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this illustrated exemplary embodiment, this transverse adjustability made possible by providing an alternative axis <b>76</b> or mounting member to which the ear loop can selectively attach. To adjust the ear loops in the transverse direction (corresponding to arrow D) thereby effectively changing the length of beam <b>38</b>, the first and/or second ear loop is detached from one axis and reattached to the other axis. This configuration provides flexibility in the size and configuration for the headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate a headgear <b>78</b> that includes yet another technique for adjusting the distance between a first ear loop <b>80</b> and a second ear loop <b>82</b>. In this embodiment, headgear <b>78</b> includes a beam, generally indicated at <b>84</b>, that has a length adjusting capability rather than adjusting the attachment location for the ear loops. Of course, the present invention contemplates providing the beam length adjustment capability in combination with the ear loop position adjustment capability. Other than providing a length adjustment capability, beam <b>84</b> corresponds to beam <b>38</b>, <b>38</b>′ from the previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Adjusting the length of beam <b>84</b> is made possible, according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, by separating beam <b>84</b> into a first beam member <b>86</b> and a second beam member <b>88</b> that are selectively connectable to one another at a number of different overlapping positions. That is, the first beam member and the second beam member are connectable such that the degree of overlap of these two members can be changed, thereby effectively changing the length of the beam. In this embodiment, a plurality of engaging portions or protrusions are provided on one beam member and a plurality of receiving portions are provided on the other beam member. The length of the beam is controlled based on the selection of which engaging portions are coupled to associated receiving portions. It is to be understood that this specific implementation represents only one of a variety of techniques that can be used to change the amount of overlap between the two beam members.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a front perspective view of a fourth embodiment of a headgear <b>90</b> according to the principles of the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the previous embodiments except that upper and lower arms <b>54</b><i>a</i>′ and <b>54</b><i>b</i>′ of first ear loop <b>50</b>′ and upper and lower arms <b>56</b><i>a</i>′ and <b>56</b><i>b</i>′ of second ear loop <b>52</b>′ are adjustable. That is, the distance between upper arms <b>54</b><i>a</i>′, <b>56</b><i>a</i>′ and lower arms <b>54</b><i>b</i>′ and <b>56</b><i>b</i>′ associated with each ear loop can be changed, as indicated by arrow E. This feature of the present invention allows the headgear to be customized to the physical dimensions of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, an adjusting mechanism <b>92</b> that allows the distance between the upper arms and the lower arms to be changed is similar to that discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. For example, in this embodiment, engaging portions or protrusions are provided on upper arms <b>54</b><i>a</i>′, <b>56</b><i>a</i>′ and corresponding receiving portions are provided on lower arms <b>54</b><i>b</i>′ and <b>56</b><i>b</i>′, or vice versa. It to be understood, however, that the present invention contemplates that any technique that allows the distance between the upper arms and the lower arms to be changed can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a side view of a patient <b>32</b> wearing a second embodiment of an interface assembly <b>94</b> according to the principles of the present invention. In this embodiment, interface assembly includes headgear <b>30</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. However, the interface device for use with headgear <b>30</b> is not a nasal mask. Instead, the interface device is a patient monitoring device <b>96</b> that is attached to the face of the patient so as to monitor a parameter of the patient, such as patient airflow.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is to be understood that the number, type, size, function, and other characteristics of the objects that can be used as the patient interface device that are suitable for use with a headgear of the present invention are nearly limitless. For example, the present invention contemplates that the headgear of the present invention can be used to attach other medical devices to the patient, such as a spirometer or other monitor, to the patient. On the other hand, the headgear can also be used to attach non-medical devices to the face of the user, such as gas masks, cosmetic objects, electronic devices, or apparel. No attempt is made in this disclosure to list the different types of objects that can serve as interface devices that can be held on the head of the patient by the headgear of the present invention. The monitoring device and headgear arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are provided merely as an example of other configurations for the interface device that are suitable for use therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a fifth embodiment of a headgear <b>100</b> according to the principles of the present invention. In this embodiment, headgear <b>100</b> includes a beam <b>102</b> and first and second ear loops <b>104</b> (only one of which is shown). The nature, structure, and possible configurations for the beam and the ear loops in this embodiment and the interconnection between these members corresponds to that discussed above. For example, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention contemplates forming the ear loops as a rigid or semi-rigid structure and the beam as a rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible structure attached in a fixed relation to the ear loops. In this embodiment, the ear loop includes only a lower arm <b>106</b>, so that no structure is located above the user's ear. Straps <b>108</b> attach the object to be held on the patient's face, such as a mask <b>110</b>, to the ear loop portions of headgear <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a sixth embodiment of a headgear <b>112</b> according to the principles of the present invention. In this embodiment, headgear <b>112</b> includes a beam <b>114</b> and first and second ear loops <b>116</b> (only one of which is shown). Again, the nature, structure, and possible configurations for the beam and the ear loops in this embodiment and the interconnection between these members corresponds to that discussed above. For example, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention contemplates forming the ear loops as a rigid or semi-rigid structure and the beam as a rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible structure attached in a fixed relation to the ear loops. In this embodiment, the ear loop includes only an upper arm <b>118</b>, so that no structure is located above the user's ear. Straps <b>108</b> attach the object to be held on the patient's face, such as a mask <b>110</b>, to the ear loop portions of headgear <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a side perspective view of a further embodiment of patient interface assembly <b>120</b> according to the principles of the present invention. The patient interface assembly includes a headgear <b>122</b>, an object <b>124</b> to be attached to the user's face (which in this exemplary embodiment is a mask), and an attaching mechanism <b>126</b> for attaching object <b>124</b> to headgear <b>122</b>. One of the unique aspects of this embodiment resides in this attaching mechanism. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the attaching mechanism associated with one side of the headgear, it is to be understood that a similar attaching mechanism can be provided on the other side of the headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Attaching mechanism <b>126</b> includes a single length of fastening material, such as a cord or strap, that is fed back and forth between headgear <b>122</b> and mask <b>124</b> through fastening elements on the mask and headgear. More specifically, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, a first portion <b>128</b> of the fastening material is fixed to upper arm <b>130</b> and extends to a first portion of mask <b>124</b> where it is looped through a first fastening element <b>132</b> on the mask so that a second portion <b>134</b> extends back to the headgear. A third portion <b>136</b> of the fastening material is threaded through one or more guides <b>138</b> so that a fourth portion <b>140</b> extends from a lower arm <b>141</b> to the mask, is looped through a second fastening element <b>142</b> on the mask, and provides an attaching portion <b>144</b> that extends back to the headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The fastening material is allowed to slide in first fastening element <b>132</b>, guides <b>138</b>, and second fastening element <b>142</b> so that increasing the tension on attaching portion <b>144</b> increases the tension on the mask at the first and the second fastening elements. This configuration allows the tension between the mask and the headgear to be effectively adjusted at two locations, i.e., the upper and lower arms, by pulling on one element, namely attaching portion <b>144</b>. Once the desired tension is achieved, an attaching element <b>146</b> provided on attaching portion is secured to the headgear. For example, the present invention contemplates attaching portion <b>144</b> to headgear <b>120</b> by means of a hook and loop attachment device, where one element is provided on attaching element <b>146</b> and the other element is provided on beam <b>148</b>. Of course, any conventional fastening technique can be used to secure the attaching portion of the attaching mechanism to the headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be further understood that the present invention contemplates that the winding pattern by which the fastening material is attached to and between the headgear and the object to be attached to the patient can have a variety of different configurations. For example, more runs back and forth between the headgear and mask can be provided. The fastening material can cross between the sides of the patient interface assembly. The attaching portion can be attached to the mask. A single fastening material running between the sides of the mask can be provided, so that the user need only apply tension on one attaching portion to adjust the tension at multiple locations on the mask. The present invention contemplates, for example, eliminating first portion <b>128</b> of attaching element <b>146</b> so that the end of the attaching element is connected to the patient interface device rather than the headgear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Thus, the first run for the attaching elements is attaching portion <b>134</b> running from the mask to the headgear.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It can be appreciated from the foregoing description that the present invention contemplates other shapes, sizes, and configurations for the interface assembly and, in particular, for the headgear and interface device defining the interface assembly. In addition, the straps or other connecting elements that are used to couple the headgear and interface device are also subject to variations. For example, straps need not be attached to both the upper and lower arms, but can be provided on either the upper arm or the lower arm depending on the specific arrangement needed to properly position the interface device on the head of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">By providing a headgear that is disposed across the back of the head or neck, the headgear of the present invention avoids placing the straps over much of the patient head and hair. The use of a beam with ear loops attached thereto that provide attachment points at both ears provides a relatively stable platform for supporting virtually any object on a patient's face. In addition, because the headgear does not cover much of the patient's head, it is perceived as being lightweight and slim and that appears less like a medical device, i.e., more aesthetically pleasing. In addition the use of the beam with ear loops provides a headgear that is less likely to become tangled in itself.</p>
