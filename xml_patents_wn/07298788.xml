<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to wireless communication systems, and, more specifically to wireless communication systems using various modulation techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gaussian minimum shift keying (“GMSK”) is a popular modulation technique due to its simplicity and bandwidth efficiency. A popular technique for generating GMSK signals is “direct modulation” in which the modulation is performed directly in the frequency synthesizer. However, one drawback of direct modulation is that it is difficult to maintain adequate control over the modulation index and the filter bandwidth because of variations in the analog circuitry and the effects of tuning the synthesizer to different center frequencies. Designing a transmitter that can maintain a near-ideal minimum shift keying (“MSK”) modulation index (e.g., by generating the baseband modulation in a digital signal processor) generally results in additional cost, complexity and power consumption. Thus, a demodulator for which performance is insensitive to modulation index is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one embodiment, the invention provides a communication system that can include a first device transmitting a modulated signal and a second device receiving the modulated signal. The second device can include a first demodulator, a second demodulator and an error detection module. The first demodulator can receive the modulated signal, produce a first demodulated output, and implement a first demodulation technique. The second demodulator can receive the modulated signal, produce a second demodulated output, and implement a second demodulation technique that is different from the first demodulation technique. The error detection module can perform bit error detection based on the first demodulated output and the second demodulated output.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of transferring information via radio frequency. The method can include converting information to a digital signal, modulating the digital signal to a modulated signal using a packetized protocol, and wirelessly transferring the modulated signal. The method can also include receiving the modulated signal, demodulating the modulated signal to produce a demodulated signal, and implementing an error detection algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method for performing estimations of modulation signal parameters upon reception of a transmitted signal. The method can include demodulating the transmitted signal to produce a digital signal having a plurality of bits, storing the plurality of bits in an array, determining if the array contains a first pattern of bits or a second pattern of bits, and performing a modulation signal parameter estimation if the array contains a first pattern of bits or a second pattern of bits.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of adapting the output of an equalizer in a communication system. The method can include receiving an input signal, determining a first output value during a first time interval of the input signal and determining a second output value during a second time interval of the input signal based in part on the first output value determined during the first time interval. The first time interval can precede the second time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of estimating the carrier offset of a modulated signal. The method can include receiving a input signal having a first input value during a first time interval and a second input value during a second time interval, receiving a first estimated parameter of the input signal and receiving a second estimated parameter of the input signal. The method can also include calculating an estimated signal during the second time interval, combining the second input value of the input signal with the estimated signal to produce an error signal and determining the carrier offset during the second time interval based in part on the error signal. The estimated signal may be a substantially noiseless estimation of the second input value during the second time interval of the input signal, and the estimated signal may be based in part on the first input value of the input signal, the first estimated parameter and the second estimated parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the following description, claims and drawings.</p>

As such, it should be noted that a plurality of hardware and software based devices, as well as a plurality of different structural components may be utilized to implement the invention.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a communication system <b>20</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. The communication system <b>20</b> includes a transmitter <b>25</b> and a receiver <b>28</b>. The receiver <b>28</b> can include a receiver front-end <b>30</b> and a baseband receiver <b>35</b>. The transmitter <b>25</b> receives payload data (e.g., data to be transmitted) from a data source <b>40</b>. The transmitter <b>25</b> modulates the payload data with a modulation technique [e.g., minimum shift keying (“MSK”) modulation, Gaussian minimum shift keying (“GMSK”) modulation, frequency shift keying (“FSK”) modulation, differential frequency shift keying (“differential FSK”) modulation, or Gaussian frequency shift keying (“GFSK”) modulation], and transmits the modulated signal to the receiver <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the transmitter <b>25</b> can encode payload data according to a packetized protocol or packet-orientated protocol and can modulate the resulting bit stream using GFSK modulation to produce the modulated signal s(t). In an exemplary implementation, the transmitter <b>25</b> acquires ECG data, which can be filtered and transmitted to the receiver <b>28</b> at a rate of approximately 120-samples per second. The transmitter <b>25</b> sends the data out at a rate of approximately 10-Kbps in a protocol which specifies 125-packets per second. Each packet of data can contain one of the 120-Hz samples acquired by the transmitter <b>25</b>. This may result in only 120 of the 125 packets per second contain the acquired ECG data and that the remaining packets may not contain any data. In one exemplary implementation, the remaining five packets do not contain any data and are referred to as “blank packets.” Blank packets may have unique identifiers, may be grouped together in time and may be periodic.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the packetized protocol organizes data to be transmitted per second into 120 packets, labeling the first data packet as data packet <b>0</b> (“DP<b>0</b>”) and the last data packet as data packet <b>119</b> (“DP<b>119</b>”). The data packets in between data packet DP<b>0</b> and DP<b>119</b> are labeled accordingly. Data packets DP<b>0</b> through DP<b>119</b> are arranged in sequential and consecutive order. A series of five consecutive blank data packets [blank packet <b>0</b> (“BP<b>0</b>”) through blank packet <b>4</b> (“BP<b>4</b>”)] are positioned after the last data packet DP<b>119</b> in the modulated signal s(t). The burst of five blank data packets BP<b>0</b> through BP<b>4</b> occur once per second. In other embodiments, the total number of data packets and/or blank packets differ from the first embodiment and/or the packetized protocol may organize the data into a different pattern of data packets and blank packets.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the receiver <b>28</b> can receive the first blank packet BP<b>0</b> and can estimate the time period until the next group of blank packets. In general, estimation of the time period or required interval, as opposed to certain knowledge of that interval, is considered because of pipeline delays in the receiver, the values of which need not be constant. After the estimated time period elapses, the receiver <b>28</b> may stop demodulating the incoming signal and perform system calculations, such as, for example, switching through all of the antenna fields if applicable and estimating the signal power. for each. In some embodiments, the packetized protocol allows the receiver <b>28</b> to implement a method of error detection and correction through the use of parallel demodulators, as will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. the modulated signal s(t) can be transmitted through a transmission channel <b>45</b> where the signal s(t) is attenuated and corrupted by additive noise. In one embodiment, the receiver front-end <b>30</b> can receive the attenuated and corrupted modulated signal, now the received signal r(t), and can amplify the received signal r(t). In one embodiment, the received signal r(t) is down-converted to baseband in-phase and quadrature components after the signal r(t) is amplified. These baseband components can be digitized and resampled synchronous to the bit stream to yield a discrete-time complex baseband signal r[i].</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the receiver front-end <b>30</b> can output the baseband signal r[i] to the baseband receiver <b>35</b>.

In some embodiments, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> can perform various and multiple demodulation techniques in order to produce the output payload data <b>42</b>, which can be the payload data acquired from a data source <b>40</b> and transmitted by the transmitter <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The communication system <b>20</b> can be used in a number of wireless communication applications and systems, such as, for example, telemetry systems, cellular telephone systems, satellite transmissions, etc. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the communication system <b>20</b> is included in a telemetry system <b>50</b>. The telemetry system <b>50</b> includes a telemetry unit <b>65</b> that acquires and monitors patient data from an ambulatory patient <b>60</b>. In this embodiment, the payload data is the data acquired from the patient.

The transmitter <b>85</b> can transmit the modulated signal s(t) over a transmission channel <b>45</b>.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the transmitter <b>25</b> and/or the transmitter <b>85</b>. Payload data acquired from a data source <b>40</b> can pass through an encoder <b>120</b>. The data can be encoded according to a packet-oriented protocol wherein each packet incorporates an error correcting code (“ECC”). The resulting bit stream can be output as a continuous-time rectangular waveform b(t)ε{±1}. The waveform b(t) can then be filtered by a filter <b>125</b> (e.g., a Gaussian filter) and can be subjected to a gain by a gain module <b>130</b> (e.g., an amplifier or filter). The gain applied by the gain module <b>130</b> determines the modulation index h of the resulting modulating waveform x(t). In one embodiment, the gain of the gain module <b>130</b> is chosen to produce a non-MSK modulation index h (i.e., a modulation index h of approximately 0.6).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A modulator <b>140</b> receives the waveform x(t) and outputs the modulated signal s(t). The modulator <b>140</b> includes a combiner <b>135</b> and an oscillator <b>142</b>. The waveform x(t) can then be used to modulate the frequency of a carrier signal with center frequency ω<sub>c </sub>at the combiner <b>135</b>. The output of the combiner <b>135</b> is the instantaneous frequency ω(t), which can pass through the oscillator <b>142</b>. The FM transmitter <b>25</b> can include any suitable hardware and/or software components.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the baseband receiver <b>35</b>. The baseband receiver <b>35</b> can include a first demodulator <b>205</b> using a first demodulation technique and a second demodulator <b>210</b> using a second demodulation technique that differs from the first technique. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first demodulator <b>205</b> uses an FSK demodulation technique and the second demodulator <b>210</b> uses an offset-quadrature phase shift keying (“OQPSK”) demodulation technique. The second demodulator <b>210</b> can include any suitable hardware and/or software components. In other embodiments, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> can include more demodulators than the illustrated embodiments and can include other demodulation techniques than shown and described in the illustrated embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The receiver front-end <b>30</b> can output the discrete-time complex signal r[i] to the baseband receiver <b>35</b> for demodulation by the first and second demodulators <b>205</b> and <b>210</b>. Upon input from the front-end receiver <b>30</b>, the first demodulator <b>205</b> (i.e., the FSK demodulator) can extract the instantaneous observed phase θ[i] from the discrete-time complex baseband signal r[i] for each bit interval using phase module <b>235</b> [i.e., arg(.)]. The observed phase increment φ[i] can be computed as the first-difference of the instantaneous phase θ[i] by passing the instantaneous phase θ[i−1] through a sample delay (e.g., a 1-sample delay <b>240</b>) to a combiner <b>245</b> where the instantaneous phase θ[i] (delayed by the 1-sample delay <b>240</b>) is subtracted from the subsequent instantaneous phase θ[i]. The resulting observed phase increment φ[i] can pass through a second combiner <b>250</b> where the observed phase increment φ[i] can be combined with the predicted phase increment or correction phase ψ[i] (due to a constant carrier frequency offset of the transmitter <b>25</b> with respect to the center frequency tuned by the receiver <b>28</b>). The second combiner <b>250</b> can produce an corrected phase increment φ′[i]. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the correction phase ψ[i] can be subtracted from the observed phase increment φ[i] to obtain the corrected phase increment φ′[i].</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the corrected phase increment φ′[i] can be used in various signal parameter estimation modules (e.g., a carrier offset estimation module <b>255</b>, a modulation index estimation module <b>256</b> and a bandwidth-bit-duration estimation module <b>258</b>). Every time step or interval, the corrected phase increment φ′[i] can proceed to an equalizer <b>260</b>. The equalizer <b>260</b> can be an adaptive non-linear equalizer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> according to one embodiment. The equalizer <b>260</b> can be applied to the corrected phase increment φ′[i] to obtain the equalized or differential FSK decision statistic y[i]. The adaptive equalizer <b>260</b> can receive various signal parameters to yield the equalized decision statistic y[i]. The adaptive equalizer <b>260</b> can base its output on the incoming corrected phase increment φ′[i], an estimated filter bandwidth-bit-duration parameter BT[i] and an estimated modulation index parameter h[i]. The decision module <b>270</b> can apply a decision rule (e.g., the signum function) to the equalized decision statistic y[i] as determined by the equalizer <b>260</b> to yield a final bit stream b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i]ε{±1}.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first demodulator <b>205</b> can include a carrier offset estimation module <b>255</b>, a modulation index estimation module <b>256</b>, and a bandwidth-bit-duration estimation module <b>258</b>. The carrier offset estimation module <b>255</b> can provide an estimate of the carrier offset ψ. The modulation index estimation module <b>256</b> can provide an estimate of the modulation index h, and the bandwidth-bit-duration estimation module <b>258</b> can provide an estimate of the filter bandwidth BT. In some embodiments, the carrier offset estimation module <b>255</b>, the modulation index estimation module <b>256</b> and the bandwidth-bit-duration estimation module <b>258</b> can be used internally by the receivers <b>28</b> and <b>90</b> and can be used for system diagnostic purposes. The estimations provided by the estimation modules <b>255</b>, <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> can be trended, reported and/or displayed over a predetermined time period. An out-of-range parameter or estimation may indicate a fault and may trigger an analysis of the transmitter <b>25</b> and localize hardware errors of the transmitter <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the adaptive nonlinear equalizer <b>260</b>. The equalizer <b>260</b> can shift the corrected phase increment φ′[i] based on the previous bit decision b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−1] to reduce the probability of error using knowledge of the GFSK differential phase trellis. It is apparent from the unequalized corrected phase increment φ′ eye pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> that, without equalization, bit errors are likely to occur when the transmitter <b>25</b> transmits either one of the following: a first pattern of bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i, i+1, i+2]=[1 −1 1] or a second pattern of bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i, i+1, i+2]=[−1 1 −1]. The first pattern of bits and the second pattern of bits result in the smallest eye opening as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The equalizer <b>260</b> can utilize the fact that not all phase increments are allowed at every bit time. In particular, the smallest-magnitude positive phase increment can never occur when the preceding bit was a positive one (1), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Similarly, the smallest-magnitude negative phase increment can never occur when the preceding bit was a negative one (−1), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Accordingly, by shifting the decision statistic y[i] by shift γ at every bit instant to re-center the four known possible phase increments φ about the fixed decision threshold, the equalizer <b>260</b> opens the eye and reduces the error rate. The magnitude of the shift γ is adapted based on the estimates of the modulation index h and the filter bandwidth BT according to a transfer function ƒ<sub>eg</sub>(h, BT).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the corrected phase increment φ′[i] is a first input to a combiner <b>305</b>. The output is the differential FSK decision statistic y[i], which can be sampled and sent to a delay <b>310</b>, such as a 1-sample delay. The equalizer decision module <b>315</b> implements a decision rule to the differential FSK decision statistic y[i] to produce the bit b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−1]. A gain module <b>320</b> calculates the shift (i.e., ±1) based on the preceding bit b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−1] and the shift amplitude γ calculated by the module <b>325</b>. Once calculated, the shift, which is based partly on the previous bit decision b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−1], is subtracted from the present corrected phase increment φ′[i] by the combiner <b>305</b>. As stated earlier, the output yields the differential FSK decision statistic y[i].</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the modulation index estimation module <b>256</b>. The modulation index estimation module <b>256</b> can estimate the modulation index h by detecting bit patterns that result in full frequency shift response. In one embodiment, the pattern includes a series L of contiguous, identical bits. The series L can be the memory of the modulator's Gaussian filter in bits. Although, in principle, the series L is infinite, for a filter having a 3-dB bandwidth-bit-duration product BT≧0.2, a sliding window of L=5 is an adequate approximation. For each bit b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i] that has been preceded by at least a series of L-1 bits identical to bit b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i], the magnitude of the corrected phase increment φ′ at the window's center |φ′[i−(L-1)/2]| can be used to update a smoothed estimate of the frequency deviation Δf[i] with units radians/T<sub>b </sub>where T<sub>b </sub>is the bit duration. The modulation index estimate ĥ can then be computed as ĥ=Δf[i]/π. The parameter Γ<sub>1 </sub>can determine the bandwidth of the first-order smoothing filter.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the 3-dB bandwidth-bit-duration estimation module <b>258</b>. The 3-dB bandwidth-bit-duration estimation module <b>258</b> obtains the bandwidth-bit-duration estimate {circumflex over (B)}{circumflex over (T)} by applying a transfer function ƒ<sub>BT</sub>(.) to the ratio δ[i]/ĥ[i] where δ[i] is a smoothed estimate of the minimum phase increment δ that occurs when a string of alternating bits is transmitted. The estimation of the minimum phase increment δ is very similar to that of the modulation index h, except that a pattern or series L including alternating bits is detected before the smoothed estimate is updated from |φ′[i−(L-1)/<b>2</b>]|.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>400</b> of detecting the patterns which trigger the parameter estimations (e.g., modulation index estimation, 3-dB bandwidth-bit-duration estimation, etc.). The baseband receiver <b>35</b> stores (at step <b>405</b>) L-number of bits from the bit stream b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i] in an array. In one embodiment, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> can store (at step <b>405</b>) the first sequential L-number of bits from the bit stream b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i]. In another embodiment, the baseband receiver can implement a sorting algorithm or rule, which can store (at step <b>405</b>) incoming bits into the array if the bits satisfy the algorithm. The sorting algorithm may only store the bits that are identical to the previous bits and those bits that alternate. For example, an input bit stream b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−5, i−4, i−3, i−2, i−1, i] equals [1 1 1 0 1 0]. The sorting algorithm can begin to store bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−5, i−4, i−3]=[1 1 1] in the array, because bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−5, i−4, i−3] are identical. When the sorting algorithm reaches bits b<sub>ƒsk [i −</sub>2, i−1, i]=[0 1 0], the algorithm can remove bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−5, i−4]=[1 1] from the array and can store only the remaining four bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−3, i−2, i−1, i]=[1 0 1 0], because bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−3, i−2, i−1, i] are alternating.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once L-number bits are stored (at step <b>405</b>) in the array, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> can determine (at step <b>410</b>) whether the L-number bits are identical. If the L-number bits are identical, then the modulation index estimation module <b>256</b> performs (at step <b>415</b>) the modulation index estimation as shown and described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Once the modulation index estimation module <b>256</b> performs (at step <b>415</b>) the modulation index estimation, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> clears (at step <b>420</b>) the array and the baseband receiver returns to step <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the L-number bits are not identical (at step <b>410</b>), the baseband receiver <b>35</b> can determine (at step <b>425</b>) whether the L-number bits are alternating.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another embodiment, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> can increment (at step <b>440</b>) the index [i]. The baseband receiver <b>35</b> can also store (at step <b>445</b>) the most recent bit b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i] in the array while clearing the least recent bit b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i−L] from the array. The baseband receiver <b>35</b> analyzes the array by determining (at step <b>410</b>) whether the L-number of bits are identical.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In further embodiments, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> can determine if the L-number of bits are alternating prior to determining if the L-number of bits are identical.

In some of the embodiments, the method <b>400</b> ends when there are no more incoming bits.</p>

The decision-directed estimation loop of module <b>255</b> can produce the predicted phase increment ψ[i] used for the carrier offset correction. A GMSK differential phase reconstruction module <b>505</b> having a delay D followed by a gain module <b>510</b> (e.g., an amplifier, having a gain 2ĥ[i]) can be used to reconstruct the expected noiseless corrected phase increment {circumflex over (φ)}′[i] , based at least partially on the demodulated bits b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i]. The expected noiseless corrected phase increment {circumflex over (φ)}′[i−D] can be subtracted at combiner <b>515</b> from the appropriately delayed corrected phase increment {circumflex over (φ)}′[i−D] to yield an error signal ε[i]. Before the combiner <b>515</b>, the corrected phase increment φ′ can pass through an n-sample delay <b>520</b>. The n-sample delay <b>520</b> can have a delay D to approximately match the delay of the GMSK differential phase reconstruction module <b>505</b>.

Alternatively, a symmetric linear-transversal filter or a finite impulse response (“FIR”) filter with group delay D=(L-1)/2 may be used to approximate the ideal noiseless corrected phase increment {circumflex over (φ)}′[i].

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the baseband receiver <b>35</b> includes a first demodulator <b>205</b> and a second demodulator <b>210</b>. The first demodulator <b>205</b> can use an FSK demodulation technique and the second demodulator <b>210</b> can use an OQPSK demodulation technique. The output of the second demodulator <b>210</b> (using the OQPSK demodulation technique) can be subsequently differentially encoded by an encoder <b>605</b> to correct for the inherent differential decoding that occurs in the OQPSK demodulation process. When no bit errors occur, an output bit stream b<sub>OQPSK</sub>[i] from the differential encoder <b>605</b> will substantially match an output bit stream b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i] of the first demodulator <b>205</b> (using the FSK demodulation technique).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the system <b>20</b> can include a receiver <b>28</b> utilizing parallel demodulators, such as the first and second demodulators <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and an error detection module <b>620</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for detecting errors. In some embodiments, the error detection module <b>620</b> can detect errors using the error correction code (“ECC”) in data packets encoded by the transmitter <b>25</b> using the packetized protocol. In some embodiments, the error detection module <b>620</b> can output the output payload data <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an error detection module <b>620</b>. The error detection module <b>620</b> can use the two alternate demodulator bit streams b<sub>OQPSK</sub>[i] and b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i] and a rule or algorithm for choosing the correct bit stream when the demodulator bit streams b<sub>OQPSK</sub>[i] and b<sub>ƒsk</sub>[i] disagree.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the error detection module <b>620</b> can include a packet decoding and error detection algorithm which relies on the ECC included in each packet of data. The error detection module <b>620</b> can decode the packets and rely on the ECC in the decoded packets to determine if the packet is “good” (i.e., no errors detected), “recovered” (i.e., bit errors detected and corrected) or “failed” (i.e., bit errors detected but not corrected).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the performance of the receiver <b>28</b> (which utilizes the parallel demodulators <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> and the error detection module <b>620</b>) may be relatively insensitive to frequency deviation, which may reduce the burden one the analog circuitry in the modulator to maintain adequate control of the modulator index h. For example, the choice of a non-MSK nominal modulation index h (e.g., a modulation index h of 0.6) in the transmitter <b>25</b> improves the worst cast system performance of the communication system <b>20</b> by biasing the distribution of the modulation indices h toward a flat region of the asymmetric receiver performance curve with only a slight increase in occupied bandwidth.</p>
