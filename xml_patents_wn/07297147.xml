<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to surgical instruments, and more particularly to surgical instruments used to bite out or cut portions of bone or cartilage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rongeurs are surgical instruments for the cutting away of human tissue, and most commonly, cartilage and/or bone. At present there is a need for a rongeur having a less cumbersome and less intrusive foot plate which would make the instrument safer for use in the spinal canal and about the delicate neural structures and extend the range of use of the instrument by allowing it to be used in closer proximity to those same structures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Attempts have been made in the past to provide a rongeur with a less cumbersome foot plate. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,148 issued to Worrick, III. et al. (“Worrick”) on Feb. 5, 1991 teaches a means for allowing a limited reduction of the foot plate thickness by the addition of a groove placed at the junction of the foot plate to the shaft for the purpose of relieving crossed fields of stress. However, the foot plate of Worrick is still internally cupped to maintain a cutting edge, which thus limits any further reduction in the thickness of the foot plate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Essentially flat foot plates had been in use earlier this century, but proved to be undesirable because spinal bone is markedly compressed during the biting process. When the foot plate is flat, the mass of bone bitten is forcefully compacted into the singularly cupped recess of the movable jaw such that it is extremely difficult to remove that bone after each bite.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">At present, there is also a need for a rongeur with a capacity to remain within the wound and to repeatedly bite and to store the bone bitten until all the requisite bone removal has been completed without the need to continuously remove the rongeur from the wound for the purpose of removing the bone from the instrument to clear the cutting edges. A further and related need is for a rongeur that would collect and contain all of the bitten material such that the delicate neural structures would be protected from contact with the bitten material and/or any cogenerated inadvertent debris. In this regard, any rongeur can bite more than once, but not properly. That is, one could deliberately take several small bites, each of which would fail to fill the cup in the foot plate and the singularly cupped recess of the moveable jaw, in lieu of taking one full bite. However, once the cup and the cupped recess are filled further biting is not possible. Bone may be crushed as cups that are already full approach one another, but their contents will shield any further interposed bone from the cutting edges, thus making any further bone cutting impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An example of a multibite rongeur is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,902,498 issued to Niederer on Sep. 2, 1975. Niederer teaches the use of a rongeur hollow at the tip such that it is possible to take several bites. Unfortunately, since the hollow tip is open to the wound at both ends, the further use of the instrument pushes the already bitten material out of the other end of the hollow tip and back into the depths of the surgical wound where it can cause great harm.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Finally, there is also a need for a surgical rongeur that will upon each use present a perfectly formed and razor sharp cutting edge, which will mate exactly, and close completely, to the opposed foot plate. In this regard, Niederer taught the use of a disposable cutting element but not the use of a disposable storage chamber for the cut pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Of note is U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,375 issued to Linovitz et al. on Jun. 25, 1991 which claims a modification of Niederer's teaching wherein the tip is replaceable rather than disposable, in that it requires assembly and is secured with a screw, and wherein the tip has extending from its lower surface an inverted “T” shaped portion made to be inserted into and engage with a correspondingly internally disposed inverted “T” slot within a portion of the instrument shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A further problem with the design of conventional rongeurs limiting further thinning of the foot plate so as to maintain adequate strength is that since the opening of a conventional rongeur is much greater in its capacity than the sum volume of its cuts, in the process of biting with such a rongeur, the bone is not only bitten but is further compacted under tremendous pressure, that pressure being transmitted directly to the foot plate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Conventional rongeurs by design have excursions beyond that needed to merely close the jaw completely when the rongeur is new. That is because the manufacturer must allow for the wear that will occur at the cutting edges, and yet still provide for the capacity of the instrument to still close fully later. Thus, when bone is bitten with a conventional rongeur, a force considerably greater than that necessary to cut or even compact the bone is additionally transmitted to the foot plate as the slidable member attempts further proximal migration in opposition to the foot plate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is an ultra-thin foot plate, multi-bite rongeur with an integral storage chamber and cutting element that is replaceable and disposable. The integral storage chamber and cutting element of the present invention is removably locked to a central shaft and is removably engaged to a driving member. The integral storage chamber and cutting element slides along the shaft towards a foot plate at the distal end of the shaft in response to the movement of the driving member which may be hand operated or powered by a solenoid or a pneumatic means.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The ultra-thin foot plate of the present invention is made possible by the complete absence of a cup. The foot plate shaft junction area of the present invention is designed to mitigate the stress concentration of the junction. The foot plate of the present invention need not be as thick as that of a conventional rongeur since the only force applied to it is that sufficient to actually cut the bone being bitten. During use, the integral storage chamber and cutting element is closed at its proximal end and open at its distal end terminating in an ultra-sharp cutting surface. The interior cross sectional area of the storage chamber flares in both height and width from distal to proximal. Inasmuch as the cutting element storage chamber unit is hollow, rather than cupped, and the opposed surface of the foot plate is flat, the bone bitten is always driven rearward into the chamber portion. As the storage chamber is closed while in use except for the cutting entrance, it may be used to repeatedly bite bone without the danger of the bone bitten coming free and falling into the spinal canal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the present invention has completed its task and removed all of the bone as needed, the integral storage chamber and cutting element may be removed from the shaft of the rongeur and the bitten bone may be removed from the storage chamber and made available for use, as in performing a spinal fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention allows for the clean cutting of bone or cartilage without any compaction. Further, as the cutting element of the present invention is disposable and thus always fresh and sharp, less force is required during the actual cutting of the bone. In addition, since the integrated cutting element storage chamber unit is always fresh and sharp, edge wear is not a problem and the capacity for further excursion of the cutting element towards the foot plate is unnecessary and may be completely blocked, thereby sparing damage to the foot plate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Finally, the present invention has an integrated cutting element and storage chamber unit that is truly disposable, rather than merely replaceable and requires no special assembly or the use of any tools. The integrated cutting element and storage chamber is simply placed onto the shaft whereby it is immediately locked into place by the use of the instrument itself.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the improved surgical bone rongeur <b>10</b> is shown constructed in accordance with the present invention and consists generally of a body <b>12</b> having a rear handle <b>13</b> depending at an angle from the proximal end <b>11</b> of the body <b>12</b>, and has a shaft <b>14</b> extending distally and terminating at its distal end in a foot plate <b>16</b>. A support spike <b>31</b> extends from the upper portion of the rear handle <b>13</b> as support for the area of the hand between the thumb and the first finger. Mounted on the shaft <b>14</b> is a slide drive member <b>20</b> for reciprocating movement on the shaft <b>14</b>. The slide drive member <b>20</b> has a pin <b>42</b> located at its bottom surface near its proximal end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pivoting forward handle <b>30</b> includes a lower finger grip portion <b>34</b> and an upper finger portion <b>37</b> for the fingers. The upper part of the forward handle <b>30</b> has an extension <b>33</b> with an elongated opening <b>35</b> and an aperture <b>36</b> through which passes a pivot pin <b>32</b>. Extension <b>33</b> fits into the body <b>12</b> through slot <b>19</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and is contained within the body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once the extension <b>33</b> is positioned within slot <b>19</b>, the pivot pin <b>32</b>, having a screw head <b>39</b> on one end and threads at its other end, is used to pivotally attach the forward handle <b>30</b> to the body <b>12</b>. The pivot pin <b>32</b> passes through opening <b>15</b> in one side of the body <b>12</b> through aperture <b>36</b> in the forward handle <b>30</b> and threads into threaded aperture <b>17</b> in the other side of the body <b>12</b>. The elongated opening <b>35</b> of the extension <b>33</b> surrounds the pin <b>42</b> of slide drive member <b>20</b> mounted on the shaft <b>14</b> so that the forward handle <b>30</b> engages the pin <b>42</b> and serves as the driving means for the slide drive member <b>20</b>. The forward handle <b>30</b> is attached to the body <b>12</b> at an angle to the slide drive member <b>20</b> so that when the forward handle <b>30</b> moves proximally the slide drive member <b>20</b> moves distally.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The forward handle <b>30</b> and the rear handle <b>13</b> are biased away from each other by spring means <b>40</b> and <b>40</b><i>a</i>. Spring means <b>40</b> is attached at one end to the bottom of forward handle <b>30</b> by screw <b>41</b> and spring means <b>40</b><i>a </i>has one end attached to the bottom of rear handle <b>13</b> by screw <b>43</b>. In order to interlock the two spring means <b>40</b> and <b>40</b><i>a</i>, spring means <b>40</b> has an extension piece <b>45</b> at its upper end that fits into the notch <b>46</b> of the upper end of spring means <b>40</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Once interlocked, the spring means <b>40</b> and <b>40</b><i>a </i>oppose each other to bias the forward handle <b>30</b> distally. Other spring mechanisms, internal or external, and other biasing means, including pneumatic means, may also be employed for urging the forward handle <b>30</b> distally.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the slide drive member <b>20</b> is slidably mounted to the top surface of shaft <b>14</b> within a slot <b>24</b> formed in the shaft <b>14</b> having an inverted T-shaped portion <b>25</b> into which is fitted a complementary inverted T-shaped runner <b>26</b> depending from the bottom surface of slide drive member <b>20</b>. Slot <b>24</b> extends distally from the inverted T-shaped portion <b>25</b> to form a wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a stop pin <b>60</b> depends from the distal end <b>61</b> of the bottom surface of the slide drive member <b>20</b>. The stop pin <b>60</b> serves to guide the slide drive member <b>20</b> to keep the distal end <b>61</b> of the slide drive member <b>20</b> from sliding off the shaft <b>14</b> during the operation of the rongeur <b>10</b>. The stop pin <b>60</b> is set back from the distal end <b>61</b> of the slide drive member <b>20</b> and fits within the wider portion <b>27</b> of slot <b>24</b>. The wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b> has a slot wall <b>28</b> at its distal end which catches the stop pin <b>60</b> and prevents the slide drive member <b>20</b> from sliding off the shaft <b>14</b> distally.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, on one side of the shaft <b>14</b> is a rounded aperture <b>80</b>. The rounded aperture <b>80</b> corresponds in location to a recess <b>82</b> in the top surface of shaft <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The recess <b>82</b> bisects the wider portion <b>27</b> of slot <b>24</b> and has a rounded bottom surface. Located within the recess <b>82</b> and extending from the aperture <b>80</b> is a push button assembly <b>70</b> having a large diameter, external button portion <b>76</b> and a narrow diameter portion <b>74</b> that passes through the aperture <b>80</b>. The narrow diameter portion <b>74</b> has a depression <b>75</b> with a flat bottom. The narrow diameter portion <b>74</b> terminates at its other end in a large diameter member <b>72</b> having a slightly smaller diameter than the diameter of the rounded recess <b>82</b>. The large diameter member <b>72</b> has a flattened top surface <b>73</b> so that it is flush with the top surface of the shaft <b>14</b> when the large diameter member <b>72</b> is inserted within the recess <b>82</b>. The reverse end of the large diameter member <b>72</b> has a small depression <b>77</b> for receiving the end of a coil spring <b>84</b> a shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The large diameter member <b>72</b> is placed within the recess <b>82</b>, so that the narrow diameter portion <b>74</b> crosses the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b> at a right angle and extends through the rounded aperture <b>80</b> and the external button portion <b>76</b> is external to the shaft <b>14</b>. The depression <b>75</b> in the narrow diameter portion <b>74</b> is of a sufficient depth to permit the stop pin <b>60</b> depending from the slide drive member <b>20</b> to easily pass through the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b> and over the depression <b>75</b> unobstructed by the narrow diameter portion <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Within the recess <b>82</b> is a coil spring <b>84</b> having an end that fits within the small depression <b>77</b> of the large diameter member <b>72</b>. The coil spring <b>84</b> serves to bias the large diameter member <b>72</b> so that in its biased position, the large diameter member <b>72</b> blocks the wider portion <b>27</b> of slot <b>24</b>. The large diameter member <b>72</b> has a diameter that is sufficient to prevent the stop pin <b>60</b> from sliding over it. The external button portion <b>76</b> is at its greatest extension out of the rounded opening <b>80</b> when the large diameter member <b>72</b> is in the biased position and blocks the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b>. To unblock the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b>, the user simply presses the external button portion <b>76</b> of the button assembly <b>70</b> so that the coil spring <b>84</b> compresses and the large diameter member <b>72</b> moves further into the recess <b>82</b>. When the large diameter member <b>72</b> is positioned as far into the recess <b>82</b> as possible the depression <b>75</b> of the button assembly <b>70</b> is positioned directly beneath the stop pin <b>60</b> depending from the bottom surface of the slide drive member <b>20</b> so that the stop pin <b>60</b> can pass through the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b> unobstructed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is appreciated that the rounded recess <b>82</b> may be placed at various locations along the shaft <b>14</b> so that the button assembly <b>70</b> contained therein may also be positioned at various locations along the shaft <b>14</b> beneath the slide drive member <b>20</b>. The position of the stop pin <b>60</b> depending from the slide drive member <b>20</b> may also be changed to correspond to the location of the button assembly <b>70</b> and the configuration of the slot <b>24</b> and the position of the wider portion <b>27</b> may also be modified accordingly without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the rounded recess <b>82</b> may be positioned along the shaft <b>14</b> so that it is located above the opening <b>15</b> and the threaded aperture <b>17</b> of the body <b>12</b>. In this position, the button assembly <b>70</b> in addition to controlling the displacement of the slide drive member <b>20</b> along the shaft <b>14</b> could also serve as a hinge and attachment means for the forward handle <b>30</b> replacing the pivot pin <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the shaft <b>14</b> has a pair of rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b> extending from either side of the shaft <b>14</b> which run parallel to the shaft <b>14</b>. The rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b> have a bottom flat surface <b>64</b> that is perpendicular to the sides of the shaft <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Near the distal end of the shaft <b>14</b> are forward notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> that provide a break in the continuity of the rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b>. Positioned proximal to the forward notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> are rear notches <b>69</b>,<b>71</b> which similarly provide a break in the continuity of the rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The distal end <b>61</b> of the slide drive member <b>20</b> engages a cutting/storage member <b>50</b> which is removably attached to both the shaft <b>14</b> and to the slide drive member <b>20</b>. The cutting/storage member <b>50</b> has depending sides <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> which are mirror images of each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, near the distal end of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> the depending sides <b>51</b>,<b>52</b> each have forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> respectively. Forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> fit within the forward notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> of shaft <b>14</b>. Each of the forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> has a top flat surface <b>68</b> that is perpendicular to the depending sides <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> for engaging the bottom flat surface <b>64</b> of rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b> as shown in. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Once the forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> are engaged to the rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b>, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is prevented from sliding upward as it moves along the shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also located on each of the depending sides <b>51</b>,<b>52</b> of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> are rear rail-engaging members <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> which are sufficiently spaced proximally from the forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> so that when the forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> are placed over forward notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b>, the rear rail-engaging members <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> are directly over the rear notches <b>69</b>,<b>71</b> in the shaft <b>14</b>. The rear rail-engaging members <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> are identical to the forward rail engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> and similarly each have a top flat surface <b>68</b> for engaging the bottom flat surface <b>64</b> of rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the proximal end of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> has a male connection means <b>55</b> having grooves <b>58</b> on both sides of a key portion <b>59</b>. The male connection means <b>55</b> fits into a female connection means <b>21</b> located at the distal end <b>61</b> of the slide drive member <b>20</b>. The female connection means <b>21</b> has rails <b>23</b> for engaging the grooves <b>58</b> of the male connection means <b>55</b> and a notched area <b>78</b> for receiving the key portion <b>59</b>. The cutting/storage member <b>50</b> may be engaged to the slide drive member <b>20</b> by lowering the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> toward the slide drive member <b>20</b> so that the male and female connection means <b>55</b> and <b>21</b> slide into each other. To disengage the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> from the slide drive member <b>20</b>, the cutting storage member <b>50</b> is simply lifted out. As an alternative, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> may also be attached to the slide drive member <b>20</b> in any number of conventional ways, such as by snap fit.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is placed on the shaft <b>14</b> by aligning the forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> with the forward notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> and by simultaneously aligning the rear rail-engaging members <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> with the rear notches <b>69</b>,<b>71</b> so that the male connection means <b>55</b> slides into and engages the female connection means <b>21</b> of the slide drive member <b>20</b>. In order to properly align the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> so that it may engage the shaft <b>14</b>, the slide drive member <b>20</b> must be positioned sufficiently proximal from the foot plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The range of proximal to distal movement of the slide drive member <b>20</b> is controlled by the large diameter member <b>72</b> of the button assembly <b>70</b>. In its biased position, the large diameter member <b>72</b> is positioned in the wide portion <b>27</b> of slot <b>24</b> so that the distal edge <b>79</b> of the large diameter member <b>72</b> blocks the stop pin <b>60</b> and thus the slide drive member <b>20</b> from moving proximally along shaft <b>14</b>. The appropriate position of the slide drive member <b>20</b> for attaching the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> to the shaft <b>14</b> may only be achieved by sliding the stop pin <b>60</b> past the position of the distal edge <b>79</b> of the large diameter member <b>72</b>. In order to slide the stop pin <b>60</b> past the distal edge <b>79</b>, the button assembly <b>70</b> must be manually depressed toward the shaft <b>14</b> so that the large diameter member <b>72</b> is pushed into the recess <b>82</b> and is moved out of the wide portion <b>27</b> of slot <b>24</b>. As the forward handle <b>30</b> is biased forward by the spring means <b>40</b> and <b>40</b><i>a</i>, the slide drive member <b>20</b> is moved proximately along the shaft <b>14</b> so that the stop pin <b>60</b> is positioned within the depression <b>75</b> of the narrow diameter portion <b>74</b>. With the stop pin <b>60</b> positioned within the depression <b>75</b>, the large diameter member <b>72</b> is pushed back within the recess and the coil spring <b>84</b> is compressed within the recess <b>82</b> of the shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once aligned with the forward and rear notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> and <b>69</b>,<b>71</b> and engaged to the slide drive member <b>20</b>, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is in position to be pushed distally along shaft <b>14</b> by the slide drive member <b>20</b> toward the foot plate <b>16</b>. This is accomplished by squeezing the forward handle <b>30</b> to move the slide drive member <b>20</b> and the stop pin <b>60</b> distally so that the stop pin <b>60</b> is no longer within the depression <b>75</b> of the narrow diameter portion <b>74</b>, and the large diameter member <b>72</b> is returned to its biased position by the coil spring <b>84</b>. As the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is engaged to the slide drive member <b>20</b>, the movement of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is responsive to the movement of the slide drive member <b>20</b>. As the cutting storage member <b>50</b> is moved distally the front and rear rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> and <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> engage the rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Once the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> engages the rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b> of the shaft <b>14</b>, it may not be lifted out and the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is locked to the shaft <b>14</b>. The proximal movement of the slide drive member <b>20</b> is stopped by the large diameter member <b>72</b> in its biased position which blocks the stop pin <b>60</b> from further proximal travel in the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b>. To remove the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> from the shaft <b>14</b>, the stop pin <b>60</b> must be again positioned by the user so that it is within the depression <b>75</b> of the narrow diameter portion <b>74</b>. Thus, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> may be locked or unlocked to the shaft <b>14</b> without the use of tools by simply pressing the button assembly <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The distal end of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> opens into a storage chamber <b>88</b> which is bounded by upper and side walls <b>44</b> and <b>85</b> which are sharpened to form cutting edges <b>22</b> facing the foot plate <b>16</b>. The depending sides <b>51</b>,<b>52</b> of cutting/storage member <b>50</b> are recessed from the foot plate <b>16</b> for maximum bite since no cutting edge is required at the depending sides <b>51</b>,<b>52</b>. While the foot plate <b>16</b> may have a slight concave depression, it is to be understood that it is preferable substantially flat, with or without a cutting edge.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The storage chamber <b>88</b> extends along the interior of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b>-at least partially toward its proximal end. The cross sectional area of the interior of the storage chamber <b>88</b> may be constant or preferably progressively increases from the distal end to the proximal end so that a number of successive bone fragments can more easily slide into the storage chamber <b>88</b> and stack up without jamming.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The rongeur <b>10</b> of the present invention is used in the conventional manner to bite bone or cartilage. The cut bone fragments are pushed by the foot plate <b>16</b>, one by one, into a stack within the storage chamber <b>88</b> of the removable cutting/storage member <b>50</b> after being cut and are not likely to fall back into the wound site because they are forced into the storage chamber <b>88</b> with considerable force and are prevented from jamming as the cross sectional area of the interior space of the storage chamber <b>88</b> increases from distal to proximal away from the cutting edge <b>22</b>. Thus, it is not necessary that the cut bone fragments be removed during the surgical procedure, and bite after bite takes place, without the need to remove the rongeur <b>10</b> from the wound.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the preferred embodiment, the side walls <b>44</b> and <b>85</b> of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> have narrow slits <b>86</b>,<b>87</b> partially along the length of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b>. Once the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is filled with cut pieces of bone, it is removed from the shaft <b>14</b> and a stylet or similar instrument may be inserted through the slits <b>86</b>,<b>87</b> on either of the side walls <b>44</b>,<b>85</b> to aid in the removal of the cut pieces from the storage chamber <b>88</b> containing the cut pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Alternatively, the proximal end of the storage chamber <b>88</b> of the cutting/storage element <b>50</b> may also be open. During use, the distal end <b>61</b> of the slide drive member <b>20</b> may be used to block the open proximal end of the storage chamber <b>88</b>. Once the cutting/storage element <b>50</b> is removed from the rongeur <b>10</b>, the proximal end of the storage chamber <b>88</b> is open and a stylet may be used to push the cut bone fragments stored within the storage chamber <b>88</b> so that the fragments exit from the distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The use of a removable hollow cutting/storage member <b>50</b> permits a new sharp cutting edge to be provided for each operation as it may easily be replaced. Both the storage chamber <b>88</b> and the cutting edge <b>22</b> could be made of metal or any other suitable material such as ceramic for the edge or a plastic (e.g. polycarbonate) for the storage chamber <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the preferred embodiment, the rongeur <b>10</b> has a body <b>12</b> that is approximately 7¼ inches in length; a cutting/storage member <b>50</b> that is approximately 3¼ inches in length and approximately ⅞ inches in height and approximately ⅜ inches in width; a slide drive member <b>20</b> that is approximately 3 9/16 inches in length and approximately ⅞ inches in height and approximately ⅜ inches in width; a rear handle <b>13</b> approximately 4⅞ inches in length and a front handle <b>30</b> approximately 4⅜ inches in length having a extension member <b>33</b> that is approximately ⅞ inches long; and a button assembly <b>70</b> having an overall length of approximately 7/16 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the rongeur <b>10</b> includes a removable and disposable straw <b>90</b> as part of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Straw <b>90</b> is a hollow member in the shape of a cylinder or may have any other shape suitable for use with rongeur <b>10</b>. At the distal end of the straw <b>90</b> is a sharp cutting edge <b>92</b> for cutting bone or other similar tissue. The straw <b>90</b> has a diameter that is sufficiently sized so that it may be inserted within the storage chamber <b>88</b> of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b>. In this embodiment, the distal end of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is truncated so that the cutting edge <b>92</b> at the distal end of straw <b>90</b> extends from the chamber <b>88</b> and may be used to cut bone or cartilage against the foot plate <b>16</b>. In this embodiment, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is actually a carrier member as the straw <b>90</b> does the actual cutting and storing of the bone. Prior to use, the straw <b>90</b> is inserted within the storage chamber <b>88</b> before the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is placed on the shaft <b>14</b>. The hollow chamber <b>94</b> of the straw <b>90</b> functions to store the cut pieces of bone or cartilage. The stored cut pieces may be removed for future use in the same manner described above for the preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Straw <b>90</b> has an open distal end and a proximal end that may be closed during use of the rongeur. Additionally, straw <b>90</b> may have a cross sectional area that increases from its distal end to its proximal end.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a further alternative embodiment, the straw <b>90</b> instead of being inserted within the storage chamber <b>88</b> is affixed to the bottom of a modified cutting/storage base <b>96</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. The cutting/storage base <b>96</b> is identical in construction to the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> but does not have the storage chamber <b>88</b> and essentially acts as a housing for carrying the straw <b>90</b>. The straw <b>90</b> is placed in the bottom of the cutting/storage base <b>96</b> prior to placing the cutting/storage base <b>96</b> on the shaft <b>14</b>. The straw <b>90</b> is held in place and is prevented from rotating by pins <b>97</b>,<b>98</b> which complement the grooves <b>101</b>,<b>102</b> in the straw <b>90</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, and prevent any movement of the straw <b>90</b> within the cutting/storage base <b>96</b> during the operation of the rongeur. Once the cutting/storage base <b>96</b> is removed from the shaft <b>14</b>, the straw <b>90</b> is easily removable from the cutting/storage base <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The straw <b>90</b> is preferably made of metal or any other material which is capable of being sharpened and maintaining a sharp cutting edge <b>92</b> for multiple bites by the rongeur <b>10</b>. After the straw <b>90</b> is used and removed from the rongeur <b>10</b>, the cut pieces contained therein are removed and may be used for bone grafting purposes if desired. The relatively low cost of the straw <b>90</b> allows the straw <b>90</b> to be truly disposable.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As a further alternative embodiment of the rongeur <b>10</b>, the intersection of the foot plate <b>16</b> and the shaft <b>14</b> may have a groove <b>29</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> to relieve crossed fields of stress. In this embodiment, the distal end of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> or of a straw <b>90</b> has an extension element <b>38</b> that complements the shape of the groove <b>29</b> and fits within the groove <b>29</b>. The extension element <b>38</b> may be made of the same material as the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> or the straw <b>90</b> or may be a flexible material such as plastic. As a result of the angled orientation of the foot plate <b>16</b>, when the rongeur is fully closed, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> or the straw <b>90</b> tends to be forced up the inclination of the foot plate <b>16</b> which may result in damage to the cutting edge <b>22</b> or <b>92</b>. The combination of the groove <b>29</b> and the extension element <b>38</b> functions to prevent any further upward excursion of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> or straw <b>90</b> and thus prevents additional force from being applied to the foot plate <b>16</b> and prevents any possible damage to the cutting surfaces of the rongeur <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The operation of the rongeur <b>10</b> of the present invention is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The rongeur <b>10</b> is set in the “release position” by positioning the stop pin <b>60</b> within the depression <b>75</b> of the narrow diameter portion <b>74</b> of the button assembly <b>70</b>. This is accomplished by manually pressing the external button portion <b>76</b> of the button assembly <b>70</b> so that the large diameter member <b>72</b> moves out of the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b> to compress the coil spring <b>84</b>. The stop pin <b>60</b> may now freely pass by the position of the distal edge <b>79</b> of the large diameter member <b>72</b> and to fit within the depression <b>75</b>. As the spring means <b>40</b> and <b>40</b><i>a </i>bias the forward handle <b>30</b> distally, the slide drive member <b>20</b> moves toward the foot plate <b>16</b>. With the stop pin <b>60</b> positioned within the depression <b>75</b>, the coil spring <b>84</b> is kept compressed within the recess <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the release position, the slide drive member <b>20</b> is positioned so that the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> may be easily placed on the shaft <b>14</b>. In the release position, the forward rail-engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> are aligned with the forward notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> and the rear rail-engaging members <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> are aligned with the rear notches <b>69</b>,<b>71</b>. Once aligned, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is positioned to easily engage the slide drive member <b>20</b> so that the male and female connector means <b>55</b> and <b>21</b> mate and the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> rests upon the shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Once the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is engaged to the slide drive member <b>20</b>, the forward handle <b>30</b> is squeezed by the user to advance the slide drive member <b>20</b> so that the stop pin <b>60</b> exits from within the depression <b>75</b> and the large diameter member <b>72</b> is returned by the coil spring <b>84</b> to its biased position to block the wider portion <b>27</b> of the slot <b>24</b>. With the large diameter member <b>72</b> in this position, the stop pin <b>60</b> is stopped from any further proximal movement past the distal edge <b>79</b> of the large diameter member <b>72</b> thereby preventing any further proximal movement of the slide drive member <b>20</b> past the large diameter member <b>72</b>. With the slide drive member <b>20</b> in this position, the forward and rear rail engaging members <b>53</b>,<b>54</b> and <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> are engaged to the rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b> and are no longer aligned with the forward and rear notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> and <b>69</b>,<b>71</b>. Therefore, the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is securely locked to the shaft <b>14</b> and may not be removed from the shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With the cutting/storage member <b>20</b> in the locked position on the shaft <b>14</b>, the rongeur <b>10</b> may be placed in the wound and used to take multiple bites or cuts of the selected tissue with the cut pieces being stored within the storage chamber <b>88</b> of the cutting/storage element <b>50</b>. Once the desired number of bites has been attained or if the storage chamber <b>88</b> becomes filled, the rongeur <b>10</b> is removed from the wound. The cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is removed from the shaft <b>14</b> of the rongeur by returning the rongeur to the release position by pressing the external button portion <b>76</b> as described above, so that the forward and rear rail-engaging members <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> and <b>56</b>,<b>57</b> are once again aligned with the forward and rear notches <b>65</b>,<b>66</b> and <b>69</b>,<b>71</b> and no longer engage the rails <b>62</b>,<b>63</b>. The cutting/storage member <b>50</b> is then easily lifted up and away from the shaft <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The cut pieces may be removed from the storage chamber <b>88</b> by inserting a stylet in the slits <b>86</b>,<b>87</b> in the side walls <b>44</b>,<b>45</b> of the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> and pushing the cut pieces out from the chamber. If an alternative embodiment of the cutting/storage element <b>50</b> is used where the proximal end of the storage chamber <b>88</b> is closed only during use, the cut pieces may be pushed out of either end of the storage chamber <b>88</b>. Similarly, if a disposable straw <b>90</b> is used, the cut pieces contained within the straw <b>90</b> may be removed by using a stylet to the push the cut pieces out of either the proximal or the distal end of the straw <b>90</b> which are both open when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">While the preferred embodiment of the present invention is a hand powered instrument, the use of alternative power sources such as electricity, battery supply, pneumatic, or other power sources can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a powered rongeur, the finger grip of the rongeur can then be devoted to turning on and off the power supply source to drive the instrument. If gas or other fluid is used, a pressure relief valve is preferably incorporated within the fluid line to establish a limit pressure, which may be set to the maximum desired biting force to be delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a powered rongeur <b>200</b> is shown. The grip <b>202</b> is adapted for receipt of the electronic circuitry <b>204</b> and the rechargeable battery pack <b>206</b>. A cover (not shown) holds the battery pack <b>206</b> within the grip <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Above the grip <b>202</b>, is a housing <b>208</b> containing a wire coil <b>210</b> that surrounds a reciprocating rod <b>212</b>. The rod <b>212</b> is connected at one end <b>214</b> to the slide drive member <b>20</b>. The rod <b>212</b> is spring biased by a strong spring <b>216</b> in the proximal direction. Whereby, upon activation of the trigger <b>218</b> which closes switch <b>220</b>, the rod <b>212</b> is driven forward driving the slide drive member <b>20</b> and the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> toward the foot plate <b>16</b>. The speed of the rod <b>212</b> would result in additional cutting force, due to the momentum of the slide drive member <b>20</b>. As a safety precaution, the momentum at which the rod <b>212</b> is driven forward may be set to a desired rate so that excessive force is not exerted on the cutting edge <b>22</b> and the foot plate <b>16</b>. For example, the momentum generated by the coil <b>210</b> and the rod <b>212</b> may be set at a desired rate for cutting bone or cartilage so that the rongeur <b>200</b> will not bite a hard object, such as a metal pin, which requires a greater momentum to cut and would damage the foot plate <b>16</b> and the cutting edge <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Pulling of the trigger <b>218</b> closes the switch <b>220</b> to cause one closing and opening of the rongeur <b>200</b>. For a second closing operation, the trigger <b>218</b> must be released and then depressed again in order to close switch <b>220</b> once again.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The rear portion of the housing <b>208</b> can be opened for access to the compartment by the removal of cap <b>222</b>. Prior to sterilization, the cap <b>222</b> and the coil <b>210</b> can be removed from the housing <b>208</b>. The rongeur <b>200</b> can be sterilized by heat upon removal of the coil <b>210</b> and the battery pack <b>206</b>. Alternatively, the device can be cold gas sterilized or irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The rod <b>212</b> can be adjustable along the longitudinal axis, either by threads or other means, so that it can be moved forward if necessary. Also, a safety mechanism for preventing activation of the switch <b>220</b>, well known in electrically operated devices, can be included. This could consist of a mechanical interference between the trigger and the switch to prevent activation of the switch <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In use, the surgeon would insert the rongeur <b>200</b> around the lamina to be cut and the trigger <b>218</b> would be pulled. The pulling of the trigger would cause the slide drive member <b>20</b> and the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> to be driven forward to close against the foot plate <b>16</b> cutting the bone, and then automatically returned to the original open position. Releasing the trigger <b>214</b> would permit the cutting/storage element <b>50</b> to return to its open position. The surgeon would then move the rongeur <b>200</b>, without removing the rongeur <b>200</b> from the wound, to a new area for biting the bone, again activating the trigger and causing the rongeur to close. The device could be programmed to close at a predetermined rate, so that it would automatically open and close. After completion of the cutting procedure the rongeur <b>200</b> would be removed and the cutting/storage member <b>50</b> removed and replaced in the same manner described above for the manual rongeur <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">While the present invention has been described in association with the preferred embodiment, it is recognized that other variations of the present invention may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
