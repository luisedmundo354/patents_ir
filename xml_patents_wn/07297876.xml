<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apply heat to thermoplastic resin film, which is eventually to become an insulating resin layer, and press the film against a mold for forming grooves on a surface of the film. Next, press-fit an electronic component into the resin film from a back-face of the film, thereby exposing electrodes of the component from a bottom of the grooves. Then cool the film for curing. Peel the film off the mold, then fill the grooves with conductive paste, and cure the paste for forming circuit patterns. The foregoing procedure allows bringing the electrodes positively into conduction with the circuit patterns of a circuit board incorporating the electronic component, and achieving a narrower pitch between routings of the circuit patterns.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a circuit board incorporating electronic components and a method of manufacturing the same circuit board.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, narrower pitches of circuit patterns of circuit boards have been required in the market in order to increase a board density. In parallel with this tendency, a circuit board incorporating electronic components therein is proposed. The circuit board incorporating electronic components, in particular, is required to have a further narrower pitch in circuit patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Utility Model Publication No. S62-70473 discloses a method of avoiding short circuits in a circuit having a narrow pitch: forming grooves on an insulated board, and then filling the grooves with conductive paste for forming a circuit, thereby avoiding short-circuits. However, this utility model does not teach at all about incorporating electronic components in the board per se.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, Japanese Patent Application Non-Examined Publication No. 2001-93934 discloses a method of manufacturing a circuit board incorporating electronic components as follows: First, press-fit an electronic component into insulating resin, and expose electrodes of the component from a flat surface of the opposite side of the resin. Next, print a circuit pattern on the flat surface, thereby coupling the component with the pattern. However, since circuit patterns with narrow pitches are formed on the flat face of the circuit board manufactured by this method, a short circuit tends to occur between the circuit patterns.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention addresses the problem discussed above, and aims to provide a circuit board with a circuit pattern having a narrower pitch free from short circuits and a method of manufacturing the same circuit board, which has a higher density and more sophistication besides the foregoing advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The circuit board of the present invention comprises the following elements:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">an insulating resin layer of which surface has grooves corresponding to circuit patterns;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">electronic components disposed interior the insulating resin layer, and having electrodes exposed from the bottom of the grooves; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">a circuit pattern formed in the grooves.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">The method of manufacturing the same circuit board comprising:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0011">forming grooves corresponding to a circuit pattern on a surface of the insulating resin layer;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0012">press-fitting an electronic component into the insulating resin layer from the back face opposite to the surface, on which the grooves are formed, such that electrode terminals of the component expose themselves from the bottom of the grooves; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0013">forming an electrode-layer in the grooves.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">The foregoing structure allows forming the circuit patterns in the grooves formed on the surface of the insulating resin layer, so that routings of the pattern are positively isolated by the insulating resin layer. As a result, short circuits between the routings of the circuit pattern can be prevented. The electrodes of the electronic component press-fitted from the back face of the insulating resin layer become positively conductive with the circuit pattern at the bottom of the grooves. This preparation allows a narrower pitch between the routings of the circuit pattern of the circuit board incorporating the electronic components.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0044">Insulating resin layer <b>2</b> formed of thermoplastic resin is taken as an example of manufacturing circuit board <b>1</b>, and this manufacturing method is demonstrated hereinafter with reference to the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3-FIG</figref>. <b>9</b> illustrating steps of the manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a preparation step for forming grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>on thermoplastic resin film <b>20</b> which is to be insulating resin layer <b>2</b>. Prepare press-head <b>11</b> and mold <b>10</b> having protrusions <b>10</b><i>a </i>reversal to grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>formed on insulating resin layer <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First, heat mold <b>10</b> and press-head <b>11</b> (step S<b>11</b>) at a temperature not lower than the softening point of resin film <b>20</b> (e.g. 200° C.). Next, place thermoplastic resin film <b>20</b> and mold releasing paper <b>12</b> in this order from mold <b>10</b> toward press head <b>11</b> (step S<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">Thermoplastic resin film <b>20</b> is, e.g. a sheet of film made of polyethylene terephthalate glycol modified (PETG) of which softening point is 200° C. The sheet has dimensions of 200 mm (long), 200 mm (wide) and 200 μm (thick). Other thermoplastic resin to be used as resin film <b>20</b> are, e.g. polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Mold releasing paper <b>12</b> can be made of Teflon® of 100 μm thickness, or, e.g. polytetrafluoro-ethylene, tetra-fluoroethyulene perfluoro alkylvinyl ether mixed polymer, or polyimide.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, press resin film <b>20</b> against mold <b>10</b> having protrusions <b>10</b><i>a </i>via mold releasing paper <b>12</b> by press head <b>11</b> at a given pressure and for a given time (step S<b>13</b>). Each one of protrusions <b>10</b><i>a </i>is shaped like, e.g. 200 μm wide and 20 μm high. This pressing condition is preferably 0.5-1.5 kgf/mm<sup>2 </sup>and 120-140 seconds. The pressure must be carefully applied not to leave bubbles. To be more specific, load and temperature are gradually increased for the first 60 seconds, then the load and temperature are maintained for the next 60 seconds. This procedure allows forming grooves <b>2</b><i>b, </i>of which shape is reversal to protrusions <b>10</b><i>a </i>of mold <b>10</b>, on surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of resin film <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">Then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, mount resin film <b>20</b> on mold <b>10</b>, and remove press head <b>11</b> and mold releasing paper <b>12</b> with the temperature maintained over the softening point. Resin film <b>20</b> can be cooled forcibly or naturally in removing mold releasing paper <b>12</b> to reduce its temperature lower than the softening point temporarily. This preparation allows resin film <b>20</b> to keep its shape steadily. It is preferable to spray release agent in advance on the surface of mold <b>10</b> including protrusions <b>10</b><i>a </i>because this preparation results in easier release of resin film <b>20</b> from mold <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">Following the foregoing procedure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, place electronic component <b>4</b> sucked and held by chuck <b>13</b><i>a </i>toward back face <b>2</b><i>c </i>of resin film <b>20</b> (back face <b>2</b><i>c </i>is an opposite face to the grooved face), then position component <b>4</b> such that electrode terminals <b>3</b> of component <b>4</b> face grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>on resin film <b>20</b> (step S<b>14</b>). In this embodiment, electronic component <b>4</b> is, e.g. an IC chip. This IC chip has a bare-chip structure, and dimensions of 6 mm square, 160 μm thickness. Electrode terminals <b>3</b> made of gold (Au) are formed on the circuited face in a quantity of 50. Electrode terminals <b>3</b> are stud-bumps, each one of which has two steps having different diameters, namely, the surface of the IC chip is 80 μm across and 20 μm high, and the second step formed thereon is 40 μm across and 60 μm high. In other words, the total height of electrode terminal <b>3</b> is 80 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">After the positioning in step S<b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with alternate long and two short dashes lines, move chuck <b>13</b><i>a </i>downward, so that component <b>4</b> is press-fitted into resin film <b>20</b>. If component <b>4</b> can be press-fitted without positional deviation in the next press step, component <b>4</b> can be only partially press-fitted in this step, or it can be press-fitted until it touches mold <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">After the press-fit of component <b>4</b> into resin film <b>20</b>, further press-fit component <b>4</b> into resin film <b>20</b> by press head <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> via mold releasing paper <b>12</b><i>a. </i>For instance, apply load of 40-50 kgf and press component <b>4</b> until its electrode terminals <b>3</b> expose themselves from the bottom of grooves <b>2</b><i>b. </i>To be more specific, press-fit component <b>4</b> further into resin film <b>20</b> with resin film <b>20</b> pressed against mold <b>10</b> until electrode terminals <b>3</b> are brought into substantially contact with projections <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the stud-bumps of terminals <b>3</b> are partially deformed (step S<b>15</b>). At this time, heat resin-film <b>20</b>, e.g. up to 150-170° C. for 20-150 seconds. To be more specific, heat resin-film <b>20</b> up to 150-170° C. for the first 5 seconds, and keep the temperature until a given time lapses. Then cool resin film <b>20</b> with component <b>4</b> pressed against film <b>20</b> by press head <b>13</b> before resin film <b>20</b> is deformed, and then cure resin film <b>20</b> (step S<b>16</b>). Cool resin film <b>20</b> down to, e.g. 110° C. and cure it, then peel film <b>20</b> off mold <b>10</b> (step S<b>17</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">Then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, turn resin film <b>20</b> upside down, and place it with grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>facing upward. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, fill grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>on surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of resin film <b>20</b> with thermosetting conductive paste <b>15</b> using a screen printing method (step S<b>18</b>). Apply heat to conductive paste <b>15</b> up to a temperature lower than the softening point of resin film <b>20</b>, e.g. 110° C., for curing paste <b>15</b>. This process forms circuit pattern <b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (step S<b>19</b>). A mask used at the screen printing has dimensions of 160 μm aperture width and 20-30 μm film thickness after the print. A squeegee having 70° hardness is used at the printing. It is held at an angle of 60-80° and moved at a speed of 15-100 mm/s under a pressure of 0.4-1.5 kgf/mm<sup>2 </sup>for printing the conductive paste.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">It is preferable to cure paste <b>15</b> by applying a pressure to paste <b>15</b> with a jig. For instance, a metal jig, of which flat face is kept at a temperature of 110° C., is used for applying a pressure of 0.5-1.5 kgf/mm<sup>2 </sup>for about 10 minutes. When photo-setting conductive paste <b>15</b> is used, irradiate paste <b>15</b> with the light such as ultraviolet ray for curing, then circuit board <b>1</b> is obtained. When grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>are filled with paste <b>15</b>, an ink-jet method or a dispense method can be used instead of the screen printing method.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">Tips of electrode terminals <b>3</b> of component <b>4</b> expose themselves from the bottom of grooves <b>2</b><i>b, </i>so that cure of paste <b>15</b> makes terminals <b>3</b> and circuit pattern <b>5</b> conductive with each other. As a result, resin film <b>20</b> becomes insulating resin layer <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Layer <b>2</b> incorporates component <b>4</b>, and the circuit patterns are formed in grooves <b>2</b><i>b, </i>so that circuit board <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is obtainable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">Material of mold <b>10</b> is not limited to a specific one; however, it is preferable to use metal having a large heat conductivity and rigidity, such as stainless-steel (SUS), because heating and pressing by press heads <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> are needed for softening layer <b>2</b>. Since quartz glass has a high rigidity, it can be used as mold <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">In this embodiment, the following material is used as conductive paste <b>15</b>: flaked Ag, or metal filler shaped like fine beads are filled in thermosetting resin having shrink characteristics (e.g. epoxy resin of which curing temperature is 110° C. and curing time is 10 minutes). Heating and curing of the conductive paste shrink the thermosetting resin, and bring metal fillers into contact with each other, so that excellent conductivity is obtainable. The metal filler included in paste <b>15</b> can be Cu, Ni, Pd, or Au. The conductive paste can be photo-setting paste. Grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>can be partially filled with paste of resistant material or dielectric material. Further, the conductive paste can be thermoplastic paste or low-temperature baked paste.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">As discussed above, in the manufacturing steps of circuit board <b>1</b>, use of mold <b>10</b> facilitates forming grooves <b>2</b><i>b. </i>When component <b>4</b> is press-fitted into thermoplastic resin film <b>20</b>, projections <b>10</b><i>a </i>of mold <b>10</b> are placed toward electrode terminals <b>3</b>, so that tips of terminals <b>3</b> can be exposed from the bottom of grooves <b>2</b><i>b. </i>This structure allows electrode terminals <b>3</b> to become positively conductive with circuit patterns <b>5</b>. Circuit patterns <b>5</b> are formed inside grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>formed on surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of insulating resin layer <b>2</b>, so that the routings of patterns <b>5</b> are positively isolated by layer <b>2</b>. Thus a short circuit between circuit patterns <b>5</b> can be prevented. As a result, a narrower pitch between the routings of circuit patterns <b>5</b> is achievable.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">After the press-fit of component <b>4</b>, circuit patterns <b>5</b> can be formed before layer <b>2</b> is completely cured, so that the manufacturing time of circuit board <b>1</b> can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">The flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a case where insulating resin layer <b>2</b> is formed of thermoplastic resin; however, thermosetting resin or photo-setting resin can be used instead of thermoplastic resin. In such a case, mold <b>10</b> and press head <b>13</b> are not heated in step S<b>11</b>. In other words, resin film <b>20</b> is pressed against mold <b>10</b>, and component <b>4</b> is press-fitted into film <b>20</b> (step S<b>12</b>-S<b>15</b>), then resin film <b>20</b> is cured by heating or photo irradiation instead of cooling (step S<b>16</b>). Then resin film is peeled off mold <b>10</b>, and grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>are filled with conductive paste <b>15</b>, which is then cured (step S<b>17</b>-S<b>19</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">When photo-setting resin film <b>20</b> is used, mold <b>10</b> is formed of photo-conductive material for curing, or resin film <b>20</b> is irradiated with the light just before the press-fit of component <b>4</b> in order to start curing, and resin film <b>20</b> is completely cured after the press-fit.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, resin film <b>20</b> is firstly pressed against mold <b>10</b> (step S<b>13</b>), then component <b>4</b> is press-fitted (step S<b>15</b>); however, this order can be reversed. Circuit board <b>1</b> can be manufactured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which shows a manufacturing method modified from that in accordance with this embodiment. First, temporarily press-fit electronic component <b>4</b> onto resin film <b>20</b>, then place mold releasing paper <b>12</b><i>a </i>and press head <b>13</b> above resin film <b>20</b> made of whichever resin of thermoplastic, thermosetting, or photo-setting. Mold <b>10</b> is placed under film <b>20</b>. Then press softened film <b>20</b> against mold <b>10</b> (step S<b>13</b>), at this time, component <b>4</b> can be press-fitted into film <b>20</b> simultaneously (step S<b>15</b>). This method can further shorten the manufacturing time of circuit board <b>1</b>. In this modified method, when steps S<b>13</b> and S<b>15</b> are simultaneously carried out, component <b>4</b> and mold <b>10</b> can be mechanically positioned and retained, so that positional alignment between electrode terminals <b>3</b> and projections <b>10</b><i>a </i>of mold <b>10</b> can be done with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">On the other hand, liquid thermosetting resin or liquid photo-setting resin can be used instead of thermosetting or photo-setting resin film <b>20</b>. In this case, instead of step S<b>11</b>-S<b>13</b>, apply the resin to mold <b>10</b>, and press-fit component <b>4</b> into the resin via the mold releasing paper (steps S<b>14</b>, S<b>15</b>). Then cure the thermosetting or photo-setting resin (step S<b>16</b>), and carry out the procedures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for forming circuit patterns <b>5</b> in grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>(steps S<b>17</b>-S<b>19</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, press thermoplastic resin film <b>20</b>, which is to be insulating resin layer <b>2</b>, against mold <b>10</b> for forming grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>(step S<b>13</b>). Next, remove press head <b>11</b> and a sheet of mold releasing paper, then stop heating mold <b>10</b> for curing film <b>20</b> forcibly or naturally (step S<b>21</b>). Then peel film <b>20</b> off mold <b>10</b>, and turn film <b>20</b> upside down (step S<b>22</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0066">Then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, face circuited surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>downward, and place resin film <b>20</b> on base plate <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0067">After the press-fit of component <b>4</b> into film <b>20</b>, place mold-releasing paper <b>12</b><i>a </i>and press head <b>13</b> on component <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Then press-fit component <b>4</b> further into film <b>20</b> from back face <b>2</b><i>c </i>by press head <b>13</b> until electrode terminals <b>3</b> of component <b>4</b> extend through film <b>20</b> to reach circuit patterns <b>5</b> (step S<b>27</b>). Next, cool film <b>20</b> with component <b>4</b> pressed against film <b>20</b> by press head <b>13</b> for re-curing film <b>20</b>. This procedure allows film <b>20</b> to become insulating resin layer <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and circuit board <b>1</b> is thus produced (step S<b>28</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">In the manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the step of forming circuit patterns <b>5</b> by filling and curing paste <b>15</b> is carried out before the step of press-fitting component <b>4</b> into film <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0070">The manufacturing method in accordance with the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention is demonstrated hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15-FIG</figref>. <b>19</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0071">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, place resin film <b>20</b>, which is to be insulating resin layer <b>2</b>, on base plate <b>16</b>.

This procedure allows press-fitting component <b>4</b> further into film <b>20</b> from back face <b>2</b><i>c </i>opposite to base plate <b>16</b> (step S<b>33</b>). If resin film <b>20</b> is made from thermoplastic resin, heat component <b>4</b> via press head <b>13</b> when the press-fit is done, and then cure film <b>20</b> (step S<b>34</b>).

This procedure allows resin film <b>20</b> to become insulating resin layer <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and circuit board <b>1</b> incorporating electronic component <b>4</b> is thus produced (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">In the manufacturing steps of circuit board <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, firstly press-fit electronic component <b>4</b> into resin film <b>20</b>, then form grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>on film <b>20</b> by, e.g. plasma etching, as deep as electrode terminals <b>3</b> of component <b>4</b> are exposed. This structure allows terminals <b>3</b> to be positively conductive with circuit pattern <b>5</b>. Thermosetting resin or photo-setting resin can be used as resin film <b>20</b> instead of thermoplastic resin. If electrode terminal <b>3</b> is flat, such as a plated bump, the foregoing manufacturing method allows terminal <b>3</b> to expose itself with ease from the bottom of groove <b>2</b><i>b. </i>Narrower pitches can be obtainable in the routings of circuit patterns <b>5</b>. This is as a matter of course and similar to the method described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0076">When film <b>20</b> made from thermosetting resin is used, step S<b>34</b> for curing film <b>20</b> can be omitted, and curing both of conductive paste <b>15</b> and resin film <b>20</b> can be simultaneously done in step S<b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0077">Instead of film <b>20</b> made from thermosetting resin or photo-setting resin, liquid thermosetting or liquid photo setting resin can be used.

<p id="p-0070" num="0078">The fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention relates to a circuit board of which insulating resin layer is made from thermosetting resin or photo-setting resin, and it also relates to a method of manufacturing the same circuit board. The manufacturing method is demonstrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>. Steps common to those of the first and second embodiments are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> already described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a flowchart illustrating steps of the manufacturing method in accordance with the fourth embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a sectional view illustrating a step of the manufacturing method.

<p id="p-0071" num="0079">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, place resin film <b>20</b> made from thermosetting or photo-setting resin between mold <b>10</b> and press head <b>11</b> via mold releasing paper <b>12</b> which is disposed between press head <b>11</b> and resin film <b>20</b> (step S<b>41</b>). This resin film <b>20</b> is eventually to become insulating resin layer <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, press film <b>20</b> against mold <b>10</b> by press head <b>11</b> with a given pressure and for a given time (step S<b>42</b>). This structure allows forming grooves <b>2</b><i>b, </i>of which shape is reversal to that of projections <b>10</b><i>a, </i>on film <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0080">Second, remove press head <b>11</b> and mold releasing paper <b>12</b><i>a, </i>and peel film <b>20</b> off mold <b>10</b> (step S<b>43</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, turn film <b>20</b> upside down, and fill grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>formed on surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of film <b>20</b> with conductive paste <b>15</b> (step S<b>44</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, place film <b>20</b> on base plate <b>14</b> with its grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>facing downward again, then place component <b>4</b> sucked by chuck <b>13</b><i>a </i>such that component <b>4</b> faces back-face <b>2</b><i>c </i>of film <b>20</b> (step S<b>45</b>).

<p id="p-0074" num="0082">After the press-fit of component <b>4</b>, place press head <b>13</b> on component <b>4</b> via mold releasing paper <b>12</b><i>a, </i>and move press head <b>13</b> downward (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).

At this time, when film <b>20</b> made from thermosetting resin is used, heat press-head <b>13</b> and base-plate <b>14</b>, thereby curing film <b>20</b> and thermosetting conductive paste <b>15</b> simultaneously. This procedure allows conductive paste <b>15</b> to form circuit patterns <b>5</b> (step S<b>47</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. When film <b>20</b> made from photo-setting resin is used, irradiate film <b>20</b> with ultraviolet ray just before component <b>4</b> is press-fitted, which cures film <b>20</b> after component <b>4</b> is press-fitted. In this case, if thermosetting conductive paste <b>15</b> is used, heat of base plate <b>14</b> will cure conductive paste <b>15</b>. Conductive paste <b>15</b> having photo-setting property can be also used. In this case, photo-setting resin film <b>20</b> and paste <b>15</b> can be cured simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0083">The foregoing manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> can achieve a narrower pitch between the routings of the circuit patterns, and yet, obtain circuit board <b>1</b> incorporating electronic component <b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0084">The fifth exemplary embodiment of the present invention relates to a circuit board of which insulating resin layer is made from thermosetting resin or photo-setting resin, and it also relates to a method of manufacturing the same circuit board. The manufacturing method is demonstrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Steps common to those of the first embodiment will be demonstrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>9</b> already described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a flowchart illustrating steps of the manufacturing method in accordance with the fifth embodiment. Similar elements to those in the first through fourth embodiments have the same reference marks.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0085">First, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> shows, place resin film <b>20</b> made from thermosetting or photo-setting resin on mold <b>10</b>, and press film <b>20</b> against mold <b>10</b> by press head <b>11</b>. This procedure allows forming grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>of which shape is reversal to that of projection <b>10</b><i>a </i>of mold <b>10</b> (steps S<b>51</b>, S<b>52</b>). This resin film <b>20</b> is eventually to become insulating rein layer <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0086">Second, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, place electronic component <b>4</b> sucked by chuck <b>13</b><i>a </i>such that component <b>4</b> faces back-face <b>2</b><i>c </i>of insulating resin layer <b>2</b> (step S<b>53</b>). Then move chuck <b>13</b><i>a </i>downward to press-fit component <b>4</b> into film <b>20</b>. After the press-fit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, move press-head <b>13</b> downward via mold releasing paper <b>12</b><i>a, </i>thereby press-fitting component <b>4</b> further into film <b>20</b> from back-face <b>2</b><i>c </i>until electrode terminals <b>3</b> of component <b>4</b> expose themselves from the bottom of grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>(step S<b>54</b>). Then peel film <b>20</b> off mold <b>10</b>, and cure film <b>20</b> (step S<b>55</b>, S<b>56</b>). To be more specific, when film <b>20</b> made from thermosetting resin is used, heat film <b>20</b>. When film <b>20</b> made from photo-setting resin is used, irradiate film <b>20</b> with the light.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0087">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, turn film <b>20</b> upside down, and fill grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>with conductive paste <b>15</b> (step S<b>57</b>). Then cure paste <b>15</b> by heating or photo irradiation to form circuit patterns <b>5</b> (step S<b>58</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0088">The foregoing manufacturing method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> cures film <b>20</b> first, and then cures conductive paste <b>15</b>. This procedure allows obtaining a stable shape of grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>even if film <b>20</b> is peeled off mold <b>10</b> before film <b>20</b> is cured.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0089">As discussed above, several methods of manufacturing circuit board <b>1</b>, which has circuit patterns <b>5</b> formed in grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>and incorporates electronic component <b>4</b>, are described. A method out of the foregoing methods is selected appropriately to a thickness of circuit board <b>1</b>, easiness of handling board <b>1</b>, and environment of board <b>1</b>. Whichever method is selected, since circuit patterns <b>5</b> are formed in grooves <b>2</b><i>b, </i>a narrower pitch between the routings of circuit patterns <b>5</b> is achievable. Some steps can be carried out simultaneously as discussed above, so that the manufacturing time can be shortened. The present invention is not limited only to the exemplary embodiments previously discussed; however, various modifications are available within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0090">A sectional shape of groove <b>2</b><i>b </i>is rectangular in the foregoing descriptions; however, the shape can be another shape, e.g. semicircle. In the foregoing descriptions, resin film <b>20</b> is used for forming insulating resin layer <b>2</b>; however, a resin board can be used depending on a shape of electronic component <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0091">In the foregoing descriptions, insulating resin layer <b>2</b> of circuit board <b>1</b> has a single layer; however, circuit board <b>1</b> as a part of multi-layered board can be manufactured. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, another circuit pattern coupled to circuit pattern <b>5</b> can be formed on surface <b>2</b><i>a, </i>or another electronic component can be mounted on surface <b>2</b><i>a. </i>Further, a reinforcing resin board can be bonded to a top surface or underside of circuit board <b>1</b>. In this case, the reinforcing resin board can be bonded to the insulating resin layer just after circuit patterns <b>5</b> are formed, or just after component <b>4</b> is press-fitted.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0092">The foregoing embodiments describe a method of forming circuit patterns in grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>by using conductive paste <b>15</b>; however, the circuit patterns can be formed by another method. For instance, a film is formed in grooves <b>2</b><i>b </i>by plating or sputtering for forming a circuit pattern. This method allows increasing adhesion strength between the circuit patterns and insulating resin layer <b>2</b>, so that micro-routings are achievable with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0093">The present invention, as discussed above, brings electrodes of an electronic component press-fitted into an insulating resin layer positively into conduction with routings of circuit patterns formed in recesses on the surface of the insulating resin layer. As a result, a narrower pitch between the routings of the circuit patterns is achievable. Therefore, the circuit board and the manufacturing method of the same board of the present invention can be widely applicable to circuit boards incorporating electronic components and manufacturing methods of those boards.</p>
