<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is generally directed to recloseable rings and, more specifically, to an improved recloseable ring and a method of manufacture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recloseable rings generally include two shank portions that are detachably connected to allow placement of the recloseable ring on a finger without necessitating that the ring slide over the length of a finger for proper positioning. A ring wearer can sometimes encounter difficulty properly positioning a ring on his or her finger due to relatively large knuckle size and increases in finger size due to stress, medications, pregnancy, or the like. Recloseable rings are designed to provide a custom fit that obviates the above problems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional recloseable rings require significant highly skilled manual labor due to numerous handcrafting steps that need to be performed by accomplished jewelers. Typically, such rings are manufactured using molds that are used to injection mold ring component pieces that are then used for casting portions of conventional recloseable rings. Once the portions of the recloseable ring are cast, numerous precision manual adjustments and processes must be performed by highly skilled jewelers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>, the molds used for conventional recloseable rings are designed to create a mound of metal <b>20</b> which surrounds a latch pin hole <b>22</b> on an end of one of the ring shank portions <b>24</b> that supports a latch <b>28</b>. Once the pin <b>26</b> is inserted into the hole and through the latch during the assembly process, the ring shank portion <b>24</b> and latch <b>28</b> are taken to a riveting machine (not shown), carefully lined up and clamped into position. The proper positioning and clamping of a delicate high-end jewelry piece is painstaking, time consuming work for a jeweler.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The jeweler then has to carefully lower the rivet machine bit over the mound of metal <b>20</b> that surrounds the pin <b>26</b> and push the metal <b>20</b> over the top of the pin. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, when the hole <b>22</b> was covered, the shank portion <b>24</b> and latch <b>28</b> were removed from the clamp. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, any excess metal was then polished smooth to form a pleasing aesthetic look. However, this manufacturing process is problematic in that the jeweler can never be sure precisely how much metal <b>30</b> remains to cover the latch pin after polishing. This results in ring wearers experiencing breakdowns and requiring repairs that are expensive for the wearer and damaging to the reputation of the ring manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9C-9F</figref>, the conventional recloseable ring also requires two additional riveting operations to hingeably connect the two ring shank portions. The hinge pin <b>32</b> is secured within the hinge pin hole <b>34</b> without any mounds of metal <b>20</b> being pre-formed on the hinge ends of the shank portions. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, the hinge pin <b>32</b> is inserted into the hinge pin hole <b>34</b> and extends outwardly on both sides of the connected ring shank portions. The extra length of the pin <b>32</b> is then used to fill the gaps between the outer shank portion walls and the pin to secure the hinge pin <b>32</b> into position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, the two shank portions <b>24</b> and the hinge pin <b>32</b> are taken to the riveting machine, lined up, and clamped into position. Then, the riveting machine compresses a first end of the hinge pin <b>32</b> to fill the corresponding gap. Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>, the two ring shank portions <b>24</b> and the hinge pin <b>32</b> are removed from the riveting machine, reversed in position, painstakingly repositioned in the machine, lined up, and clamped in place. Then, the press is lowered onto the remaining protruding portion of the hinge pin <b>32</b> to force the excess metal to spread out and fill the remaining gap. Then it is necessary to manually polish both sides of the ring to eliminate any blemishes created by the filling of the gaps between the hinge pin and the outer shank portion walls.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the riveting process for conventional recloseable rings must be performed three times. It is inefficient, time consuming, and creates troublesome inconsistencies in the finished product. The hinge holes and latch holes are often not completely filled, not secured, and can be unsightly as a jewelry product.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another problem with conventional recloseable rings is that the latches used to secure the ring are generally thin and weak. A thin latch is inadequate for normal daily wear and is one of the most common reasons for the return of a recloseable ring. During the normal process of filing and polishing the shank portions <b>24</b>, a bench jeweler often removes too much metal from the latch, thinning it further and causing it to bend easily. This results in the latch being defective. One solution has been to make the overall ring generally thicker to allow the latch to also be thicker. While this somewhat addresses the problem of a defective latch, it results in a bulkier and less attractive recloseable ring.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conventional recloseable rings also require a significant depression of a free end of the latch to release the latch to remove the ring. This significant depression distance detracts from the convenience and operability of the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, conventional recloseable rings include a shank portion <b>24</b> defining a cavity <b>38</b> to receive a head <b>40</b> of the latch <b>28</b>. The cavity <b>38</b> is generally formed by opposing side walls <b>42</b> and a base <b>44</b>. The opposing side walls intersect the base <b>44</b> at a ninety (90°) degree angle which requires that the connection area <b>43</b> between the base <b>44</b> and the opposing side walls <b>42</b> be sufficiently large to avoid separation during injection molding of the piece used to form the shank portion. This minimizes the size of the latch head <b>40</b> which limits the thickness of the latch and therefore weakens the latch connection of conventional recloseable rings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, conventional recloseable rings also require the filing of shank portion edges <b>46</b> proximate to the hinge ends thereof to reduce the incidence of scratching or catching of any loose finger skin when the ring is put on. The filing and polishing of the edges <b>46</b> is a time consuming and delicate process that must be performed by a jeweler that results in inconsistencies between rings.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The molds for forming the ring component pieces for conventional recloseable rings are manufactured on an individual basis. During the manufacture of the molds, each mold is modified based on intuition from a prior mold(s) which results in no consistency between the molds. Each mold is only capable of producing a single shank portion which makes production even more costly. As this is the only known way of using injection molding to manufacturer recloseable rings, any shrinkage of the material used to form the ring component pieces during the manufacturing process results in each component of the finished ring needing significant adjustment to properly assemble a suitable recloseable ring. Accordingly, each ring requires varying amounts of corrective labor depending upon the molds that were used to make the desired ring. Correcting the actual size of the ring components requires that the ring shank portions are manually inserted into a rolling mill and stretched to size. This causes the rings to twist and torque which reduces the effective alignment between the ring shank portions when assembled. In some cases, it is necessary to manually place the conventional ring shank portions in a bench vice so that a jeweler can carefully judge how much pressure is necessary to straighten each piece. The correction of the sizing of ring shank portions manufactured using the individual molds is delicate, time consuming work that requires a highly skilled jeweler.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Conventional recloseable rings use a “one size fits all” latch to accommodate various ring sizes. To create a proper fit for the latch, it is necessary to bend and fit the latch for each ring. This is a delicate, time consuming process for a jeweler that results in a high number of rejects. When the latch must be shortened, and too much excess latch material is removed, a ring will not function properly and must be scrapped.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As should be apparent from the above, conventional recloseable rings require significant, expensive, highly skilled manual labor by expert jewelers to produce a superior product. It would be advantageous to provide an improved recloseable ring and method of manufacture thereof that reduces the amount of skill and manual labor necessary to manufacture a satisfactory product; that provides a thicker latch without a corresponding increase in thickness of the overall ring; that eliminates many of the polishing steps; that eliminates the multiple excruciating uses of the rivet machine; that reduces the occurrence of pinched skin when placing the recloseable ring over a finger; that provides for uniform molds across all ring sizes; that allows the ring component pieces used to form both halves of the ring to be formed by a single injection molding operation; and/or that eliminates the “one size fits all” latch used in conventional recloseable rings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Briefly speaking, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of forming a recloseable ring. The method includes: providing first and second shank portions, each having a hinge end; aligning the hinge end of the first and second shank portions so that the first and second shank portions combine to form a bore adapted to receive a hinge pin, one of the first and second shank portions defining an opening to the bore; inserting the hinge pin into the bore; and laser welding the hinge pin to a portion of the bore such that the first and second shank portions are pivotably connected by the hinge pin.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A separate embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of making a recloseable ring having a thicker latch than conventional recloseable rings without having to increase an overall thickness of the recloseable ring. The method includes: providing a shank portion having a latch end comprising a base and opposing sidewalls which combine to define a cavity configured to receive a head of a latch when the recloseable ring is secured in a closed position, the cavity being configured such that a radial cross section has a generally U-shape comprising two radiused corners each generally located between a separate one of the opposing walls and the base, the radiused corners adding strength to the connection between the base and the opposing sidewalls to allow the cavity to be deeper, relative to conventional recloseable rings, to allow for the head to be larger, relative to conventional recloseable rings, without increasing the overall radial thickness of the recloseable ring.</p>

This terminology include the words above specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, <b>7</b>A-<b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, and <b>13</b>-<b>17</b>, wherein like numerals indicate like elements throughout, a preferred embodiment of a recloseable ring according to the present invention is shown and designated <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The recloseable ring <b>50</b> is preferably formed by a durable, attractive material, such as gold. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that any suitable material can be used without departing from the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the recloseable ring <b>50</b> is generally formed by first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B and a latch <b>58</b>. The first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B each have a latch end <b>56</b> and a hinge end <b>54</b>. The hinge ends <b>54</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B are hingeably connected. The latch ends <b>56</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B are preferably detachably securable in an interlocked position by ramps (described below) and by the latch <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>, the latch ends <b>56</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B each include ramps that are sized to gently interlock the latch ends <b>56</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B. Specifically, the first shank portion <b>52</b>A includes first and second outer ramps <b>92</b>A, <b>92</b>B and the second shank portion <b>52</b>B includes first and second inner ramps <b>90</b>A, <b>90</b>B. While the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B are being closed, an alignment member <b>102</b> facilitates alignment of the latch ends <b>56</b>. When the recloseable ring <b>50</b> is closed to bring the latch ends <b>56</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B together, the outwardly facing surfaces of the first and second inner ramps <b>90</b>A, <b>90</b>B and the inwardly facing surfaces of the first and second inner ramps <b>92</b>A, <b>92</b>B abuttingly contact each other causing the ramps to slightly deform and then, interlock with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">To further secure the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B together, once the latch ends <b>56</b> are engaged, the latch <b>58</b> is moved into a closed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, when the latch <b>58</b> is in the closed position, a latch head <b>84</b> prevents the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B from being pulled apart. If the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B are pulled apart while the latch <b>58</b> is in the closed position, the latch head <b>84</b> moves into contact with a catch <b>110</b> to prevent separation. The catch <b>110</b> is located on the alignment member <b>102</b>. The latch head <b>84</b> includes a hook portion <b>85</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to remove the ring <b>50</b>, a tool <b>60</b> is used to depress a free end <b>62</b> of the latch <b>58</b> to disengage the latch head <b>84</b> from the cavity <b>82</b> in the first shank portion <b>52</b>A. A free end <b>62</b> of the latch <b>56</b> includes a stop <b>112</b> that is configured to abut shoulder <b>115</b> when the latch <b>56</b> is rotated a predetermined distance to prevent the latch <b>56</b> from over opening during removal of the ring <b>50</b>. Then, the first and second inner ramps <b>90</b>A, <b>90</b>B and the first and second outer ramps <b>92</b>A, <b>92</b>B are separated by pulling the latch ends <b>56</b> of the first and second shank portion <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B generally away from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7D-7G</figref>, a preferred method of forming the recloseable ring includes providing first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B. Each of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B have a hinge end <b>54</b> and a latch end <b>56</b>. The hinge end <b>54</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B are aligned so that the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B combine to form a bore <b>64</b> adapted to receive the hinge pin <b>66</b>. One of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B defines an opening <b>68</b> to the bore <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present invention includes inserting the hinge pin <b>66</b> into the bore <b>64</b>. It is preferred that the hinge pin <b>66</b> protrudes from each side of the recloseable ring <b>50</b> prior to the securing of the hinge pin <b>66</b> therein. The hinge pin <b>66</b> is welded to a portion of the bore <b>64</b> using laser <b>108</b> such that the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B are pivotally connected about the hinge end <b>54</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the latch end <b>56</b> of the second shank portion <b>52</b>B is shown prior to insertion of the latch <b>58</b> and the latch pin <b>76</b> are inserted therein. A crossbar <b>98</b> may be used to provide stability to the latch end <b>56</b> of the second shank portion <b>52</b>B. It is preferred, but not necessary, that the characteristics of the countersink <b>70</b> are generally the same as the countersinks used on the hinge end <b>54</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B. It is preferred that the opening <b>68</b> to the aperture <b>96</b> includes a countersink <b>70</b> that provides an increased area <b>72</b> for a weld to be formed by the laser welding.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It is preferred that the countersink <b>70</b> generally extend about the opening <b>68</b> of the aperture <b>96</b> through generally three quarters of a perimeter <b>74</b> of the opening <b>68</b>. It is preferred that the laser welding includes welding the latch pin <b>76</b> to the aperture <b>96</b> generally along the increased area <b>72</b> such that the end of the latch pin <b>76</b> that protrudes from the aperture <b>96</b> is melted and generally fills the countersink <b>70</b>. It is preferred, but not necessary that the latch pin <b>76</b> include an enlarged portion that overlies a portion of the countersink <b>70</b> prior to welding. This reduces the amount of the latch pin <b>76</b> that needs to be melted to fill the countersink <b>70</b> while providing additional surface area over which to weld the latch pin <b>76</b> to the second shank portion <b>52</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Laser welding the end of the latch pin <b>76</b> preferably includes the end of the latch pin <b>76</b> being generally flush with an outer surface of the second shank portion <b>52</b>B that defines the opening <b>68</b> after the laser welding is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Another preferred method of making the recloseable ring <b>50</b> of the present invention results in a recloseable ring <b>50</b> that has a thicker latch <b>58</b> (as measured radially) than conventional recloseable rings without having to increase an overall thickness of the recloseable ring. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, a thickness “T<sub>1</sub>” (measured in the radial direction) through the latch head <b>84</b> is increased without a corresponding increase in the thickness of the overall ring. The increase in thickness in the latch head <b>84</b> does not necessarily require that the length of the hook portion <b>85</b> be increased relative to conventional recloseable rings. When the latch head <b>84</b> is increased in thickness it is possible to make the portion of the latch <b>58</b> that overlies the cross bar <b>98</b> (i.e., the portion of the latch <b>58</b> that overlies the crossbar <b>98</b> when the latch <b>58</b> is closed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The thickening of this portion of the latch <b>58</b> strengthens the latch <b>58</b>. Conventional recloseable rings have a latch head thickness “T<sub>2</sub>” of zero point zero three eight (0.038 in.) inches. One preferred embodiment of the present invention has a latch head thickness “T<sub>1</sub>” greater than zero point zero three eight (0.038 in.) inches. More preferably, the thickness “T<sub>1</sub>” of the latch head <b>84</b> is generally between approximately zero point zero four (0.04 in.) and zero point zero five (0.05 in.) inches. Most preferably, the thickness “T<sub>1</sub>” of the latch head <b>84</b> is approximately zero point zero four seven (0.047 in.) inches.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The method includes providing a shank portion having a latch end <b>56</b> comprising a base <b>86</b> and opposing side walls <b>88</b>. The base <b>86</b> and opposing side walls <b>88</b> combine to define a cavity <b>82</b> configured to receive a head <b>84</b> of the latch <b>58</b> when the recloseable ring <b>50</b> is secured in a closed position. The cavity <b>82</b> is preferably configured such that a radial cross section has a generally U-shape (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) comprising two radiused corners R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>. Each of the radiused corners R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> is generally located between a separate one of the opposing walls <b>88</b> and the base <b>86</b>. The radiused corners R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> preferably have a radius of curvature of between approximately eight thousandths (0.008 in.) of an inch and approximately fifteen thousands (0.015 in.) of an inch. More preferably the radiused corners R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> have a radius of curvature of approximately one hundredth (0.01 in.) of an inch.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The radiused corners R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> add strength to the base <b>86</b> that allows the base <b>86</b> to be thinner and the cavity <b>82</b> to be deeper, relative to conventional recloseable rings (which only allow latch heads of a thickness of zero point zero three eight (0.038 in.) inches to be inserted therein), to allow the latch head <b>84</b> of the recloseable ring <b>50</b> of the present invention to be larger, relative to conventional recloseable rings, without increasing the overall radial thickness of the recloseable ring. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the thicker latch head <b>84</b> allows the portion of the latch <b>58</b> that overlies the crossbar <b>98</b> to be thicker, as measured along thickness “Y”. This strengthens the latch <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Conventional recloseable rings have a cavity base thickness, as measured in the radial direction, of approximately four hundredths (0.04 in.) of an inch. It is preferred that the base <b>86</b> of the recloseable ring <b>50</b> have a thickness, as measured in the radial direction of less than four hundredths (0.04 in.) of an inch. It is more preferred that the base <b>86</b> of the recloseable ring <b>50</b> have a thickness, as measured in the radial direction of less than thirty-five thousandths (0.035 in.) of an inch. It is most preferred that the base <b>86</b> of the recloseable ring <b>50</b> have a thickness, as measured in the radial direction of less than thirty-one thousandths (0.031 in.) of an inch.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is preferred, but not necessary, that the method also include forming the first and second shank portions to eliminate any gap between opposing walls <b>88</b> of the cavity <b>82</b> and a latch <b>58</b> that is received therein. The difference between the widths W<b>2</b> and W<b>1</b> between the opposing walls <b>88</b> shows the reduction in distance generally necessary to generally eliminate the gap between the opposing walls and the latch <b>58</b>. The width W<b>2</b> illustrates the distance between opposing side walls in a conventional recloseable ring. W<b>2</b> is zero point zero fiver four (0.054 in.) inches. The recloseable ring <b>50</b> of the present invention has reduced the distance between opposing walls <b>88</b> to widths W<b>1</b>. It is preferred that W<b>1</b> is approximately zero point zero five (0.05 in.) inches.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Another method of forming a recloseable ring <b>50</b> according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and includes the step of forming the hinge ends <b>54</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B with a taper <b>80</b> formed proximate to the hinge ends <b>54</b>. The taper <b>80</b> is substantially formed without any manual adjustment processes. It is preferred that the taper <b>80</b> is provided by improving the mold used to mold the piece that is cast into the shank portions. The tapered corners <b>80</b> of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B reduce the instances of pinching of the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B during the closing of the ring. While a preferred taper <b>80</b> is shown, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any suitable shaped tapered corners <b>80</b> that reduce pinching and scratching can be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, another method of the present invention includes a method of molding pieces for use in the casting of recloseable rings <b>50</b>. The method includes providing a mold <b>94</b> having a plurality of cavities <b>100</b> shaped for forming pieces for casting first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B for the recloseable ring <b>50</b>. The pieces for the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B are formed simultaneously using the mold <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The method preferably includes injecting a material into the plurality of cavities <b>100</b> and allowing the material to cure to form the pieces corresponding to the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B. The material is preferably a plastic suitable for use in both an injection molding process and a subsequent casting process. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that any suitable wax or polymer can be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. The pieces are preferably used to cast the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the mold may include cavities shaped to form a piece for a latch for the recloseable ring <b>50</b>. It is preferable that the pieces for the first and second shank portions <b>52</b>A, <b>52</b>B and the latch <b>58</b> are formed simultaneously using the mold <b>94</b>. It is preferred that a separate one of the molds is prepared for each ring size with each of the molds sized to compensate for shrinkage of the pieces. By designing a mold to construct all of the major components of the recloseable ring <b>50</b> simultaneously, any shrinkage in the resulting pieces used during the casting process is uniform. This results in a better alignment between the various components of the recloseable ring <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Another method of the present invention includes providing coordinated latches for various ring sizes for a recloseable ring <b>50</b> of a given thickness (i.e., width). The method includes dividing a given range of recloseable ring sizes into upper and lower ranges and providing a separate latch for each of the upper and lower ranges such that manual adjustment of the latches is substantially reduced. It is preferred that the upper range for recloseable ring sizes is between six point five (6.5) and eleven point five (11.5) and that the lower range for recloseable ring sizes is between two point five (2.5) and five point five (5.5).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, another method of the present invention preferably includes providing a shank portion having a latch end <b>56</b> comprising opposing side walls <b>88</b>. One of the opposing side walls <b>88</b> defines an aperture <b>96</b> for receiving a latch pin <b>76</b>. A latch <b>58</b> is provided for detachably securing the recloseable ring <b>50</b> in a closed position. The latch pin <b>74</b> is inserted into the aperture <b>96</b> and through the latch <b>58</b>. The latch pin <b>74</b> is laser welded to a portion of the aperture <b>96</b> such that the latch <b>58</b> is pivotally mounted on the latch pin <b>76</b>. It is preferred that the latch pin <b>76</b> is of a sufficient length that when the hinge pin <b>56</b> is initially fully inserted into the aperture <b>96</b>, an end of the latch pin <b>76</b> protrudes therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is recognized by those skilled in the art that changes may be made to the above described embodiments of the invention without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. For example, while the manufacturing of the recloseable ring is described as being produced using an injection molding process and a casting process, any suitable method of manufacture can be used. Accordingly the recloseable ring <b>50</b> can be manufactured using machining, CNC machinery, Steriolithography, or any other known means. Alternatively, the recloseable ring can be produced by hand without departing from the scope of the present invention. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but is intended to cover all modifications which are in within the spirit and scope of the invention as described by the above specification; as defined by the appended claims; and/or as shown in the attached drawings.</p>
