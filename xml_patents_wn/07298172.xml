<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-314056, filed on Sep. 5, 2003, Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-14413, filed on Jan. 22, 2004, and Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-65939, filed on Mar. 9, 2004, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit, an interface circuit, and an electronic instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, a high-speed serial transfer interface such as low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) has attracted attention as an interface standard aiming at reducing EMI noise or the like. In the high-speed serial transfer interface, data transfer is implemented by allowing a transmitter circuit to transmit serialized data using differential signals and a receiver circuit to differentially amplify the differential signals. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-314397 has disclosed a conventional technology relating to the high-speed serial transfer interface, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, since the high-speed serial transfer interface allows current to constantly flow through the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit, a reduction of power consumption is limited. On the other hand, data transfer cannot be performed if the path of the constant current is cut. Therefore, the technical subject is to realize setting and cancellation of a power-down mode in the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit conforming to the high-speed serial transfer interface.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transmitter circuit connected to a receiver circuit with differential signal lines interposed, the transmitter circuit comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">a current driver which current-drives the differential signal lines; and</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">a voltage driver which is electrically disconnected from at least one of the differential signal lines in a normal transfer mode, and is electrically connected to the at least one of the differential signal lines and voltage-drives the at least one of the differential signal lines in a power-down mode,</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">wherein the voltage driver outputs a power-down voltage for setting the receiver circuit to the power-down mode or a wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode of the receiver circuit, to the at least one of the differential signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a receiver circuit connected to a transmitter circuit which current-drives differential signal lines with the differential signal lines interposed, the receiver circuit comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a current/voltage conversion circuit which performs a current/voltage conversion based on a current which flows through the differential signal lines, and outputs first and second voltage signals which make up differential voltage signals;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">a comparator which compares the first and second voltage signals and outputs an output signal; and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a wakeup detection circuit which is set to a disabled state in a normal transfer mode and to an enabled state in a power-down mode, detects a wakeup voltage and outputs a signal used to cancel the power-down mode when the transmitter circuit has outputted the wakeup voltage to at least one of the differential signal lines by voltage drive.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a receiver circuit connected to a transmitter circuit which current-drives differential signal lines with the differential signal lines interposed, the receiver circuit comprising:</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a transmitter circuit connected to a receiver circuit with differential signal lines interposed, the transmitter circuit comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">a current driver which current-drives the differential signal lines; and</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">a voltage driver which is electrically disconnected from at least one of the differential signal lines in a normal transfer mode, and is electrically connected to the at least one of the differential signal lines and voltage-drives the at least one of the differential signal lines in a power-down mode,</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">wherein the voltage driver outputs a power-down voltage for setting the receiver circuit to the power-down mode or a wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode of the receiver circuit, to the at least one of the differential signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this transmitter circuit, the voltage driver is electrically disconnected from at least one of the differential signal lines in the normal transfer mode, and normal transfer is performed by allowing the current driver current-drives the differential signal lines. In the power-down mode, the voltage driver is electrically connected to the at least one of the differential signal lines. The voltage driver outputs the power-down voltage or the wakeup voltage to the differential signal line (at least one of first and second signal lines) by voltage drive. Therefore, it is unnecessary to provide a signal line for transferring the power-down voltage or the wakeup voltage separately from the differential signal lines. As a result, since the number of signal lines can be reduced, a reduction of the circuit scale, facilitation of mounting, and the like can be achieved while reducing power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this transmitter circuit, the current driver may transmit a power-down command to the receiver circuit by current-driving the differential signal lines in the normal transfer mode.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This makes it unnecessary to provide a signal line for transferring the power-down command separately from the differential signal lines. As a result, since the number of signal lines can be reduced, a reduction of the circuit scale and the like can be achieved while reducing power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this transmitter circuit, the current driver may include: a first current source disposed between a first output node for a first signal line of the differential signal lines and a first power supply; and a second current source disposed between a second output node for a second signal line of the differential signal lines and the first power supply; and the voltage driver may include: a voltage output circuit which outputs the power-down voltage or the wakeup voltage; and a switching element which is disposed between an output of the voltage output circuit and at least one of the first and second output nodes, turned OFF in the normal transfer mode and turned ON in the power-down mode.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This makes it possible to electrically disconnect between the voltage output circuit and the differential signal lines in the normal transfer mode, because the switching element is turned OFF. Since the switching element is turned ON in the power-down mode, the power-down voltage or the wakeup voltage from the voltage output circuit can be outputted to the at least one of the differential signal lines by voltage drive.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an interface circuit having differential signal lines, the interface circuit comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">the above-described transmitter circuit connected to a receiver circuit of a partner device with first differential signals line interposed to current-drive the first differential signal lines; and</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">another receiver circuit connected to another transmitter circuit of the partner device with second differential signal lines interposed, the transmitter circuit of the partner device current-driving the second differential signal lines,</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">wherein the receiver circuit of the interface circuit connected to the second differential signal lines includes a wakeup detection circuit, the wakeup detection circuit being set to a disabled state in the normal transfer mode, being set to an enabled state in the power-down mode, and detecting the wakeup voltage to output a signal used to cancel the power-down mode when the transmitter circuit of the partner device has outputted the wakeup voltage to at least one of the second differential signal lines by voltage drive.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This enables the receiver circuit of the partner device to be set to the power-down mode or enables the power-down mode of the receiver circuit of the partner device to be canceled, by outputting the power-down voltage or the wakeup voltage to the receiver circuit of the partner device. Moreover, the power-down mode of the receiver circuit of the interface circuit (or self device) can be canceled by detecting the wakeup voltage output from the transmitter circuit of the partner device by using the wakeup detection circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an interface circuit having differential signal lines, the interface circuit comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">the above-described transmitter circuit connected to a receiver circuit of a partner device with first differential signal lines interposed to current-drive the first differential signal lines; and</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">another receiver circuit connected to another transmitter circuit of the partner device with second differential signal lines interposed, the transmitter circuit of the partner device current-driving the second differential signal lines,</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">wherein the receiver circuit of the interface circuit connected to the second differential signal lines includes a wakeup detection circuit, the wakeup detection circuit outputting a wakeup signal when cancellation of the power-down mode is detected after the receiver circuit of the interface circuit has been set to the power-down mode by output of the power-down voltage to the at least one of the second differential signal lines from the transmitter circuit of the partner device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">This enables the receiver circuit of the partner device to be set to the power-down mode or enables the power-down mode of the receiver circuit of the partner device to be canceled, by outputting the power-down voltage or the wakeup voltage to the receiver circuit of the partner device. Moreover, when the power-down mode of the interface circuit (or self device) is canceled by the partner device, a logic circuit in a higher layer can be notified of the cancellation of the power-down mode by using the wakeup signal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a receiver circuit connected to a transmitter circuit which current-drives differential signal lines with the differential signal lines interposed, the receiver circuit comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">a current/voltage conversion circuit which performs a current/voltage conversion based on a current flowing through the differential signal lines, and outputs first and second voltage signals which form differential voltage signals;</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">a comparator which compares the first and second voltage signals and outputs an output signal; and</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">a wakeup detection circuit which is set to a disabled state in a normal transfer mode and to an enabled state in a power-down mode, detects a wakeup voltage and outputs a signal which is used to cancel the power-down mode when the transmitter circuit has outputted the wakeup voltage to at least one of the differential signal lines by voltage drive.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this normal transfer mode, normal transfer is implemented by the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator, and the wakeup detection circuit is set to the disabled state. In the power-down mode, the wakeup detection circuit is set to the enabled state. The power-down mode can be canceled by allowing the wakeup detection circuit to detect the wakeup voltage output from the transmitter circuit. Therefore, the power-down mode can be canceled by detecting the wakeup voltage output to the at least one of the differential signal lines without providing a signal line for transferring the wakeup voltage separately from the differential signal lines. As a result, since the number of signal lines can be reduced, a reduction of the circuit scale, facilitation of mounting, and the like can be achieved while reduction of power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">This receiver circuit may further comprise:</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">a power-down detection circuit which detects a power-down command based on a comparison result from the comparator when the transmitter circuit has transmitted the power-down command by current-driving the differential signal lines in the normal transfer mode; and</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">a power-down setting circuit which sets at least one of the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator to the power-down mode and sets the wakeup detection circuit to an enabled state, when the power-down detection circuit has detected the power-down command.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this receiver circuit, the transmitter circuit transmits the power-down command to the receiver circuit by current-driving the differential signal lines. The power-down command is detected based on the comparison result from the comparator (or an output signal of the comparator, a signal generated by subjecting the output signal of the comparator to predetermined processing such as serial/parallel conversion or the like). When the power-down command is detected, at least one of the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator is set to the power-down mode, whereby a reduction of power consumption is implemented. Moreover, the wakeup detection circuit can be set to the enabled state. In this way, the power-down command transmitted by current-driving the differential signal lines is detected, and the power-down mode is thus set. Therefore, it is unnecessary to provide a signal line for transferring the power-down command separately from the differential signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this receiver circuit, the power-down setting circuit may include a holding circuit which holds power-down setting information when the power-down command is detected, until the power-down mode is canceled; and the power-down setting circuit may set at least one of the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator to the power-down mode and set the wakeup detection circuit to the enabled state when the power-down setting information is held by the holding circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">This enables the power-down mode to be maintained insofar as the power-down setting information is held by the holding circuit, whereby a stable power-down operation can be implemented. Moreover, the power-down mode can be canceled merely by clearing the power-down setting information held by the holding circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this receiver circuit, the power-down setting circuit may cancel the power-down mode, set at least one of the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator to the normal transfer mode, and set the wakeup detection circuit to a disabled state when the wakeup voltage is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This enables the normal transfer using the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator to be resumed by canceling the power-down mode. Moreover, since the wakeup detection circuit is set to the disabled state, occurrence of an erroneous detection operation can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this receiver circuit, the transmitter circuit connected to the receiver circuit with the differential signal lines interposed may transmit a plurality of power-down commands by current-driving the differential signal lines; and the power-down setting circuit may set at least one of the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator to the power-down mode when the power-down detection circuit detects the plurality of power-down commands.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">This enables a stable power-down operation to be implemented even when a transfer error or the like occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this receiver circuit, the transmitter circuit may transfer a special code obtained by using an encoding method which expands a bit width, as the power-down command; and the power-down detection circuit may detect the power-down command by detecting the special code.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This facilitates transmission of the power-down command.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a receiver circuit connected to a transmitter circuit which current-drives differential signal lines with the differential signal lines interposed, the receiver circuit comprising:</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">a wakeup detection circuit which outputs a wakeup signal when cancellation of a power-down mode is detected after setting of the receiver circuit to a power-down mode by outputting a power-down voltage to at least one of the differential signal lines from the transmitter circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this receiver circuit, normal transfer is implemented by the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator in the normal transfer mode. When the transmitter circuit outputs the power-down voltage to at least one of the differential signal lines, the receiver circuit is set to the power-down mode. When the power-down mode of the receiver circuit is canceled by the transmitter circuit, a logic circuit or the like in a higher layer can be notified of the cancellation of the power-down mode by using the wakeup signal.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this receiver circuit, the transmitter circuit transmits the power-down command to the receiver circuit by current-driving the differential signal lines. This enables the receiver circuit to make preparations for transition to the power-down mode. The transmitter circuit then transmits the power-down voltage to the at least one of the differential signal lines by voltage drive. This causes at least one of the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator to be set to the power-down mode, whereby a reduction of power consumption is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this receiver circuit, the wakeup detection circuit may make the wakeup signal active when a voltage level of the at least one of the differential signal lines changes from a power-down voltage level to another voltage level after the power-down command has been detected and an output signal of the power-down detection circuit has been made active.</p>

In this embodiment, a host device <b>10</b> is the side which supplies a clock signal, and a target device <b>30</b> is the side which operates using the supplied clock signal as a system clock signal.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, DTO+ and DTO− are data (OUT data) output to the target device <b>30</b> (device in a broad sense) from the host device <b>10</b> (device in a broad sense). CLK+ and CLK− are clock signals supplied to the target device <b>30</b> from the host device <b>10</b>. The host device <b>10</b> outputs the data DTO+/− in synchronization with the edge (rising edge or falling edge) of the clock signals CLK+/−. Therefore, the target device <b>30</b> can sample and capture the data DTO+/− using the clock signals CLK+/−. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the target device <b>30</b> operates based on the clock signals CLK+/− supplied from the host device <b>10</b>.

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">4. Operation</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The operation in the first configuration example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is described below using waveform charts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The operation in the normal transfer mode is described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the signal PDIN is set at the L level in the normal transfer mode, the transistor TR<b>2</b>A is in the OFF state. Since the power-down signal PD is set at the L level, the transistors TR<b>3</b>A and TR<b>3</b>B are in the ON state. The voltage driver <b>70</b> is electrically disconnected from the differential signal lines when the transistor TR<b>2</b>A is turned OFF. A normal operating current flows through the current/voltage conversion circuit <b>90</b> when the transistors TR<b>3</b>A and TR<b>3</b>B are turned ON, whereby the normal transfer can be implemented. Specifically, the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> becomes equivalent to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the normal transfer mode, the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit operate as described below. When the transistors TR<b>1</b>A and TR<b>1</b>B are in the OFF state, the input nodes NIA and NIB are set at a voltage of about 1 V, for example. When the transistor TR<b>1</b>A on the side of the DTO+ signal line is turned ON, current flows toward the power supply VSS (GND) through the differential signal lines. This causes the voltage of the input node NIA to be decreased to only a small extent. As a result, the voltage of the input node NIA is reversed by the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>A and the output voltage of the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>A is increased, whereby the ON-resistance of the transistor TR<b>4</b>A is decreased. This increases the amount of current which flows through the transistor TR<b>5</b>A. Therefore, the voltage difference between the power supply VDD and the voltage output node NVA (voltage between the drain and source of the transistor TR<b>5</b>A) is increased, whereby the voltage of the voltage output node NVA is decreased. When the transistor TR<b>1</b>B on the side of the DTO− signal line is turned ON, the voltage of the voltage output node NVB is decreased. Therefore, the data “0” or “1” is detected by allowing the comparator <b>100</b> to compare and amplify the voltage difference between the voltage output nodes NVA and NVB.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The operation during power-down command transmission is described below. At A<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the transmitter circuit transmits the power-down command to the receiver circuit. In this embodiment, since the power-down command is transmitted in the normal transfer mode in which the differential signal lines are current-driven, it is unnecessary to provide an extra signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As indicated by A<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the transmitter circuit may transmit a plurality of power-down commands by current-driving the differential signal lines. The power-down setting circuit <b>120</b> may set the current/voltage conversion circuit <b>90</b> and the comparator <b>100</b> in the power-down mode on condition that a plurality of power-down commands are detected.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A problem in which the receiver circuit <b>80</b> is erroneously set to the power-down mode can be prevented, even when a transfer error occurs, by transmitting and detecting a plurality of power-down commands. Specifically, if the receiver circuit <b>80</b> is erroneously set to the power-down mode, it is difficult for the receiver circuit <b>80</b> to recover from the power-down mode. However, such a problem can be prevented by transmitting and detecting a plurality of power-down commands.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The operation at the time of power-down setting is described below. As indicated by A<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the transistor TR<b>2</b>A is turned ON when the signal PDIN is set at the H level, whereby the voltage driver <b>70</b> is electrically connected to the differential signal lines. The voltage driver <b>70</b> outputs a voltage at the H level of the CMOS voltage level to the differential signal lines as indicated by A<b>4</b>, whereby the transistor TR<b>4</b>A is turned OFF. An unnecessary current can be prevented from flowing through the path from the transistor TR<b>5</b>A to the voltage output circuit <b>72</b> through the transistor TR<b>4</b>A, the DTO+ signal line, and the transistor TR<b>2</b>A by causing the transistor TR<b>4</b>A to be turned OFF, whereby power consumption can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">When the transmitter circuit transmits the power-down command, a power-down pulse signal PDPLS becomes active (L level) after the period TD<b>1</b> has elapsed as indicated by A<b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

As indicated by A<b>6</b>, the power-down signal PD becomes active after the period TD<b>2</b> has elapsed. The period TD<b>2</b> can be adjusted by the delay circuit <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">When the signal PD becomes active, the transistors TR<b>3</b>A and TR<b>3</b>B are turned OFF, and the comparator <b>100</b> is set to the disabled state. Therefore, the operating current which constantly flows through the current/voltage conversion circuit <b>90</b> and the comparator <b>100</b> can be cut, whereby power consumption can be reduced. Moreover, since the wakeup detection circuit <b>130</b> is set to the enabled state, the wakeup voltage output to the differential signal lines can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The operation at the time of power-down cancellation is described below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

When canceling the power-down mode, the voltage output circuit <b>72</b> outputs the wakeup voltage at the L level of the CMOS voltage level to the DTO+ signal line as indicated by B<b>2</b>. The signal PDIN is set at the L level after the period TD<b>3</b> has elapsed, whereby the transistor TR<b>2</b>A is turned OFF and the voltage output circuit <b>72</b> is disconnected from the DTO+ signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">When the wakeup voltage is output, the wakeup detection circuit <b>130</b> set to the enabled state detects the wakeup voltage, and sets the signal XWUPPLS at the L level as indicated by B<b>4</b>. This causes the holding circuit <b>122</b> to be reset to the logic “0”, and the power-down signal PD is set at the L level after the period TD<b>4</b> has elapsed, as indicated by B<b>5</b>. This causes the transistors TR<b>3</b>A and TR<b>3</b>B to be turned ON and the comparator <b>100</b> to be set to the enabled state, whereby the power-down mode is canceled. The wakeup detection circuit <b>130</b> is set to the disabled state.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">5. Transmission of Power-down Command Using Special Code</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In this embodiment, encoding circuits <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> may be respectively provided in the host device <b>10</b> and the target device <b>30</b> (transmitter circuit), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The encoding circuits <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> encode the data using an encoding method which expands the bit width, for example. As the encoding method, an 8B/10B encoding method in which 8-bit data is converted into 10-bit data can be given, for example. According to the 8B/10B encoding method, even if the data continuously contains “0” or “1”, a change in bits of the signal is increased after encoding as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, whereby occurrence of transfer errors due to noise or the like can be reduced. According to the 8B/10B encoding method, since the bit width is expanded from 8 bits to 10 bits, a special code (similar to control code) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> can be transmitted in addition to data.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In this embodiment, the power-down command is assigned to the special code and transmitted, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The power-down command is detected by detecting the special code to which the power-down command is assigned by the decode processing of the command decoder <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Occurrence of transfer errors can be reduced by effectively utilizing the encoding method. Moreover, transmission and detection of the power-down command can be easily implemented by current-driving the differential signal lines. Furthermore, data transfer can be performed by assigning the special code to the start code or the end code of a packet.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">It suffices that the encoding method performed by the encoding circuit <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> be encoding which expands the bit width, and the encoding method is not limited to the 8B/10B encoding.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">6. Power-down Mode Setting of Clock Transfer Receiver Circuit</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">According to this embodiment, the transmitter circuits <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> can separately set the corresponding receiver circuits <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> in the power-down mode in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therefore, the power-down command for setting the clock transfer receiver circuit <b>44</b> in the power-down mode or the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode may be transferred through the CLK+/− differential signal lines. The power-down command for setting the strobe transfer (clock transfer in a broad sense) receiver circuit <b>28</b> in the power-down mode or the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode may be transferred through the STB+/− differential signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the frequency (band) of the signals transmitted through the CLK+/− and STB+/− differential signal lines is higher than the frequency of the signals transmitted through the DTO+/− and DTI+/− differential signal lines. Therefore, if the power-down detection circuit, the power-down setting circuit, and the voltage driver described in this embodiment are provided on the side of the CLK+/− and STB+/− differential signal lines, transfer performance such as the transfer rate and transfer reliability may be adversely affected. In particular, if the voltage driver is provided on the side of the CLK+/− and STB+/− differential signal lines, the parasitic capacitance of the drain terminal or the gate terminal of the transistor may be added to the differential signal lines, whereby the transfer performance may be adversely affected.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Therefore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the power-down command for setting the clock transfer receiver circuit <b>44</b> in the power-down mode (hereinafter called “clock transfer power-down command”) and the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode (hereinafter called “clock transfer wakeup voltage”) are transmitted through the OUT transfer DTO+/− differential signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Specifically, when setting the clock transfer receiver circuit <b>44</b> in the power-down mode, the OUT transfer transmitter circuit <b>22</b> transmits the clock transfer power-down command to the OUT transfer receiver circuit <b>42</b> through the DTO+/− differential signal lines. The power-down setting circuit included in the OUT transfer receiver circuit <b>42</b> outputs the power-down signal to the clock transfer receiver circuit <b>44</b> when the clock transfer power-down command is detected as the power-down command transmitted through the DTO+/− differential signal lines. This causes the current/voltage conversion circuit and the comparator included in the clock transfer receiver circuit <b>44</b> to be set to the power-down mode.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">When canceling the power-down mode of the clock transfer receiver circuit <b>44</b>, the OUT transfer transmitter circuit <b>22</b> (voltage driver) outputs the wakeup voltage to the DTO+/− differential signal lines.

<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The above-described configuration makes it unnecessary to transmit the power-down command or the wakeup voltage through the CLK+/− differential signal lines. Therefore, the transfer performance of the clock transfer performed through the CLK+/− differential signal lines can be prevented from being adversely affected.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The power-down command for setting the strobe transfer receiver circuit <b>26</b> in the power-down mode or the wakeup voltage for canceling the power-down mode may be transferred through the IN transfer DTI+/− differential signal lines. The power-down command for setting the clock transfer receiver circuit in the power-down mode and the power-down command for setting the data transfer receiver circuit in the power-down mode may be commands in different codes or commands in the same code.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">7. Details of Power-down Control</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The details of the power-down control are described below. In this embodiment, various states are defined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, a device disabled state is a state in which the entire electronic instrument (host device and target device) is set to the power-down mode. A target disabled state (period T<b>1</b>) is a state in which the supply of the clock signal from the host device to the target device is terminated and all the functions of the target device are stopped. The supply of the clock signal is terminated after the device has entered the target disabled state.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">An OUT idle state (period T<b>2</b>) is the idle state of the OUT transfer (transfer from the host device to the target device) (state between packet transfers). In the OUT idle state, since the host-side transmitter circuit and the target-side receiver circuit are not set to the power-down mode, the normal transfer can be immediately performed. Since current constantly flows through these circuits, electric power is consumed. An OUT transfer state (period T<b>3</b>) is a state in which the OUT transfer is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">An OUT disabled state (period T<b>4</b>) is a state in which the OUT transfer is terminated. In this state, the current which has been constantly flowing through the host-side transmitter circuit and the target-side receiver circuit is terminated by the power-down mode, whereby a reduction of power consumption is implemented. The power-down mode can be canceled by allowing the host-side transmitter circuit to output the wakeup voltage to the target-side receiver circuit, whereby the transfer which has been terminated can be resumed.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">An IN idle state (period T<b>5</b>) is an idle state of the IN transfer (transfer from the target device to the host device). In the IN idle state, since the target-side transmitter circuit and the host-side receiver circuit are not set to the power-down mode, the normal transfer can be immediately performed. Since current constantly flows through these circuits, electric power is consumed. An IN transfer state (period T<b>6</b>) is a state in which the IN transfer is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">An IN disabled state (period T<b>7</b>) is a state in which the IN transfer is terminated. In this state, the current which has been constantly flowing through the target-side transmitter circuit and the host-side receiver circuit is terminated by the power-down mode, whereby a reduction of power consumption is implemented. The power-down mode can be canceled by allowing the target-side transmitter circuit to output the wakeup voltage to the host-side receiver circuit, whereby the transfer which has been terminated can be resumed.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a “host function” indicates the system function of the host, a “target CLKIN” indicates the presence or absence of the clock input to the target device, and a “target function” indicates the system function of the target. A “DTO transmission” indicates the DTO+/− transmission function of the host, and a “DTI reception” indicates the DTI+/− reception function of the host. A “DTI transmission” indicates the DTI+/− transmission function of the target, and a “DTO reception” indicates the DTO+/− reception function of the target. A “CLK transmission” indicates the CLK+/− transmission function, and a “CLK reception” indicates the CLK+/− reception function. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a symbol “◯” indicates that these functions are in the enabled state (operating state), and a symbol “×” indicates that these functions are in the disabled state (power-down state). A symbol “−” indicates “don't care”. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, “S” indicates the start code of packet transfer, and “E” indicates the end code of packet transfer.

In the target disabled state at C<b>4</b>, the supply of the clock signals CLK+/− is terminated as indicated by C<b>5</b>, whereby all the functions of the target device are terminated.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">According to this embodiment, each transmitter circuit can individually set the corresponding receiver circuit in the power-down mode or cancel the power-down mode.

<p id="p-0179" num="0178">When the power-down command is detected by the power-down detection circuit <b>110</b> and the transmitter circuit outputs the power-down voltage to the differential signal lines (DTO+ or DTO−), the power-down setting circuit <b>120</b> sets the current/voltage conversion circuit <b>90</b> and the comparator <b>100</b> in the power-down mode. In more detail, the power-down setting circuit <b>120</b> includes an AND circuit AND<b>1</b>. When the target-side power-down signal TPDW from the power-down signal generation circuit <b>115</b> and a host-side power-down signal HPDW, of which the voltage level changes corresponding to the state of the differential signal lines, are set at the H level (active), the power-down setting circuit <b>120</b> outputs the power-down signal PD at the H level (active). When the power-down signal PD is set at the H level, the comparator <b>100</b> is set to the disabled state and the transistors TR<b>3</b>A and TR<b>3</b>B are turned OFF, whereby the receiver circuit is set to the power-down mode.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The wakeup detection circuit <b>130</b> detects cancellation of the power-down mode and outputs the wakeup signal TWUP.

<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In the first configuration example, when the transmitter circuit outputs the wakeup voltage at the L level as indicated by B<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the signal PD is set at the L level as indicated by B<b>5</b>, whereby the power-down mode of the receiver circuit is canceled.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In the second configuration example, when the supply of the power-down voltage to the differential signal lines by the transmitter circuit is terminated as indicated by E<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the signal PD is set at the L level as indicated by E<b>4</b>, whereby the power-down mode of the receiver circuit is canceled. The wakeup signal TWUP is then set at the H level as indicated by E<b>5</b>, whereby the higher layer logic circuit in the subsequent stage is awakened.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Specifically, in the first configuration example, the power-down mode is set merely on condition that the power-down command is detected. Therefore, the delay circuit for setting up the periods TD<b>1</b> and TD<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is necessary. This is because the holding circuit <b>122</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is reset if the timing at which the differential signal lines are set at the H level indicated by A<b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is later than the timing at which the pulse signal PDPLS is set at the L level indicated by A<b>5</b>, whereby the power-down mode is canceled. Since the transmitter circuit cannot know the signal delay state of the receiver circuit, the timing adjustment becomes complicated if such a delay circuit is provided, whereby the sequence design becomes difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In the second configuration example, the power-down mode is not set even if the power-down command is merely detected as indicated by D<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, and the power-down mode is set on condition that the transmitter circuit outputs the power-down voltage after the power-down command has been detected as indicated by D<b>3</b> and D<b>4</b>. Specifically, preparations for transition to the power-down mode are made on condition that the power-down command is detected, and the transition to the power-down mode occurs on condition that the output of the power-down voltage is detected. This makes it unnecessary to provide a delay circuit, which is necessary in the first configuration example, whereby the timing adjustment can be simplified and the sequence design can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In the second configuration example, the wakeup signal TWUP must remain at the L level at the timing indicated by D<b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, and the wakeup signal TWUP must be set at the H level at the timing indicated by E<b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. However, the signal HPDW is set at the L level and the signal TPDW is set at the H level in the period TA<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and the period TA<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Specifically, the signal state is the same in the period TA<b>1</b> and the period TA<b>2</b>. Since the clock signal is terminated in the period between the timing indicated by D<b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and the timing indicated by E<b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the period TA<b>1</b> and the period TA<b>2</b> must be distinguished only by the signal state.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Therefore, in the second configuration example, the wakeup detection circuit <b>130</b> having the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is provided. Specifically, in the second configuration example, the period TA<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and the period TA<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> can be distinguished by allowing the RS flip-flop circuits (NAND<b>1</b>, NAND<b>2</b>) of the wakeup detection circuit <b>130</b> to hold the voltage states of the nodes NA and NB. As described above, the wakeup detection circuit <b>130</b> is a circuit which sets the wakeup signal TWUP at the H level (active) when the voltage level of the differential signal lines changes from the power-down voltage (H level, for example) to another voltage level (1 V, for example) (when the signal HPDW changes from the H level to the L level) after the power-down command has been detected and the output signal TPDW from the power-down detection circuit <b>110</b> has been set at the H level (active). This circuit prevents the wakeup signal TWUP from being set at the H level at the timing indicated by D<b>8</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and causes the wakeup signal TWUP to be set at the H level at the timing indicated by E<b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">9. Third Configuration Example</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">A detailed third configuration example of the transmitter circuit and the receiver circuit according to one embodiment of the present invention is described below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the configuration and operation of the circuit block denoted by the same symbol as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref> are almost the same as those in the first and second configuration examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>. Therefore, description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The third configuration example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> differs from the second configuration example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> in the configuration of the transmitter circuit. In more detail, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the current driver <b>60</b> (first and second current sources) of the transmitter circuit includes N-type (first conductivity type) transistors TR<b>11</b>A and TR<b>12</b>A and a current source IHS. The current driver <b>60</b> includes N-type (first conductivity type) transistors TR<b>11</b>B and TR<b>12</b>B and a current source ILS.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The transistor TR<b>11</b>A is provided between the output node NQA and the current source IHS. In more detail, the input signal DIN+ is input to a gate terminal of the transistor TR<b>11</b>A, the output node NQA is connected to a drain terminal of the transistor TR<b>11</b>A, and the current source IHS is connected to a source terminal of the transistor TR<b>11</b>A. The transistor TR<b>12</b>A is provided between the output node NQB and the current source IHS. In more detail, the input signal DIN− is input to a gate terminal of the transistor TR<b>12</b>A, the output node NQB is connected to a drain terminal of the transistor TR<b>12</b>A, and the current source IHS is connected to a source terminal of the transistor TR<b>12</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The transistor TR<b>11</b>B is provided between the output node NQA and the current source ILS. In more detail, the input signal DIN− is input to a gate terminal of the transistor TR<b>11</b>B, the output node NQA is connected to a drain terminal of the transistor TR<b>11</b>B, and the current source ILS is connected to a source terminal of the transistor TR<b>11</b>B. The transistor TR<b>12</b>B is provided between the output node NQB and the current source ILS. In more detail, the input signal DIN− is input to a gate terminal of the transistor TR<b>12</b>B, the output node NQB is connected to a drain terminal of the transistor TR<b>12</b>B, and the current source ILS is connected to a source terminal of the transistor TR<b>12</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The current source IHS is provided between the transistors TR<b>11</b>A and TR<b>12</b>A and the power supply VSS (first power supply). The current source IHS is a current source which can generate current (500 μA, for example) greater than that of the current source ILS, and may be formed by a transistor to which a first reference voltage is input at a gate terminal, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The current source ILS is provided between the transistors TR<b>11</b>B and TR<b>12</b>B and the power supply VSS (first power supply). The current source ILS is a current source which can generate current (100 μA, for example) smaller than that of the current source IHS, and may be formed by a transistor to which a second reference voltage lower than the first reference voltage is input at a gate terminal, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">When the input signal DIN+ becomes active (H level) and the input signal DIN− becomes inactive (L level), the transistors TR<b>11</b>A and TR<b>12</b>B are turned ON and the transistors TR<b>12</b>A and TR<b>11</b>B are turned OFF. This causes a large amount of current (500 μA, for example) to flow through the DTO+ signal line and a small amount of current (100 μA, for example) to flow through the DTO− signal line. When the input signal DIN+ becomes inactive (L level) and the input signal DIN− becomes active (H level), the transistors TR<b>11</b>A and TR<b>12</b>B are turned OFF and the transistors TR<b>12</b>A and TR<b>11</b>B are turned ON. This causes a small amount of current to flow through the DTO+ signal line and a large amount of current to flow through the DTO− signal line.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>A (INV<b>1</b>B) is formed by N-type (first conductivity type) transistors TR<b>20</b> and TR<b>21</b> connected in series between the power supply VDD and the power supply VSS. The power supply VDD (second power supply) is connected to a gate terminal of the transistor TR<b>20</b>, and the input node NIA (NIB) is connected to a gate terminal of the transistor TR<b>21</b>. A load resistor may be used instead of the transistor TR<b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>A (INV<b>1</b>B) is formed by a P-type (second conductivity type) transistor TR<b>22</b> and an N-type (first conductivity type) transistor TR<b>23</b> connected in series between the power supply VDD and the power supply VSS. The input node NIA (NIB) is connected to gate terminals of the transistors TR<b>22</b> and TR<b>23</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>A (INV<b>1</b>B) is formed by an operational amplifier OP. A reference voltage VREF is input to a first input (negative side) of the operational amplifier OP, and the input node NIA (NIB) is connected to a second input (negative side) of the operational amplifier OP.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>11</b>, and <b>14</b>, the circuit formed by the transistor TR<b>4</b>A (TR<b>4</b>B) and the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>A (INV<b>1</b>B) functions as a low-impedance generation circuit. A specific impedance (Z<b>0</b>) of the DTO+ (DTO−) differential signal lines can be matched with the input impedance of the receiver circuit by complementing the impedance (Z<b>2</b>) of the resistor RA (RB) to the impedance (Z<b>1</b>) generated by the low-impedance generation circuit (Z<b>0</b>=Z<b>1</b>+Z<b>2</b>). The length of the differential signal lines or the like is changed depending on the type of an electronic instrument, whereby the specific impedance of the differential signal lines may be changed. In this case, it is preferable that the resistor RA (RB) be a variable resistor. This enables the circuit formed by the low-impedance generation circuit (circuit consisting of the transistor TR<b>4</b>A and the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>A or the circuit consisting of the transistor TR<b>4</b>B and the inverter circuit INV<b>1</b>B) and the resistor RA (RB) to function as an impedance adjustment circuit. Therefore, impedance matching can be performed even if the specific impedance of the differential signal lines is changed. The resistor RA (RB) may not be provided when the specific impedance of the differential signal lines is low and impedance matching can be performed only by the input impedance of the low-impedance generation circuit, for example.</p>
