<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of co-pending non-provisional application Ser. No. 10/263,067 filed Oct. 1, 2002 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE CONTROLLED FORMATION OF CAVITATION BUBBLES USING TARGET BUBBLES, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,932,914, which claims the benefit of provisional application No. 60/350,849 filed Jan. 18, 2002 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE CONTROLLED FORMATION OF CAVITATION BUBBLES, and claims benefit thereof. The aforementioned applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to the formation and control of individual micron size and submicron size cavitation bubbles for use in nanofabrication operations. More particularly, embodiments of the invention teach methods and apparatus for control of a re-entrant micro-jet formed upon collapse of an individual or array of cavitation bubbles and directing the impact of the micro-jet toward a work surface or other objects with a high degree of precision.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the production of cavitation has been a phenomena many have tried to avoid. Cavitation in a liquid is the formation, growth, and collapse of gaseous and vapor bubbles due to the reduction of pressure below the vapor pressure of the liquid at the working temperature. Pump impellers, boat props, and similar applications experience cavitation which can produce rapid damage and erosion of surfaces. It has been well known for many years that ultrasonic cleaning devices, which function by the creation of cavitation bubbles, can produce significant surface damage to even the hardest of materials. Studies by a number of authors have revealed that one significant element in producing the damage caused by cavitation occurs when a cavitation bubble collapses in the vicinity of a surface, launching what is called a re-entrant micro-jet toward the surface. This liquid jet can produce velocities as high as 1500 m/s, and is capable of damaging the hardest materials known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, a number of applications have been developed utilizing the formation of cavitation bubbles through the use of laser light or electrical discharge. Esch et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,543) and Herbert et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,400) disclose the use of laser light introduced into a catheter device for the purpose of creating cavitation bubbles, whose expansion and collapse are utilized to pump fluids in and out of the catheter. Hammer et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,676) discloses a laser surgical probe with a special lens designed to produce the cavitation bubbles further from the end of the fiber optics, to reduce the damage formed (presumably by the re-entrant micro-jets launching into the lens on the end of the cable). Such damage was also reported by Rol et al. in “Q Switched Pulses and Optical Breakdown Generation. Through Optical Fibers”, <i>Laser and Light in Opthalmology</i>, Vol. 3, No. 3, 1990. Palanker (U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,998) describes a method for performing electrosurgery using sub-microsecond, high power electrical pulses are applied to an electrosurgical probe interface. The tool described by Palanker provides a cutting force by both the plasma generated by the electrical arc and shock waves produced by collapsing cavitation bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In each of the prior art references cited above, there has been no attempt to control the direction and impact of the powerful micro-jets formed upon the collapse of the cavitation bubbles created when highly focused energy is introduced into a liquid. Without such control, concern of collateral damage cannot be avoided, especially when such tools are used in the human body in a medical application.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently as well, there has been a significant interest generated in the field of nanotechnology, for methods needed to fabricate micron and submicron devices and nanomachines. There are very few fabrication tools available that can cut, drill, peen, deform, or otherwise modify features of a surface on a submicron to nanometer scale. Much of the technology developed by the semiconductor industry requires the fabrication of structures utilizing photolithographic processing. This technology is not as flexible as may be required, and will have certain difficulties when applied to biological nanotechnology systems. Advancing the state of the art required by nanotechnology applications will require fabrication technologies operating at least 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below that capable in the semiconductor process arena.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention as described in the above referenced provisional application provides a method for the controlled formation of individual cavitation bubbles comprising immersing a mask including at least one aperture within a liquid, immersing a work piece having a work surface in the liquid proximate to the mask, generating a cavitation bubble proximate to the aperture such that the mask is located between the cavitation bubble and the work piece. A re-entrant micro-jet formed during the collapse of the cavitation bubble is directed through the aperture to the work surface. An apparatus for the controlled formation of cavitation bubbles as described in the above referenced provisional application discloses a mask having at least one aperture, immersed in a liquid, and an energy source having an energy flow in the liquid sufficient to create at least one cavitation bubble. The energy flow creates the cavitation bubble proximate to the aperture and the collapse of the cavitation bubble creates a re-entrant micro-jet directed through the aperture to a work surface. While this technique is very useful for processing surfaces that can be located conveniently in the vicinity of a fixed orifice, there are many other situations where one may wish dynamic, three dimensional control of the direction of the re-entrant micro-jet. These situations may include eye surgery, for example, where placing an orifice structure inside the eye may not be practical.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The prior state of the art therefore has yet to provide a fabrication technology capable of operating in the nanometer region by harnessing the powerful phenomena of the re-entrant micro-jet formed during the collapse of a precisely located cavitation bubble. What is further needed is a method and apparatus to precisely control the direction and location of the re-entrant micro jet without the encumbrance of physical structure such an orifice between the work surface and the cavitation bubble.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides a method for the directed formation of a re-entrant micro-jet including generating a working cavitation bubble proximate to a work surface and generating a target bubble between the work surface and the working cavitation bubble, wherein a re-entrant micro-jet formed upon the collapse of the working cavitation bubble is directed to the work surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An apparatus for the directed formation of a re-entrant micro-jet in accordance with the present invention includes a first energy source having an energy flow in the liquid sufficient to create a working cavitation bubble proximate to a work surface and a second energy source having a second energy flow in the liquid sufficient to create a target cavitation bubble between the work surface and the working cavitation bubble. The re-entrant micro-jet formed upon the collapse of the working cavitation bubble is directed to the work surface.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The control and direction of the re-entrant micro-jet formed during the collapse of a cavitation bubble can provide a powerful tool for performing various fabrication and manipulation functions at a submicron and nanometer scale. A previous application (60/350,849 filed Jan. 18, 2002 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE CONTROLLED FORMATION OF CAVITATION BUBBLES) describes how these re-entrant micro-jets may be controlled through the use of an orifice placed between the work surface and the collapsing cavitation bubble. While the aforementioned techniques shall prove very useful for fabrication processes where the work surface can be placed in proximity to an orifice structure, there may be other applications where placing such a structure will be difficult or impossible. One example might be surgery inside the human eye, where a surgeon might wish to generate re-entrant micro-jets in the humus by focussing laser beams through the cornea. Another example might be to cut features into the side wall of micron sized pores in an integrated circuit structure where fabricating and placing submicron orifice structures would be very difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present invention teaches a technique by which the re-entrant micro-jet formed during the collapse of a cavitation bubble (working bubble) can be directed by the creation of a target bubble within a given proximity of the collapsing working bubble. Target bubbles can be created in any direction in 3d space relative to the center of the working bubble. All that is required is that there be a clear line of sight (relative to the radiation source needed to create the bubble) to the projected position of the target bubble, that the target bubble is formed within a given time period of the collapse of the working bubble, and that the target bubble be within a given proximity of the working bubble. The target bubble serves to attract the re-entrant micro-jet by creating a hydrodynamic condition similar to that of a solid work surface or an orifice. However, the target bubbles, unlike solid work surfaces, are transparent to the jets, and allow the jets to slice through them unimpeded. Target bubbles can therefore be used to direct the powerful re-entrant micro-jets toward a work surface or object without the need for an orifice. To be effective, a target bubble should be within approximately 6 working bubble diameters of the working bubble. A working bubble diameter is defined as the maximum diameter obtained by the working bubble just prior to collapse.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross sectional view of an apparatus <b>100</b> for generating target bubbles <b>102</b> and cavitation bubbles <b>104</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. A work piece <b>132</b> is placed in a container <b>134</b> filled with fluid <b>130</b>. Components <b>108</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>138</b> make up the focussed laser device for creating the target bubble <b>102</b>. Components <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>136</b> make up the focussed laser device for creating the cavitation working bubble <b>104</b>. The lasers <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> may be chosen from among the group of CO<sub>2</sub>, Nd-YAG, dye, or excimer types. Other focussed energy devices such as x-ray and electrical discharge electrodes may also be used to create bubbles <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, target bubbles <b>102</b> may be created by sparging gas though nozzles and orifices, and allowing them to rise through the fluid proximate to the working bubble. Radiation produced by laser <b>108</b> is collimated by lens components <b>116</b> and <b>120</b> and focussed distance <b>128</b> by lens <b>124</b>. The intense laser radiation focussed into a small control volume vaporizes the liquid in that volume and creates the cavitation target bubble <b>102</b>. In like manner, laser <b>106</b> and lens components <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>122</b> create the cavitation working bubble <b>104</b> at a distance <b>126</b>. Re-entrant micro-jet <b>140</b> is formed upon the collapse of the working cavitation bubble <b>104</b>, and is attracted through target bubble <b>102</b> to work surface <b>132</b>. By altering the angular orientation of lasers <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, and the focal distances <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>, the re-entrant micro-jet can be positioned to impact anywhere on work surface <b>132</b>. By altering the distance of the working bubble <b>104</b> to the work surface <b>132</b>, the impact force of the jet may also be altered. To be effective in directing the re-entrant micro-jet, the target bubble should be approximately within six (maximum) working bubble diameters of the working bubble. The fluid in tank <b>134</b> can be any fluid that absorbs the laser radiation being utilized, but is preferably water or solutions containing water. The fluid may be re-circulated and filtered by additional pumps and components (not shown) to maintain an appropriate optical clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of a collapsing, working cavitation bubble <b>150</b> in relationship to a target bubble <b>152</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As previously stated, distance <b>156</b> should be approximately less than six maximum working bubble diameters. To attract the re-entrant micro-jet formed as bubble <b>150</b> collapses, target bubble diameter <b>158</b> should be greater than approximately 10% of the maximum working bubble diameter. The projected path of the re-entrant micro-jet is shown by dashed line <b>154</b>. Inwardly directed arrows <b>160</b> in bubble <b>150</b> illustrate the beginning collapse of the outer bubble surface. Concave surface <b>162</b> is indicative of the direction toward which the jet will be launched. Target bubble <b>152</b> may also be a cavitation bubble in an expanding or contracting state, as long as its diameter meets the minimum criteria stated above as working bubble <b>150</b> begins to collapse.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows a target cavitation bubble <b>202</b> formed in close proximity to a working cavitation bubble <b>200</b>. Both bubbles are initiated at approximately the same time, the arrows emanating from the surface pointing outward illustrate an expanding condition for each bubble. The target bubble <b>202</b> is placed between the working bubble <b>200</b> and the work piece <b>204</b>. In this example; the target bubble <b>202</b> is within six working bubble diameters of the working bubble <b>200</b>, and is also within six target bubble diameters of the working bubble <b>200</b>. The working bubble <b>200</b> is greater than six working bubble diameters from the work piece <b>204</b>. As illustrated, the target bubble <b>202</b> is smaller in diameter than the working bubble <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>shows the working bubble <b>206</b> and target bubble <b>208</b> at their maximum expanded diameters, just before they collapse.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>e </i>shows the net effect of the re-entrant micro-jet <b>224</b> launched through the target bubble <b>220</b>, <b>226</b> to the work surface <b>228</b>. Since the working bubble <b>222</b> was initiated as a larger bubble in comparison to the target bubble, the re-entrant micro-jet launched from it (<b>222</b>) is dominant, resulting in a jet directed toward the work surface. However, the impact force imparted by jet <b>224</b> is reduced by the opposing interaction of jet <b>218</b> (launched from the target bubble <b>220</b>, <b>226</b>) on the initial jet <b>216</b>. This phenomena may be utilized to moderate and control the impact force imparted by jet <b>224</b> on the work surface <b>204</b>. The closer bubbles <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are in maximum diameter, the lower the net force delivered to the work piece <b>204</b>.</p>

Jet <b>370</b> is formed by the collapse of cavitation bubble <b>356</b> through target bubble <b>362</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross sectional view <b>400</b> of a cylindrical pore <b>420</b> in which the re-entrant micro-jet <b>408</b> from a working cavitation bubble <b>404</b> directed through a target bubble <b>406</b> are cutting a cavity <b>410</b> in the side wall of the pore <b>402</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

For pore diameters of 5 to 10 microns, re-entrant micro-jets on the order of 10 to 20 nanometers can be created, creating channels in the side walls in the 20 to 30 nanometer range. In silicon substrates, this could allow fabrication of trench capacitor structures of extremely small dimension, utilizing a volume of the substrate not accessible previously. The fabrication technology may enable true three dimensional device fabrication strategies to produce nanometer device geometry's without the use of lithography.</p>

Multiple slots produced in a horizontal fashion could provide a basis for very high surface area capacitors for advanced memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a cross sectional view of a cylindrical pore <b>402</b> in where the re-entrant micro-jets <b>408</b> from a working bubble <b>404</b> directed through a target bubble <b>406</b> are cutting a cavity at an angle not normal to the surface of the pore in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In this case target bubble <b>406</b> is placed in a horizontal plane above or below cavitation bubble <b>404</b>. If the position of bubbles <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> are held constant, the re-entrant micro-jet <b>408</b> will cut a cavity <b>422</b> at an angle to the vertical wall of pore <b>402</b>. By placing target bubble <b>406</b> at fixed depth intervals, cavities at various angles of depth <b>426</b> can be produced. By adjusting the depth of target bubble <b>406</b> in a continues manner, a larger cutout following the outline <b>424</b> may be obtained. By applying the techniques illustrated in the previous <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-14</figref>, practically any profile or shape can be fabricated in the walls of a pore.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic view of a cavitation based process for injecting solution components into liposomes in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Liposomes are microscopic, fluid-filled pouches whose walls are made of layers of phospholipids identical to the phospholipids that make up cell membranes. The fluid inside the pouch may contain soluble drugs designed to be delivered to cells when the liposomes merge with the cell walls of a targeted cell. One way to inject the drug into the interior of a liposome is shown in via the apparatus <b>450</b> in this figure. A container <b>452</b> contains a fluid solution <b>454</b>, a liposome manufacturing module <b>456</b> (which can also reside outside the walls of container <b>452</b>), and a nozzle <b>458</b> for delivering liposomes <b>460</b> to the fluid <b>454</b>. The liposomes may be manufactured with no drugs in their interiors, some amount of the desired drug, or a mixture of completely different drugs. The drugs to be injected are present in the solution <b>454</b>. In one example, a cavitation bubble <b>464</b> is nucleated within five bubble diameters of a liposome <b>460</b><i>b</i>. The liposome acts like a target bubble, attracting the re-entrant micro-jet <b>472</b>. Adjustment of the control volume and initial energy dose will determine the size of the cavitation bubble, and therefore the size of micro-jet <b>472</b>. The collapsing cavitation bubble entrains components of the solution <b>454</b>, including the drugs to be injected, and the micro-jet <b>472</b> delivers these components through the wall of the liposome <b>460</b><i>b</i>. In a second example, a target bubble <b>468</b> is nucleated in the proximity to a working bubble <b>462</b>, in such a manner as to direct a re-entrant micro-jet <b>470</b> into the interior of liposome <b>460</b><i>a</i>. This method allows the working bubble <b>462</b> to be a further distance from liposome <b>460</b><i>a</i>, allowing additional flexibility in reducing dosage levels injected into the liposome, as well as reducing the potentially damaging impact of a jet launched in close proximity.</p>
