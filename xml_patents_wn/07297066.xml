<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a bellows-shaped joint boot made of resin mainly used for a tripod type constant velocity joint, etc. of automobiles.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As one of constant velocity joints used for driveshafts or the like for vehicles, a tripod type of joint is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A tripod type constant velocity joint is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b> by way of example, comprised of a tripod <b>4</b> constructed so that three trunnions <b>3</b> having rollers <b>2</b> are provided to the one shaft <b>1</b> of an input side and an output side shafts in a manner projecting in normal direction to the axis, and an outer housing <b>6</b> provided at an end of the other shaft <b>5</b>. The outer housing <b>6</b> has on its inner periphery three axially extending sliding grooves <b>6</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the tripod <b>4</b>. The constant velocity joint is constructed so that the rollers <b>2</b> of the tripod <b>4</b> are mated with the sliding grooves <b>6</b><i>a </i>to be slidably movable in the axial direction, thereby enabling a running torque to be transmitted while enabling the angulation of both shafts <b>1</b>, <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such constant velocity joint as this, in order to prevent the ingress of dust or foreign substances within the joint or to retain grease contained therein, it is a general practice to mount a joint boot <b>100</b> assuming a bellows shape capable of proper extension and contraction and bending deformation so as to cover the part of the shaft <b>1</b> on the tripod <b>4</b> side from the outer housing <b>6</b>. The axially one end of the joint boot <b>100</b> is formed as a large-diameter attachment part <b>101</b> that is attached and fitted to the outer periphery of the outer housing <b>6</b> and fixed by a clamping member <b>7</b> such as a ring-shaped band or the like, whereas the other end thereof is formed as a small-diameter attachment part <b>102</b> that is fixed to and around the outer periphery of the shaft <b>1</b> on the tripod <b>4</b> side by a clamping member <b>8</b>, e.g. a ring-like band or the like, and both <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are connected integrally through a bellows part <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the outer housing <b>6</b> is provided, on its external periphery, with three recessed portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>equidistantly disposed in the circumferential direction, corresponding to the arrangement of the sliding grooves <b>6</b><i>a </i>on its internal periphery, and accordingly, the external peripheral contour of the outer housing <b>6</b> is configured in a non-circular shape constituting a tongued and grooved form in the circumferential direction. Therefore the large-diameter attachment part <b>101</b> of the joint boot <b>100</b> to be attached to the outer housing <b>6</b> assumes, in its external peripheral configuration, a circular form in cross-section and, in its internal peripheral configuration, a non-circular form conforming to the external peripheral configuration of the outer housing <b>6</b>. That is, on the internal periphery of the large-diameter attachment part <b>101</b> there are provided lobe portions <b>104</b> protruding inwardly in three circumferential places corresponding to the recessed portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the outer housing <b>6</b> (cf. EP Patent Publication 0915264 A2; JP Patent Application Publication 2003-329057 A).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the aforementioned joint boot which has a plurality of the lobe portions on the inner periphery of the large-diameter attachment part, due to the presence of the plural lobe portions, the large-diameter attachment part is difficult to assemble with the outer housing, so that a problem of poor productivity arises. In particular, in the case where in order to enhance the durability the joint boot is fabricated from a resin material, the large-diameter attachment part is high in stiffness and consequently, it is hard to insert the outer housing within the large-diameter attachment part.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the light of the problem described above, this invention has been accomplished, and it is an object of the invention to provide a resin-made joint boot to be attached to an outer housing having a non-circular outer peripheral configuration as in a tripod type constant velocity joint or the like, wherein the resin joint boot is remarkable in assembling properties of its large-diameter attachment part to the outer housing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The resin joint boot, with which this invention is concerned, comprises a cylindrical large-diameter attachment part at one end thereof to be attached to an outer housing whose outer periphery is configured to have a plurality of recessed portions in the circumferential direction, a cylindrical small-diameter attachment part at the other end thereof to be attached to a shaft, and a bellows part connecting integrally both, the large-diameter attachment part assuming on its external peripheral surface a circular form in cross-section and being provided on its internal periphery with a plurality of lobe portions protruding radially inwardly in a distributed manner in the circumferential direction, wherein the large-diameter attachment part is provided, in at least one circumferential place of an opening edge face thereof, integrally with a tongue-like piece in a projecting manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to this construction, because it is possible to assemble the large-diameter attachment part onto the outer housing while grabbing the tongue-like piece provided at the opening edge face of the large-diameter attachment part, it is easy to cover and envelop the large-diameter attachment part around the outer periphery of the outer housing and hence, assembling properties can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present invention, where the tongue-like piece is provided at the lobe portions of the large-diameter attachment part alongside of the external peripheral margin of the opening edge face, upon assembling of the large-diameter attachment part to the outer housing, the tongue-like piece is so readily grabbed that the assembling properties can be more enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the invention, the large-diameter attachment part may be provided, on its inner peripheral face, with a faying inner peripheral portion of a smaller diameter than that of the outer housing so that the large-diameter attachment part can be fayed and externally fitted to the outer housing and simultaneously, the large-diameter attachment part may be provided, at its opening extremity on the inner peripheral face, with a straight hole-like upset inner peripheral portion of a larger diameter than that of the outer housing. By providing the faying inner peripheral portion of a smaller diameter than that of the outer housing in this manner so that the large-diameter attachment part can be fayed and externally fitted with the outer housing, it is possible to enhance the faying capability of the large-diameter attachment part to the outer housing. Further the upset inner peripheral portion provided at the opening extremity of the large-diameter attachment part acts as a guide guiding the outer housing when externally fitting the large-diameter attachment part on the outer housing and consequently, despite the structure of the large-diameter attachment part capable of faying and externally fitting with the outer housing, it is possible to facilitate external fitting of the large-diameter attachment part around the outer housing. Taken overall, the sealing properties at the large-diameter attachment part are remarkable, yet the assembling properties of the large-diameter attachment part to the outer housing are remarkable.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this invention, alternatively, the large-diameter attachment part may be provided on the inner peripheral face with the faying inner peripheral portion of a smaller diameter than that of the outer housing so that it can be fayed and externally fitted to the outer housing and concurrently, the opening extremity of the large-diameter attachment part may be provided on its inner peripheral face with a tapered inner peripheral portion that assumes a tapered hole larger in diameter toward the opening extremity side and has an end of a larger diameter than that of the outer housing. Also in this case, due to the faying inner peripheral portion, the sealing properties at the large-diameter attachment part are remarkable. Further because of the tapered inner peripheral portion provided at the opening extremity of the large-diameter attachment part, the outer housing is easy to insert into the interior of the large-diameter attachment part, and consequently, the sealing properties at the large-diameter attachment part are remarkable, yet the assembling properties of the large-diameter attachment part to the outer housing are remarkable.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, the tapered inner peripheral portion may be preset so that its axial dimension and radial dimension at the lobe portions are larger than its axial dimension and radial dimension at arc-like wall portions located between circumferentially adjacent lobe portions. Thereby when the large-diameter attachment part is assembled onto the outer housing, the arc-like wall portions, which are thin-walled and comparatively pliable, are firstly externally fitted to the outer housing, subsequently to which the lobe portions are externally fitted thereto, so that the force required at the initial stage of insertion can be diminished and a smooth insertion is feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to this invention thus constituted above, in the resin joint boot to be attached to an outer housing assuming a non-circular outer contour as in a tripod type constant velocity joint, it is possible to improve on assembling properties of the large-diameter attachment part to the outer housing.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> show a resin joint boot <b>10</b> relating to a first embodiment, which boot is to be installed on an automotive tripod type of constant velocity joint as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The joint boot <b>10</b> is a boot made of thermoplastic elastomer resin, which comprises a large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> at one end thereof, a small-diameter attachment part <b>14</b> at the other end thereof disposed concentrically in a spaced relation from the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, and a hollow bellows part <b>16</b> integrally connecting the large-diameter attachment parts <b>12</b> and the small-diameter attachment part <b>14</b> together, and integrally fabricated by a well-known molding method such as injection blow molding.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> assumes a short cylinder form to be externally fitted and secured to an outer housing <b>6</b> and is provided on its external peripheral face with a circumferentially extending recessed portion <b>18</b> for fixation for receiving thereon a ring-form clamping member <b>7</b>. The small-diameter attachment part <b>14</b> assumes a short cylinder form to be externally fitted and secured to a shaft <b>1</b> on the tripod <b>4</b> side and is provided on its external peripheral surface with a circumferentially extending recessed portion <b>20</b> for fixation for receiving thereon a ring-like clamping member <b>8</b>. The bellows part <b>16</b> is of a bellows body of a circular shape in cross-section having an aperture diameter difference at both ends and defines internally a grease filling space. The bellows part <b>16</b> is configured in a taper shape tapering progressively from the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> down to the small-diameter attachment part <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> assumes, on its external peripheral face, a circular shape in cross-section. On the other hand, its internal periphery assumes a non-circular shape jutting inwardly in the form of a curved plane in a plurality of places (three places in this embodiment) in the circumferential direction so as to accommodate to the external peripheral configuration of the outer housing <b>6</b>, in which a plurality of (three in this embodiment) recessed portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>are disposed equidistantly in the circumferential direction. Thereby the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> includes arc-like wall portions <b>22</b> to be disposed on the arc-like external peripheral faces of the outer housing <b>6</b> and lobe portions <b>24</b> to be mated with the recessed portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the outer housing <b>6</b>, wherein the arc-like wall portions <b>22</b> and the lobe portions <b>24</b> are alternated in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lobe portions <b>24</b> are each made up of, in this embodiment, an inner wall portion <b>26</b> jutting radially inwardly in a curved form and mating with the recessed portion <b>6</b><i>b</i>, an arc-like outer wall portion <b>28</b> constituting part of the external peripheral face of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, a central strut wall <b>30</b> linking the inner wall portion <b>26</b> and the outer wall portion <b>28</b> at circumferentially centers of the both, and a pair of lateral strut walls <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> linking both wall portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> on laterally both sides of the central strut wall <b>30</b>. Thereby at each of the lobe portions <b>24</b>, four relief holes <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>34</b> subsiding axially from an opening edge face <b>12</b>A of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> are thus defined to be juxtaposed in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The central strut wall <b>30</b> is a radially extending wall portion for supporting the inner wall portion <b>26</b> relative to the outer wall portion <b>28</b>, and provided at a circumferentially center of the inner wall portion <b>26</b> most inwardly protruding. The each lateral strut wall <b>32</b> serves to support the inner wall portion <b>26</b> relative to the outer wall portion <b>28</b> and is formed to slant in a manner approaching the central strut wall <b>30</b> as it extends outwardly, not in parallel with the central strut wall <b>30</b>. Due to this slanting, the lateral strut walls <b>32</b> are connected substantially vertically to the inner wall portion <b>26</b> and consequently, when the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> is clamped and anchored, a contact pressure the inner wall portions <b>26</b> exert on the outer housing <b>6</b> can be equalized in the circumferential direction and sealing properties can be enhanced. Further due to the slanting, the cross-sectional area of the relief holes <b>34</b> outside the lateral strut walls <b>32</b> can be ensured thereby to ensure demolding properties of cores upon molding.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">“At the opening edge face <b>12</b>A of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, namely at the edge face of the extremity opposite to the bellows part <b>16</b>, one or more tongue-like piece <b>40</b> is integrally provided in a manner projecting axially outwardly of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>. In this embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, one or more tongue-like piece <b>40</b> is disposed alongside of the external peripheral margin of the opening edge face <b>12</b>A in respective circumferential places corresponding to the three lobe portions <b>24</b>. More specifically, one or more tongue-like piece <b>40</b> is each extended out from the edge face of the outer wall portion <b>28</b> of the lobe portion <b>24</b> in parallel with the axial direction. The shape of one or more tongue-like piece <b>40</b> may be either a trapezoid having a smaller height H than a bottom side length L as in <b>40</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> or a trapezoid having a larger height H than the bottom side length L as in <b>40</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, or a triangle as in <b>40</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, and for that matter, may be a rectangle although not shown, and any other various shapes may be adopted.”</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, at the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, a faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b> of a smaller diameter than that of the outer housing <b>6</b> is provided over a full circumference of the inner peripheral surface. That is, the faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b> is set so that the profile of the inner peripheral face thereof may be smaller than the profile of the outer peripheral face of the outer housing <b>6</b>. More specifically, at the inner periphery of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, the lobe portions <b>24</b> capable of mating with the recessed portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the outer housing <b>6</b> are disposed in a distributed manner as stated above, and consequently, the diameter of the inner periphery varies in the circumferential direction. Therefore diameters at the inner peripheral face of the faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b> are set to be smaller than diameters at corresponding places to the outer housing <b>6</b> in the full circumferential direction. For example, the diameter D<b>2</b> at the lobe portions <b>24</b> is set to be smaller than the diameter D<b>0</b> of the outer housing <b>6</b> at the recessed portions <b>6</b><i>b</i>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> is constructed to be capable of faying and externally fitting with the outer housing <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand, at the opening extremity <b>12</b>B of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, such an upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b> in the form of a straight hole having a larger diameter than that of the outer housing <b>6</b> is provided over a full circumference of the inner peripheral face thereof that serves to guide the outer housing <b>6</b> when externally fitting the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> on the outer housing <b>6</b>. The upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b> is set so that the profile of its inner peripheral face is larger than the profile of the outer peripheral face of the outer housing <b>6</b>, namely the diameters at the inner peripheral surface of the upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b> are larger, over its full circumference, than diameters at corresponding places of the outer housing <b>6</b>. For instance, the diameter D<b>1</b> at the lobe portions <b>24</b> is set larger than the diameter D<b>0</b> at the recessed portions <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the outer housing <b>6</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a boundary between the faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b> and the upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b> forms a tapered inner peripheral portion <b>46</b> assuming a tapered hole that is larger in diameter toward the opening edge face <b>12</b>A, whereby it is made easier to insert the outer housing <b>6</b> into the faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b>. A boundary <b>48</b> between the upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b> and the opening edge face <b>12</b>A assumes also a tapered hole, making it easier to introduce the outer housing <b>6</b> into the upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, the reference numeral <b>50</b> designates a protruding streak for sealing provided on the inner peripheral surface of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, and in this example, two ones are provided. The reference numeral <b>52</b> designates a positioning protrusion extending in the circumferential direction provided on the inner peripheral surface at each of the arc-like wall portions <b>22</b> of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>. The positioning protrusion <b>52</b> is mated with a groove <b>54</b> provided on the outer peripheral surface of the outer housing <b>6</b>, whereby positioning of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> in the axial direction is made.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the resin joint boot <b>10</b> thus constructed above will be assembled with a constant velocity joint, the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> is externally fitted onto the outer housing <b>6</b> and fixed thereto by fastening the clamping member <b>7</b> to the recessed portion <b>18</b> for fixation on the outer periphery of the outer housing while the small-diameter attachment part <b>14</b> is externally fitted to the shaft <b>1</b> and secured thereto by fastening the clamping member <b>8</b> to the recessed portion <b>20</b> for fixation on the outer periphery thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In externally fitting the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> to the outer housing <b>6</b>, because the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> are provided on the opening edge face <b>12</b>A side of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, by holding (grabbing) the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> to pull them (accordingly, together with the large-diameter attachment part), it is possible to assemble the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> with the outer housing <b>6</b>. Therefore, it is easy to cover the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> over the outer periphery of the outer housing <b>6</b> and consequently, it is possible to enhance the assembling properties. In particular, in this embodiment, since the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> are disposed alongside of the outer wall portions <b>28</b> of the lobe portions <b>24</b>, the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> are situated in a spaced relation to the outer peripheral face of the outer housing <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, so that the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> are easy to grab, whereby the assembling properties can be more enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further in externally fitting the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> to the outer housing <b>6</b>, the upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b> provided on the opening extremity <b>12</b>B of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> serves to guide the outer housing <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, so that it is easy to externally fit the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> on the outer housing <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">And once that the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> is externally fitted, due to the faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b>, the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> is mated in a faying state with the outer housing <b>6</b>. Therefore the assembling properties of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> to the outer housing <b>6</b> are excellent, and yet the sealing properties at the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b> are excellent, too.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now the resin joint boot pertaining to a second embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B. In the second embodiment, the arrangement of the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> is different from that in the first embodiment. That is, in the second embodiment, the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> are not disposed at the lobe portions <b>24</b>, but at three arc-like wall portions <b>22</b> in their corresponding circumferential parts, namely they are formed to project axially outwardly from the opening edge face <b>12</b>A at the arc-like wall portions <b>22</b> of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>. In this case, in order to make it easy to manipulate the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> on the outer housing <b>6</b>, the tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> are provided at their tip ends each with a projecting lug <b>56</b> that projects radially outwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. The tongue-like pieces <b>40</b> may be provided in any position in a variety of circumferential positions on the opening edge face <b>12</b>A of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>, not solely in the circumferential positions corresponding to the lobe portions <b>24</b>. Further the number of the tongue-like piece <b>40</b> to form is not limited to three as in these embodiments, but, for example, may be only one.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">“The second embodiment is further different from the first embodiment in the following respect. That is, in the second embodiment, the upset inner peripheral portion <b>44</b> described above is not provided, but a tapered inner peripheral portion <b>58</b> assuming a tapered hole larger in diameter toward the opening edge face <b>12</b>A′ is formed on the opening extremity <b>12</b>B′ of the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>′ over a full circumference of the inner peripheral face thereof so as to extend up to the opening edge face <b>12</b>A′. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the tapered inner peripheral portion <b>58</b> has an edge (end) <b>58</b>A larger in diameter than that of the outer housing <b>6</b>, namely the diameter D<b>3</b> at the edge <b>58</b>A of the tapered inner peripheral portion <b>58</b> is set to be larger than the diameter D<b>0</b> at a corresponding place of the outer housing <b>6</b>.”</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">“The tapered inner peripheral portion <b>58</b> is set so that an axial dimension X<b>1</b> and a radial dimension Y<b>1</b> in circumferential portions corresponding to the lobe portions <b>24</b>′ are respectively larger than an axial dimension X<b>2</b> and a radial dimension Y<b>2</b> in circumferential portions corresponding to the arc-like wall portions <b>22</b> (X<b>1</b>&gt;X<b>2</b>, Y<b>1</b>&gt;Y<b>2</b>). More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the radial dimension Y<b>1</b> of the tapered inner peripheral portion <b>58</b> is set to be larger than the thickness of the inner wall portion <b>26</b>′ in a circumferentially central part of the lobe portion <b>24</b>′ and approximately a half a radial dimension Z of the lobe portions <b>24</b>′. Further the radial dimension Z of the lobe portions <b>24</b>′ varies in the circumferential direction, according to which as the radial dimension Z of the lobe portions <b>24</b>′ is smaller, the aforesaid dimensions X<b>1</b> and Y<b>1</b> of the tapered inner peripheral portion <b>58</b> are also set to be smaller proportionally.”</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">“By setting the tapered inner peripheral portion <b>58</b> to be larger at the lobe portions <b>24</b>′ in this manner, when assembling the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>′ with the outer housing <b>6</b>, the arc-like wall portions <b>22</b> which are thin-walled and relatively pliable are firstly put into abutment on the edge face of the outer housing <b>6</b> to be externally fitted thereto, and thereafter the lobe portions <b>24</b>′ are put into abutment on the edge face of the outer housing <b>6</b> to be externally fitted. Because of that, it is possible to reduce a force required at the beginning of the insertion, and a smooth insertion is thus possible.”</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">“As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>A, and <b>8</b>B at the large-diameter attachment part <b>12</b>′, a faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b>′ of a smaller diameter than that of the outer housing <b>6</b> is provided over a full circumference of the inner peripheral surface. That is, the faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b>′ is set so that the profile of the inner peripheral face thereof may be smaller than the profile of the outer peripheral face of the outer housing <b>6</b>. Therefore diameters at the inner peripheral face of the faying inner peripheral portion <b>42</b>′ are set to be smaller than diameters at corresponding places to the outer housing <b>6</b> in the full circumferential direction. In the second embodiment, since the other construction and effects achieved are similar to those of the first embodiment, like parts to the first embodiment are designated by like reference characters, but including the affixation of a prime, so that description of them will be omitted.”</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The resin-made joint boot of this invention is excellent in assembling properties of the large-diameter attachment part to the outer housing, and consequently, can be utilized advantageously as a joint boot used mainly for automotive tripod type of constant velocity joints.</p>
