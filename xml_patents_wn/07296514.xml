<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a convex/concave pattern-forming stamp that has convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions formed in a predetermined annular area of a surface thereof, for forming a convex/concave pattern in a resin layer on a substrate surface by being pressed against the resin layer, a method of forming the convex/concave pattern using the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp, and a magnetic recording medium that has data-recording tracks formed thereon using the convex/concave pattern formed according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a process of manufacturing semi-conductor elements or recording media, for example, to form a fine (nanometer-sized) convex/concave pattern in a resin layer on a substrate surface, there has been proposed an imprinting method in which nanometer-sized protrusions/recesses (protrusions) formed on a stamp (mold) are pressed against a resin layer on a substrate surface to thereby transfer convex/concave shapes of the protrusions/recesses to the resin layer (Stephen Y. Chou et al., “Imprint of sub-25 nm Vias and Trenches in Polymers”, Applied Physics Letters (US), vol. 67, No. 21, Nov. 20, 1995, pp. 3114-3116).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this imprinting method, first, a stamp is prepared which has a surface thereof formed with protrusions/recesses that are nanometer-sized (with a width of 25 nm at the minimum). In this case, the protrusions/recesses of the stamp are formed by drawing a pattern on a silicon substrate having a silicon dioxide layer formed on a surface thereof, using an electron beam lithography device, and then carrying out an etching process using a reactive ion etching (RIE) device. Then, PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) as a resin material is applied to the silicon substrate surface by a spin coating method to form a resin layer having a thickness of 55 nm. Subsequently, the stamp, the substrate, and the resin layer are heated such that the temperatures of the stamp, the substrate, and the resin layer become equal to a temperature (e.g. 200° C.) not lower than 105° C. which is the glass transition point of PMMA, whereafter the protrusions/recesses of the stamp are pressed against the resin layer with a pressure of 13.1 MPa (1900 psi). After allowing the stamp, the substrate, and the resin layer to be cooled down to room temperature, the stamp is separated from the resin layer. Thus, the convex/concave shapes of the protrusions/recesses of the stamp are transferred to the resin layer, whereby a nanometer-sized convex/concave pattern is formed in the resin layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, there has been proposed a discrete track-type magnetic recording medium (hereinafter also simply referred to as “the magnetic recording medium”) <b>91</b> having a plurality of data-recording discrete tracks (hereinafter simply referred to as “the discrete tracks”) <b>92</b>, <b>92</b>, . . . formed in a track-forming area <b>102</b> on a surface of a disk-shaped substrate <b>101</b> (magnetic layer <b>112</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. In the magnetic recording medium <b>91</b>, the discrete tracks <b>92</b> are magnetically separated from each other by a plurality of concentric annular grooves formed in a resin layer of the disk-shape substrate <b>101</b> such that they have a convex/concave pattern, according to the imprinting method described above. The convex/concave pattern used for forming the discrete tracks <b>92</b> of the magnetic recording medium <b>91</b> is formed using a stamp <b>41</b> having nanometer-sized protrusions <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>, . . . formed in an annular area <b>43</b> on a surface thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. The annular area <b>43</b> is defined, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, to have the same size as the track-forming area <b>102</b> of the disk-shaped substrate <b>101</b>. In forming the convex/concave pattern using the stamp <b>41</b>, according to the imprinting method described above, after forming a resin layer <b>103</b> on the surface of the disk-shaped substrate <b>101</b> comprised of, for example, a disk <b>111</b> made of glass, the magnetic layer <b>112</b>, and a metal layer <b>113</b>, the protrusions <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>, . . . of the stamp <b>41</b> are pressed against the resin layer <b>103</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, the convex/concave pattern is formed in a convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>104</b> of the resin layer <b>103</b> corresponding to the annular area <b>43</b> of the stamp <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors have studied the above-descried conventional stamp <b>41</b>, and found the following problems: As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the stamp <b>41</b> has the protrusions <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>, . . . formed only in the annular area <b>43</b> which is defined to have the same size as the track-forming area <b>102</b>. The stamp <b>41</b> also has an outer area <b>44</b> and an inner area <b>45</b> located radially outward and inward of the annular area <b>43</b>, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>, and neither of the two areas <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> is formed with any protrusions <b>51</b>, which bring about the following inconveniences: since no protrusions are formed in the outer and inner areas <b>44</b> and <b>45</b>, when the stamp <b>41</b> is pressed against the resin layer <b>103</b>, there occurs concentration of pressure on an outer peripheral portion <b>104</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>104</b> and an inner peripheral portion <b>104</b><i>c </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) of the same. For this reason, the depth of recesses (height of protrusions) formed in the outer and inner peripheral portions <b>104</b><i>b </i>and <b>104</b><i>c </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>104</b> becomes larger than the depth of recesses (larger than the height of protrusions) formed in a central portion <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>104</b>, which makes the recesses non-uniform in depth. Further, since the pressure is concentrated on the outer and inner peripheral portions <b>104</b><i>b </i>and <b>104</b><i>c </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>104</b>, the convex/concave pattern is deformed in the outer and inner peripheral portions <b>104</b><i>b </i>and <b>104</b><i>c</i>. Moreover, there arises the problem that portions (resin material) of the convex/concave pattern in the outer and inner peripheral portions <b>104</b><i>b </i>and <b>104</b><i>c </i>adhered to the corresponding protrusions <b>51</b> of the stamp <b>41</b> are peeled off the substrate when the stamp <b>41</b> is separated from the resin layer <b>103</b>. Therefore, the magnetic recording media <b>91</b> manufactured using the convex/concave pattern are formed with the discrete tracks <b>92</b> non-uniform in height (i.e. depth of the grooves separating the discrete tracks <b>92</b>), and/or suffer from deformed or lost discrete tracks <b>92</b> in the outer and inner peripheral portions of the track-forming area <b>102</b>, which can cause a recording error in data recording.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made to solve the problems described above, and a first object thereof is to provide a convex/concave pattern-forming stamp and a convex/concave pattern-forming method, which are capable of making the recesses of a convex/concave pattern uniform in depth and preventing deformation and peeling of the convex/concave pattern at the same time. Further, it is a second object of the present invention to provide a magnetic recording medium which is capable of preventing occurrence of recording error.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To attain the above first object, in a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a convex/concave pattern-forming stamp having, on a surface thereof, a predetermined annular area formed with convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions for forming a convex/concave pattern in a resin layer on a surface of a substrate by being pressed against the resin layer, wherein pressure-dispersing protrusions for dispersing pressure applied to the resin layer when the convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions are pressed against the resin layer are formed in at least one of an outer area located radially outward of the annular area and an inner area located radially inward of the annular area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To attain the above first object, in a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of forming a convex/concave pattern, comprising the steps of forming a resin layer on a surface of a substrate, and pressing against the resin layer a convex/concave pattern-forming stamp that has convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions formed in a predetermined annular area on a surface thereof, and pressure-dispersing protrusions formed in at least one of an outer area located radially outward of the annular area and an inner area located radially inward of the annular area, to thereby form a convex/concave pattern in the resin layer by the convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With the arrangement of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp according to the first aspect of the present invention and the arrangement of the convex/concave pattern-forming method according to the second aspect of the present invention, the pressure-dispersing protrusions are formed in at least one of the outer area located radially outward of the annular area and the inner area located radially inward of the annular area. Therefore, pressure applied to the resin layer via the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp when the stamp is pressed against the resin layer can be dispersed to a part of the resin layer corresponding to the annular area of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp, and a part of the resin layer corresponding to the outer area (or the inner area) of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp, so that substantially uniform pressure can be applied to the entire area of the resin layer to be formed with the convex/concave pattern. As a result, the recesses substantially uniform in depth (and protrusions substantially uniform in height) can be formed in the area to be formed with the convex/concave pattern. Further, since concentration of pressure on the outer and inner peripheral portions of the area to be formed with the convex/concave pattern can be prevented, deformation of the convex/concave pattern in these portions of the resin layer and peeling of the pattern which could occur when the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp is separated from the resin layer can be positively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the pressure-dispersing protrusions are formed in both of the outer area and the inner area. With this arrangement of the preferred embodiment, the pressure applied to the resin layer when the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp is pressed against the resin layer can be dispersed to both of the respective parts of the resin layer corresponding to the outer area and the inner area of the stamp. Therefore, it is possible to more uniformly apply pressure to the entirety of the area to be formed with the convex/concave pattern than when pressure-dispersing protrusions are additionally formed in only one of the outer area and the inner area. This makes it possible to make the recesses more uniform in depth.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the pressure-dispersing protrusions are formed such that the pressure-dispersing protrusions each have the same or substantially the same shape as each of the convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions. With this arrangement of the preferred embodiment, the convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions and the pressure-dispersing protrusions can be formed by continuous processing under the same processing conditions in manufacturing the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp. This makes it possible to shorten the processing time, thereby reducing manufacturing costs of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the pressure-dispersing protrusions are formed at a location spaced from the annular area by a predetermined radial distance. With this arrangement of the preferred embodiment, the area for forming the pressure-dispersing protrusions can be reduced, so that the processing area of the stamp can also be reduced by the reduced part of the area for forming the pressure-dispersing protrusions in manufacturing the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp. This makes it possible to reduce processing costs of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To attain the above second object, in a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magnetic recording medium formed with data-recording tracks, wherein the data-recording tracks are formed using a convex/concave pattern formed in a resin layer on a surface of a substrate by convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions by pressing against the resin layer a convex/concave pattern-forming stamp that has the convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions formed in a predetermined annular area on a surface thereof, and pressure-dispersing protrusions formed in at least one of an outer area located radially outward of the annular area and an inner area located radially inward of the annular area.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To attain the above second object, in a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a magnetic recording medium comprising data-recording tracks formed in an annular area on a surface thereof, the annular area having a predetermined width, and non-data-recording pattern formed in at least one of an outer area located radially outward of the annular area and an inner area located radially inward of the annular area.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With the respective arrangements of the magnetic recording media according to the third and fourth aspects of the present invention, the data-recording tracks and the non-data-recording pattern are formed e.g. using the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp according to the first aspect of the invention described above. Therefore, in the magnetic recording media, a convex/concave pattern is formed in the resin layer in a state where pressure applied to the resin layer via the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp when the stamp is pressed against the resin layer is dispersed to a part of the resin layer corresponding to the annular area of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp, and a part of the resin layer corresponding to the outer area (or the inner area) of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp, i.e. in a state where substantially uniform pressure is applied to the entire area of the resin layer to be formed with the convex/concave pattern. Therefore, according to the magnetic recording media, the data-recording tracks are formed, without being deformed or peeled, what is more with substantially uniform height (with substantially uniform depth of grooves separating the tracks), which makes it possible to positively prevent occurrence of a recording error.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The best modes of the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp, the convex/concave pattern-forming method, and the magnetic recording medium according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings showing preferred embodiments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">First of all, the configurations of a coating device <b>1</b> and a transfer device <b>2</b> will be described with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the coating device <b>1</b> is used in applying a resin material onto a surface of a disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method of the present invention, to thereby form a resin layer <b>63</b> thereon (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and is comprised of a motor <b>11</b>, a turntable <b>12</b>, a discharge mechanism <b>13</b>, and a control section <b>14</b>. The motor <b>11</b> rotates the turntable <b>12</b> in response to a control signal from the control section <b>14</b>. The turntable <b>12</b> is formed such that the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> can be placed thereon, and is rotated by the motor <b>11</b>. The discharge mechanism <b>13</b> discharges the resin material (e.g. a polystyrene-based copolymer) onto an inner peripheral portion (portion slightly radially outward of a hole formed in the center) of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> placed on the turntable <b>12</b>, in response to a control signal from the control section <b>14</b>. The control section <b>14</b> controls rotation of the motor <b>11</b> and discharge of the resin material by the discharge mechanism <b>13</b> such that the resin layer <b>63</b> is formed to have a predetermined thickness (e.g. 65 nm (nanometers)). The disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> is for a magnetic recording medium <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> is e.g. comprised of a glass disk <b>71</b>, and a magnetic layer <b>72</b> and a metal layer <b>73</b> formed on the surface of the glass disk <b>71</b> in advance. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a plurality of concentric discrete tracks (corresponding to data-recording tracks in the present invention) <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>, . . . separated from each other at a predetermined pitch (e.g. 150 nm) are formed in a track-forming area <b>62</b> of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> (magnetic layer <b>72</b>), whereby the magnetic recording medium <b>3</b> is produced. It should be noted that an orientation layer, a soft magnetic layer, and a base layer are actually formed between the disk <b>71</b> and the magnetic layer <b>72</b>, but illustration and description thereof are omitted for ease of understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transfer device <b>2</b> is for forming an convex/concave pattern in the resin layer <b>63</b> formed on the surface of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transfer device <b>2</b> is comprised of a heating stage <b>21</b>, a press mechanism <b>22</b>, a control section <b>23</b>, and a stamp <b>24</b>. The heating stage <b>21</b> is formed such that the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> can be placed thereon, and heats the resin layer <b>63</b> and the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> in response to a control signal from the control section <b>23</b>. The press mechanism <b>22</b> to which the stamp <b>24</b> can be fixedly attached presses the stamp <b>24</b> (downward) against the heating stage <b>21</b> in response to a control signal from the control section <b>23</b>. In the present embodiment, the press mechanism <b>22</b> has a heating capability of heating the stamp <b>24</b> fixed thereto. The control section <b>23</b> controls heating operation by the heating stage <b>21</b>, and heating operation and pressing operation by the press mechanism <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The stamp <b>24</b> corresponds to the convex/concave pattern-forming stamp according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the stamp <b>24</b> is formed e.g. of silicon carbide such that it is generally disk-shaped. The outer diameter L<b>1</b> of the stamp <b>24</b> is defined to be slightly larger than that of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>, i.e. equal to e.g. 22.0 mm. Further, the stamp <b>24</b> has a central portion thereof formed with a central hole <b>29</b> (through which is inserted a clamping jig for clamping the stamp <b>24</b> on the press mechanism <b>22</b>) having a diameter L<b>2</b> of e.g. 6.0 mm. On the surface of the stamp <b>24</b>, there are defined an annular area <b>26</b>, an outer area <b>27</b>, and an inner area <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the annular area <b>26</b>, there are formed protrusions <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>, . . . for forming the convex/concave pattern in the resin layer <b>63</b>. The protrusions <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>, . . . corresponding to convex/concave pattern-forming protrusions in the present invention are concentrically formed around the center of the stamp <b>24</b> at a predetermined pitch (e.g. 150 nm). Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the annular area <b>26</b> is defined to have approximately the same size as the track-forming area <b>62</b> of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>. More specifically, the annular area <b>26</b> is defined, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as an area having an inner diameter L<b>3</b> of e.g. 8.0 mm and an outer diameter L<b>4</b> of e.g. 18.0 mm. It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the areas <b>26</b> to <b>28</b> are illustrated in a different proportion therebetween from an actual one for ease of understanding of the present invention. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the protrusions <b>31</b> and protrusions <b>32</b>, referred to hereinafter, are each illustrated in an exaggerated manner, i.e. with a larger size than the actual size.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the outer area <b>27</b> is located radially outward of the annular area <b>26</b> on the surface of the stamp <b>24</b>, and defined as an annular area having a width L<b>5</b> of e.g. 2.0 mm. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the outer area <b>27</b>, a plurality of protrusions (corresponding to pressure-dispersing protrusions in the present invention) <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>, . . . each identical in shape to the protrusion <b>31</b> are concentrically formed at the same pitch as that of the protrusions <b>31</b>. The inner area <b>28</b> is located radially inward of the annular area <b>26</b> on the surface of the stamp <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and defined as an annular area having a width L<b>6</b> of e.g. 1.0 mm. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, also in the inner area <b>28</b>, a plurality of the protrusions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>, . . . (only one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are concentrically formed at the same pitch as that of the protrusions <b>31</b>. The protrusions <b>32</b> formed in the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b> have the function of dispersing pressure applied to the resin layer <b>63</b> via the stamp <b>24</b> when the stamp <b>24</b> is pressed against the resin layer <b>63</b> by the press mechanism <b>22</b>, as described hereinafter, between a convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), an outer peripheral part <b>65</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), and an inner peripheral part <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the resin layer <b>63</b>, corresponding, respectively, to the annular area <b>26</b>, the outer area <b>27</b>, and the inner area <b>28</b> of the stamp <b>24</b>, to thereby make substantially uniform the pressure applied to the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The stamp <b>24</b> is produced e.g. by a dry etching method using a mask. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a resin material is applied onto a surface of a disk-shaped substrate <b>25</b> made of silicon carbide, whereby a resin layer <b>25</b><i>a </i>is formed on the substrate <b>25</b>. Then, a pattern obtained by inverting the pattern of the protrusions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> is drawn on the resin layer <b>25</b><i>a </i>e.g. using an electron beam lithography device. Subsequently, the resin layer <b>25</b><i>a </i>is subjected to a development process. As a result, the convex/concave pattern inverted from the pattern of the protrusions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> is formed in the resin layer <b>25</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a nickel layer <b>25</b><i>b </i>is formed on the respective bottoms of recesses of the convex/concave pattern (i.e. the surface of the substrate <b>25</b>) and on the top surfaces of the protrusions of the same by vapor deposition. Thereafter, portions of the nickel layer <b>25</b><i>b </i>formed on the top surfaces of the protrusions are removed together with resin material by a lift-off process. As a result, portions of the nickel layer <b>25</b><i>b </i>formed on the respective bottoms of the recesses form a nickel pattern on the surface of the substrate <b>25</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Then, a dry etching process is carried out using the nickel pattern as a mask. Thus, portions where the nickel pattern is not formed are removed as indicated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, whereby the stamp <b>24</b> formed with the protrusions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> is completed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, a process for forming the convex/concave pattern according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">First, the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> is placed on the turntable <b>12</b>, and operation of the coating device <b>1</b> is started. As the coating device <b>1</b> is started, the control section <b>14</b> delivers the control signals to the motor <b>11</b> and the discharge mechanism <b>13</b>, respectively. In this case, the motor <b>11</b> causes the turntable <b>12</b> to be rotated e.g. only five turns at a low speed in response to the control signals, and the discharge mechanism <b>13</b> discharges the resin material (polystyrene-based copolymer in the present embodiment) in a predetermined amount (amount required for forming the resin layer <b>63</b> such that the resin layer <b>63</b> has a thickness of 65 nm) onto the central portion of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>. Then, the control section <b>14</b> delivers to the motor <b>11</b> control signals for rotating the turntable <b>12</b> at a high speed over a predetermined time period. In response to the control signals, the motor <b>11</b> rotates the turntable <b>12</b> at the high speed. In accordance with the rotation of the turntable <b>12</b>, the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> is rotated at the high speed, and centrifugal force generated by the high-speed rotation of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> causes the discharged resin material to spread with a uniform thickness toward the outer periphery of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>. As a result, the resin layer <b>63</b> with the thickness of 65 nm is formed on the surface of the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> (metal layer <b>73</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, the stamp <b>24</b> is mounted on the press mechanism <b>22</b>. Then, the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> formed thereon with the resin layer <b>63</b> is placed on the heating stage <b>21</b>, and the transfer device <b>2</b> is caused to start processing. With the start of the processing by the transfer device <b>2</b>, the control section <b>23</b> delivers to the heating stage <b>21</b> and the press mechanism <b>22</b> control signals for instructing the heating stage <b>21</b> and the press mechanism <b>22</b> to start heating. In response to the signals, the heating stage <b>21</b> heats the resin layer <b>63</b> and the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>, and the press mechanism <b>22</b> heats the stamp <b>24</b>. Then, the control section <b>23</b> monitors e.g. output signals from temperature sensors (not shown) to thereby check the respective temperatures of the resin layer <b>63</b>, the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>, and the stamp <b>24</b>. When the temperatures have reached a temperature (e.g. 170° C.) which is equal to or higher than the glass transition point of the resin material, the control section <b>23</b> delivers to the press mechanism <b>22</b> a control signal for instructing the same to press the stamp <b>24</b>. In response to the control signal, the press mechanism <b>22</b> presses the stamp <b>24</b> with a pressure of e.g. 80 kgf/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this operation, the protrusions <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>, . . . and <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>, . . . of the stamp <b>24</b> are pressed against the resin layer <b>63</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, to thereby deform the resin material forming the resin layer <b>63</b>. In this case, since the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b> have the protrusions <b>32</b> formed thereon as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the pressure applied by the press mechanism <b>22</b> is dispersed between the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>, the outer peripheral part <b>65</b>, and the inner peripheral part <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the resin layer <b>63</b>. This causes substantially uniform pressure to be applied to the entire convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>. Subsequently, the control section <b>23</b> delivers to the press mechanism <b>22</b> a control signal for instructing the same to stop the pressing operation, and at the same time delivers to the heating stage <b>21</b> and the press mechanism <b>22</b> control signals for instructing them to stop the heating operation. In response to the control signals, the heating stage <b>21</b> stops the heating operation, and the press mechanism <b>22</b> stops the pressing operation and the heating operation. Thereafter, the resin layer <b>63</b>, the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>, and the stamp <b>24</b> are left standing to allow the temperatures thereof to lower to e.g. 35° C. In this case, a method may be employed which uses a cooling mechanism to forcibly lower the temperatures. Then, the stamp <b>24</b> is separated from the resin layer <b>63</b>. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a convex/concave pattern is formed in the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b> of the resin layer <b>63</b> by transfer of the shape of each protrusion <b>31</b> thereto, and convex/concave patterns are also formed in the outer peripheral part <b>65</b> and the inner peripheral part <b>66</b> of the resin layer <b>63</b> by transfer of the shape of each protrusion <b>32</b> thereto. In this case, since the substantially uniform pressure is applied to the entire convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b> during the pressing operation, recesses substantially uniform in depth (and protrusions substantially uniform in height) are formed in the area <b>64</b>. Further, since pressure is not concentrated on an outer peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>b </i>and an inner peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>c </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>, it is possible to positively prevent deformation of the convex/concave pattern in the outer peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>b </i>and the inner peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>c </i>and peeling of the convex/concave pattern during separation of the stamp <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Convex/concave patterns formed using the stamp <b>24</b> according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method were observed by a scanning electron microscope. Further, a convex/concave pattern formed using a stamp (conventional stamp <b>41</b>) having no protrusions formed in its outer and inner peripheral areas, under the same conditions as employed in the case of the stamp <b>24</b>, was observed by the scanning electron microscope. As a result, it was found that in the case of the convex/concave patterns formed using the stamp <b>24</b>, recesses substantially uniform in depth (protrusions substantially uniform in height) were formed in the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>. Further, no deformation or peeling of the convex/concave pattern was observed in the outer peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>b </i>or the inner peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>c </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>. On the other hand, in the case of the convex/concave pattern formed using the conventional stamp <b>41</b>, the outer and inner peripheral portions of a convex/concave pattern-forming area were formed with recesses with larger depths than those of recesses in the central part of the convex/concave pattern-forming area. Further, deformation and peeling of the convex/concave pattern were observed in the outer and inner peripheral portions of the convex/concave pattern-forming area. It is obvious from these results that the use of the stamp <b>24</b> having the outer and inner peripheral areas <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> thereof formed with the protrusions <b>32</b> makes it possible to form a convex/concave pattern having recesses (protrusions) substantially uniform in depth (height).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, a description will be given of the step of manufacturing the magnetic recording medium <b>3</b> by forming the discrete tracks <b>4</b> on the disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b> (magnetic layer <b>72</b>) using the convex/concave pattern formed in the resin layer <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">First, resin material remaining in the recesses in the convex/concave pattern in the resin layer <b>63</b> is removed by oxygen plasma treatment. Then, an etching process using a gas for metal etching is performed using the convex/concave pattern (protrusions) as a mask. In doing this, portions of the metal layer <b>73</b> under the respective bottoms of the recesses of the convex/concave pattern are removed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Then, an etching process using a gas for magnetic material is performed using remaining portions of the metal layer <b>73</b> as a mask. As a result, portions of the magnetic layer <b>72</b>, from which corresponding portions of the metal layer <b>73</b> have been removed, are etched off as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Then, an etching process using the gas for metal etching is performed to remove the remaining portions of the metal layer <b>73</b>. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, grooves are concentrically formed in the annular track-forming area <b>62</b> (corresponding to an annular area in the present invention) of the magnetic layer <b>72</b> (disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>), at the same pitch as the pitch of the protrusions <b>31</b> of the stamp <b>24</b>, whereby portions of the magnetic layer <b>72</b>, i.e. the discrete tracks <b>4</b>, separated from each other by the respective grooves are formed. At the same time, grooves arranged at the same pitch as the pitch of the protrusions <b>32</b> of the stamp <b>24</b> are formed in the outer peripheral part <b>65</b> (corresponding to an outer peripheral part in the present invention), which is located radially outward of the track-forming area <b>62</b>, and in the inner peripheral part <b>66</b>, which is located radially inward of the track-forming area <b>62</b>, of the magnetic layer <b>72</b> (disk-shaped substrate <b>61</b>), whereby portions of the magnetic layer <b>72</b> separated from each other by the respective grooves, i.e. non-data recording patterns <b>5</b>, are formed. Then, a surface finishing process is performed. In this process, first, the grooves are filled e.g. with silicon oxide, whereafter the surface is flattened using a CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polish) device. Then, a protective film is formed on the flattened surface by using DLC (Diamond Like Carbon), and finally, a lubricant is applied to the surface. Thus, the magnetic recording medium <b>3</b> is completed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In this case, since the recesses (protrusions) of the convex/concave pattern in the resin layer <b>63</b> are substantially uniform in depth (height), the discrete tracks <b>4</b> are also formed such that they are substantially uniform in height (i.e. substantially uniform in depth of the grooves separating the tracks). Further, since deformation or peeling of the pattern in the outer and inner peripheral portions <b>64</b><i>b </i>and <b>64</b><i>c </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b> is prevented, the discrete tracks <b>4</b> are formed without being deformed or lost, and therefore, an excellent magnetic recording medium <b>3</b> which does not cause a recording error can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method and the stamp <b>24</b>, since the protrusions <b>32</b> are formed in both of the outer area <b>27</b> located radially outward of the annular area <b>26</b> and the inner area <b>28</b> located radially inward of the annular area <b>26</b>, pressure applied to the resin layer <b>63</b> when the stamp <b>24</b> is pressed against the resin layer <b>63</b> can be dispersed between the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>, the outer peripheral part <b>65</b>, and the inner peripheral part <b>66</b>, of the resin layer <b>63</b>, so that substantially uniform pressure can be applied to the entire convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>. As a result, the recesses substantially uniform in depth (and protrusions substantially uniform in height) can be formed in the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>. Further, since concentration of pressure on the outer and inner peripheral portions <b>64</b><i>b </i>and <b>64</b><i>c </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b> can be positively prevented, deformation and peeling of the convex/concave pattern in the outer peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>b </i>and the inner peripheral portion <b>64</b><i>c </i>can also be positively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method and the stamp <b>24</b>, since the protrusions <b>32</b> are formed in both of the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b>, the pressure applied to the resin layer <b>63</b> when the stamp <b>24</b> is pressed against the resin layer <b>63</b> can be dispersed to both of the outer peripheral part <b>65</b> and the inner peripheral part <b>66</b>. Therefore, it is possible to more uniformly apply pressure to the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b> than when a method is employed which uses a stamp having protrusions <b>32</b> formed in only one of the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b>, whereby the recesses are made more uniform in depth.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, according to the convex/concave pattern-forming method and the stamp <b>24</b>, the protrusions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are each formed such that they have the same shape as that of the protrusions <b>31</b> and arranged at the same pitch, so that it is possible to continuously draw a pattern on the resin layer <b>25</b><i>a </i>e.g. by using the electron beam lithography device, so as to form convex/concave patterns for forming the protrusions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. This makes it possible to shorten a time period required for manufacturing the stamp <b>24</b>, thereby reducing manufacturing costs of the same.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">On the magnetic recording medium <b>3</b>, the discrete tracks <b>4</b> are formed using the convex/concave pattern which is formed in the resin layer <b>63</b> by the convex/concave pattern-forming method, so that the discrete tracks <b>4</b> in the entire convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b> are formed to be substantially uniform in height (uniform in depth of the grooves separating the tracks) without being deformed or peeled even in the outer and inner peripheral portions <b>64</b><i>b </i>and <b>64</b><i>c </i>of the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>. Therefore, according to the magnetic recording medium <b>3</b>, it is possible to positively prevent occurrence of a recording error.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment. For example, although the stamp <b>24</b> having the protrusions <b>32</b> formed in both of the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b> is employed in the embodiment, this is not limitative, but it is also possible to employ a stamp having the protrusions <b>32</b> formed in only one of the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, although in the above-described embodiment, the protrusions <b>32</b> are formed in the entire outer area <b>27</b> and the entire inner area <b>28</b>, it is possible to employ a stamp <b>81</b> that has a peripheral edge portion with a predetermined width which is not formed with any protrusions <b>32</b>, at a location radially outward (or inward) of the annular area <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Even with this arrangement, when the stamp <b>81</b> is pressed against the resin layer <b>63</b>, pressure applied to the resin layer <b>63</b> can be dispersed between the convex/concave pattern-forming area <b>64</b>, the outer peripheral part <b>65</b>, and the inner peripheral part <b>66</b>, of the resin layer <b>63</b>, which makes it possible to form a convex/concave pattern having recesses substantially uniform in depth. Further, since the area for forming the protrusions <b>32</b> can be reduced, the processed area of the stamp <b>81</b> can also be reduced in forming the stamp <b>81</b> by an amount corresponding to the reduced area. This makes it possible to reduce costs for processing the stamp <b>81</b>, thereby reducing manufacturing costs of the magnetic recording media <b>3</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, although the stamp <b>24</b> has the protrusions <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>, . . . concentrically formed in the annular area <b>26</b>, this is not limitative, but the present invention can also be applied to a stamp having a protrusion spirally formed (the protrusions are accurately expressed by “a single protrusion” since they are continuously formed). In this case, concentric protrusions <b>32</b> can be formed in one or both of the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b>, or spiral protrusions can be formed in one or both of the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b> in place of the concentric protrusions <b>32</b>. Further, alternatively, it is possible to form the spiral protrusions in only one of the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b>, and the concentric protrusions in the other. Moreover, although in the above described embodiment, the protrusions <b>32</b> identical in shape and pitch to the protrusions <b>31</b> are formed in the outer area <b>27</b> and the inner area <b>28</b>, this is not limitative, but protrusions different in shape can also be formed. Further, the protrusions <b>32</b> can be formed at a different pitch from that of the protrusions <b>31</b>. In this case, for example, it is possible to form the protrusions in the outer area <b>27</b> and/or the inner area <b>28</b> such that the width of a protrusion is increased as it is closer to the outer periphery of the stamp.</p>
