<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hammond in U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,023 teaches a service tray for use on a table with an umbrella pole in the center. The tray defines a slot and closure member for mounting to the tray around the pole with the closure member covering the slot. The connection of the closure member to the tray is readily released allowing the slot of the tray to be open permitting insertion around or removal from around the pole. The tray includes a number of compartments for receiving food, with rollers positioned on the underside to facilitate rotation of the tray on its supporting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,017,188 issued to Benton is for a combination patio table and pole fan. The invention utilizes a fan mounted on a pole that passes through the center of the patio table. The pole also supports an umbrella that can be used for shade when the table is located outside. The central pole for the device comes in three pieces to vacillate shipping and assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Waters in U.S. Pat. No. 6,192,878 discloses a heating apparatus that includes a perforated wall burner assembly housing containing a burner for igniting fuel from a fuel source. One improvement to the heating apparatus is the provision of a table that has a central opening for receipt of the pole or standard with the table top positioned above the heater base. Foldable legs of the table are pivoted out from under the table top to provide the table with stability when in use. The size of the legs may be coordinated with that of the base so that the table top is closely adjacent or in engagement with the top of the base. Alternatively the legs may be omitted from the table with the entire weight of the table top resting upon the base.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Jeng in U.S. design patent D456,498 presents the ornamental design of a combined gas heater and table with four legs mounted under the table for support. The table top is illustrated with perforations having a diamond shape.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. design patent D462,427 also issued to Jeng is for the ornamental design of a combined gas heater and table with the table top resting directly on the heater base for support. The table top is illustrated having a solid top with the upper portion of the base protruding slightly above the top in the center.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Application Publication No. US2005/0109247 of Nelson et al. discloses a rotatable tray mounted to a vertical pole having a truncated conical shape support sleeve attached thereto. The tray has a beveled bore in a truncate conical shaped inclining upwardly and outwardly to interface with the sleeve. An O-ring fits over the support sleeve and the pole fits into a hole in the center of the table top and is supported by a base.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Outdoor patios, yards, porches and courts are popular areas to enjoy the outdoors in pleasant weather and often meals are taken in these locales requiring tables and chairs. In cooler climates the season for this type of enjoyment is often extended by the use of patio heaters that usually operate using bottled liquefied gas and produce sufficient heat to make it comfortable enough to pursue this type of activity. It is desirable to be located close enough to the heater to gain the needed benefit requiring tables to be closely positioned to the heat source. Since conventional outdoor type patio tables are usually round and many have umbrellas protruding from the middle it is difficult to place the table close enough to the heater to gain the same advantage to all sitting around the table.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The requirement has existed to solve this long felt need therefore it is the primary object of the invention to provide a table that is easily assembled around the heater affording convenience and equal warmth without loosing valuable space on the table. The invention is made with two identical table halves that are placed one on each side of the heater and are aligned with a dowel pin and connected with threaded fasteners. A removable brace ring segment is attached in a similar manner on each side providing strength and rigidity to the legs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An important object of the invention is the ease of assembly since it consists of two separate but identical table sides that require only positioning together and connecting two wing nuts on each side. The two removable brace ring segments have slots on each end that are aligned with threaded studs furnished with wing nuts. The removable segments impart another object of the invention which presents the necessary utility of removing one of the segments to replace the fuel tank housed in the heater base.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still another object of the invention is in the design which makes it easy to manufacture as there are two duplicate halves and duplicate brace ring segments permitting the same tooling and manufacturing procedures to be used which achieves economies of number reducing the final cost of manufacture to be well within the reach of the masses.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet another object of the invention is its ease of storage because a conventional patio table is made in one piece and requires considerable storage space. Since the invention is made in two sections it actually cuts the envelope size in half reducing the space by 50 percent of a normal outdoor table since the sections may be stacked in reverse and nested together.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A further object of the invention it in the fact that it is made of fireproof metal which is safe to be employed next to the heater and furthermore the construction is solid and robust as it is basically produced as a weldment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A final object of the invention is the feature that adjusts the table height to correspond with almost any heater available on today's market. The adjustment also permits the table to be leveled on uneven patio surfaces particularly flagstone and other similar surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While the invention is primarily designed as a patio heater table the utility may be equally utilized as a table having an umbrella mounted in the middle which is easily substituted and works just as well. This dual function is important as the table may be used in the summer when it is hot and shade is the favored commodity as an umbrella table and when it turns cold as a heater table.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

The optional connecting means described above are not shown in the drawings as they are all well known in the art and are off-the-shelf in wide distribution throughout this country.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The permanent brace ring segment <b>52</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref> and the removable brace ring segment <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrating the slot <b>56</b> in greater detail and the studs <b>40</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>. The permanent brace ring segment <b>52</b> and removable brace ring segment <b>54</b> are preferably formed from a metal bar of steel or aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The table <b>10</b> may have any shape and still be within the scope of the invention even though the drawings depict the round shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-28</figref> shows some of the different shapes anticipated such as a square shaped table <b>58</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> a rectangular table <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> and a oval shaped table <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. Even the shapes illustrated are not the only configurations applicable as hexagonal, polygonal or irregular shapes are also viable alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To assemble the patio heater table <b>10</b> over a patio heater <b>14</b> one of the table sides <b>20</b> is placed on one side of the heater <b>14</b> and the other side <b>20</b> on the opposite aspect with the sides <b>20</b> urged together with the alignment pins <b>32</b> entering the mating bores <b>36</b> while simultaneously the threaded studs <b>40</b> enter the clearance holes <b>42</b>. Wing nuts <b>44</b>, or like threaded fasteners, are screwed on the studs <b>40</b> rigidly securing the table halves together. The removable brace ring segments <b>54</b> are then mated with the flanged ends of the permanent brace ring segments <b>52</b> with the slots <b>56</b> slid onto threaded studs <b>40</b> and wing nuts <b>44</b> or the like screwed in place. If the fuel in the heater <b>14</b> is depleted one of the removable brace ring segments <b>54</b> may be detached for convenience</p>
