<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/829,809, filed on Apr. 22, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,168,899.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for precisely centering workpieces to be machined or otherwise shaped on a machine tool.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The term “airfoil” broadly describes several species of elongate machined parts, such as blades, vanes and nozzles. As used in this application the term “workpiece” is used to describe any object to be shaped while centered on a machine tool, and the term “airfoil” refers to machined parts, such as blades, vanes and the like that are incorporated into fanjet engines, gas turbines and the like. This application describes the invention in the particular environment of the manufacture of airfoils. Such airfoils must be precisely machined to a predetermined aerodynamic shape having critical tolerances that must be duplicated from airfoil to airfoil. At the high rotational speeds of operation found in turbine engines, any excessive deviation from the required shape can cause high rates of wear, vibration and even catastrophic failure. Care is therefore required in mounting, for example, a blank in a machine tool, or fixture, where the blank will be machined into an airfoil such as a jet engine blade or vane.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As disclosed and explained in this application by way of example, an improved apparatus and method is provided for centering a workpiece such as a fan rotor blade in a fixture for a dovetail machining operation. A fan rotor blade includes a tip, an opposed root and a midspan region extending between the tip and root, and which defines the major longitudinal extent of the blade. A number of details must be machined into the workpiece during formation of the blade. These include a plurality of dovetails formed in the root by which the blade is mounted and secured to the rotor disk of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Reference is made to applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 6,068,541 that discloses the general machine environment within which the present invention is practiced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Prior art devices and methods for centering workpieces for a machining operation include an operator-manipulated hand screw used to tighten a centering pin against a tip-locating block temporarily mounted on the tip of the workpiece to be shaped into the airfoil. This centering method introduces an unavoidable degree of variation into the workpiece loading process because no two operators will have the same “feel” for the proper clamping technique. Typically, prior art practices result in a varying amount of torque being applied to the hand screw, and thus a varying amount of tension directed along the stack axis of the workpiece during machining. Insufficient tension on the workpiece can result in movement during the process of clamping the workpiece into a stationary position and a mislocation relative to the workpiece-engaging milling tools. Similarly, excessive tension can result in distortion of the workpiece, deviation from the required stack axis location and misalignment of subsequently-machined features on the workpiece.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of the invention an improved method and apparatus is provided for centering a workpiece on a machine tool, or fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment of the invention, a method and apparatus is provided for centering a workpiece that exerts a constant, repeatable tension on the workpiece during the mounting and centering process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided for centering a workpiece on a machine tool that includes first and second guide plates having respective first and second aligned bores therein for supporting a centering pin mounted therein for axial movement between a retracted position and a use position. The centering pin cooperates with a workpiece for positioning the workpiece in a predetermined position relative to a metal shaping operation to be carried out by the machine on the workpiece. At least one spring cooperates with the centering pin for exerting a predetermined axial bias for urging the centering pin into the use position. A lock locks the centering pin in the use position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the invention first and second guide plates are provided having respective first and second aligned bores therein for supporting a centering pin mounted therein for axial movement between a retracted position and a use position. The centering pin cooperates with a workpiece for positioning the workpiece in a predetermined position relative to a milling operation to be carried out by the machine on the workpiece. At least one flat, triple beam spring cooperates with a rear end of the centering pin for exerting a predetermined axial bias for urging the centering pin in a forward direction into the use position. A lock is provided for locking the centering pin in the use position.</p>

A tip locator block having an angled inset matching a taper on a front end of the centering pin is provided for receiving the taper therein, and a blade-receiving mount is provided for being positioned on an end of the blade to be supported in a fixed position during milling. A locking strap is extended over the top of the centering pin from one radial side to the other and is moveable between a release position allowing axial movement of the centering pin and a lock position for locking the centering pin in the use position. An actuator in the form of a hydraulic cylinder is operatively connected to one end of the locking strap for selectively moving the strap between a release position wherein the centering pin is axially moveable and the lock position.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> of the drawings, a milling fixture for centering and clamping in position a fan rotor blade “B” is shown generally at reference numeral <b>10</b>. The fixture <b>10</b> includes a mounting plate <b>11</b> by which the fixture <b>10</b> is mounted to a support, not shown. The fixture <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> mounts the blade “B” by means of a tip mounting block <b>12</b> that engages a centering apparatus <b>20</b> according to an embodiment of the invention, and an opposed mounting block <b>13</b> by which the root end of the blade “B” is located and fixed in a stationary position. The mounting block <b>13</b> and centering fixture <b>20</b> are each mounted on a base <b>15</b>. With the blade properly mounted in the fixture <b>10</b>, milling operations are performed on the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The centering apparatus <b>20</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>. The centering apparatus <b>20</b> includes a pair of guide plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, a mounting plate <b>23</b>, a centering pin <b>25</b>, a pin stop <b>27</b>, a hydraulic locking assembly <b>30</b>, including a locking plate <b>31</b>, and a triple-beam flat spring <b>32</b>. The guide plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, mounting plate <b>23</b>, pin stop <b>27</b>, and locking assembly <b>30</b> are joined by bolts, not shown, extending through suitably-positioned bolt holes <b>33</b> and attached to the base <b>15</b> of the fixture <b>10</b>. Spacers <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> provide proper spacing between the above-described elements.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The guide plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are provided with respective bores <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> therein within which the centering pin <b>25</b> is mounted for limited movement along its longitudinal axis. Bores <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> include respective V-nests <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> that provide a stable support for the centering pin <b>25</b> by reducing the surface area of contact and thus increasing the force per unit of area with which the centering pin <b>25</b> is engaged with the guide plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the centering pin <b>25</b> includes a large diameter portion <b>25</b>A, a relatively small diameter portion <b>25</b>B defined by a shoulder <b>45</b>, and a tapered portion <b>25</b>C terminating at a sharp tip end <b>25</b>D. The small diameter portion <b>25</b>B of the centering pin <b>25</b> provides clearance between the centering pin <b>25</b>, the bore <b>41</b> in guide plate <b>22</b> and a bore <b>47</b> in the pin stop <b>27</b>. The bore <b>47</b> in the pin stop <b>27</b> has a diameter greater than the diameter of the small diameter portion <b>25</b>B of the centering pin <b>25</b> and thus provides a stop reference point defining the limit of axial movement of the centering point towards the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> further illustrates the locking assembly <b>30</b>. The locking plate <b>31</b> carries a locking strap <b>50</b> that extend over the centering pin <b>25</b> and engages the large diameter portion <b>25</b>A. The locking strap is integrally-formed with the locking plate <b>31</b> and is preferably fabricated of D2 tool steel having a hardness of between 48-52 on the Rockwell C scale.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The free end <b>51</b> of the locking strap <b>50</b> is pinned to an actuator in the form of a hydraulic cylinder <b>55</b>. The locking plate <b>31</b> is provided with a downwardly tapered surface <b>56</b> that cooperatively engages a curved inner surface <b>58</b> of the free end <b>51</b> of the locking strap <b>50</b>. Thus, actuation of the cylinder <b>55</b> forces engagement between the free end <b>51</b> of the locking strap <b>50</b> against the tapered surface <b>56</b>, causing the inward force to be translated into a downward shearing force along the tapered surface <b>56</b>, thus tightening the strap against the centering pin <b>25</b>, and in turn forcing the centering pin <b>25</b> into a locked position against the V-nests <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> of the guide plates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with the best mode of the invention, the triple-beam spring <b>32</b> is mounted on the rear side of the guide plate <b>21</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>. The spring <b>32</b> is preferably fabricated of 1095 blue spring steel, 0.77 mm (0.030 inch) thick. The spring has two beams <b>60</b>, <b>61</b> that are bolted to the guide plate <b>21</b> and a centrally-disposed beam <b>62</b> that is formed with a predetermined bend biased towards the guide plate <b>21</b>. When mounted flat against the guide plate <b>21</b> the beam <b>62</b> is forced out of its bent position into a torqued position exerting a predetermined reactive force against the end of the centering pin <b>25</b>. This force is predictable and uniform, thus exerting a correspondingly predictable and uniform force on the centering pin <b>25</b> along its longitudinal axis and parallel to the stack axis of the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">During setup the blade is positioned in the fixture <b>10</b> against several fixed locators with the tip of the blade positioned in a slot <b>65</b> in the tip mounting block <b>12</b>. Compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The tip mounting block <b>12</b> has a machined inset <b>67</b> that has an angle of taper that matches the taper of the tapered portion <b>25</b>C of the centering pin <b>25</b>. Positioning the centering pin <b>25</b> in the inset <b>67</b> provides a positive mounting location for the tip of the blade. The constant, uniform force applied by the beam <b>62</b> against the rear end of the centering pin <b>25</b> produces a constant alignment force from blade to blade. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the spring beam <b>62</b> exerts a force of 20 pounds. However, the magnitude of the force is not critical so long as the force is sufficient to firmly set the tapered portion <b>25</b>C of the centering pin <b>25</b> firmly into the inset <b>67</b> of the tip mounting block <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With the centering pin <b>25</b> positioned in the inset <b>67</b> of the tip mounting block <b>12</b>, the blade is located and clamped into the fixture <b>10</b> with hydraulic cylinders, including the hydraulic cylinder <b>55</b> and primary hydraulic cylinders <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> mounted on the mounting block <b>13</b>. The actuation of the hydraulic cylinders is sequenced so that the locking strap <b>50</b> is engaged before the primary hydraulic cylinders. This ensures that the stack axis alignment of the blade is correct before actuation of the primary hydraulic cylinders, including cylinders <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An apparatus and method for centering a workpiece such as a fan blade is described above. Various details of the invention may be changed without departing from its scope. Furthermore, the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention and the best mode for practicing the invention are provided for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation—the invention being defined by the claims.</p>
