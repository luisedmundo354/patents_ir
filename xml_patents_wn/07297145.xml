<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides systems, apparatus and methods for selectively applying electrical energy to body tissue in order to ablate, contract, coagulate, or otherwise modify a target tissue or organ. The closed configuration is adapted for clamping and coagulating a target tissue while the apparatus is operating in the sub-ablation mode, while the open configuration is adapted for ablating the target tissue via molecular dissociation of tissue components. A method of the present invention comprises clamping a target tissue or organ with an electrosurgical probe. A first high frequency voltage is applied between the active electrode and the return electrode to effect coagulation of the clamped tissue. Thereafter, a second high frequency voltage is applied to effect localized molecular dissociation of the coagulated tissue.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to electrosurgical systems and methods for ablating, severing, contracting, or otherwise modifying target tissues or organs. The invention relates more particularly to electrosurgical apparatus and methods for coagulating a tissue or organ and for ablating the coagulated tissue or organ via molecular dissociation of tissue components. The present invention further relates to electrosurgical methods and apparatus for clamping a target tissue or blood vessel prior to coagulating and severing the tissue or blood vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional electrosurgical instruments and techniques are widely used in surgical procedures because they generally reduce patient bleeding and trauma associated with cutting operations, as compared with mechanical cutting and the like. Conventional electrosurgical procedures may be classified as operating in monopolar or bipolar mode. Monopolar techniques rely on external grounding of the patient, where the surgical device defines only a single electrode pole. Bipolar devices have two electrodes for the application of current between their surfaces. Conventional electrosurgical devices and procedures, however, suffer from a number of disadvantages. For example, conventional electrosurgical cutting devices typically operate by creating a voltage difference between the active electrode and the target tissue, causing an electrical arc to form across the physical gap between the electrode and the tissue. At the point of contact of the electric arcs with the tissue, rapid tissue heating occurs due to high current density between the electrode and the tissue. This high current density causes cellular fluids to rapidly vaporize into steam, thereby producing a “cutting effect” along the pathway of localized tissue heating. Thus, the tissue is parted along the pathway of evaporated cellular fluid, inducing undesirable collateral tissue damage in regions surrounding the target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, monopolar electrosurgical devices generally direct electric current along a defined path from the exposed or active electrode through the patient's body to the return electrode, the latter externally attached to a suitable location on the patient. This creates the potential danger that the electric current will flow through undefined paths in the patient's body, thereby increasing the risk of unwanted electrical stimulation to portions of the patient's body. In addition, since the defined path through the patient's body has a relatively high electrical impedance, large voltage differences must typically be applied between the return and active electrodes in order to generate a current suitable for ablation or cutting of the target tissue. This current, however, may inadvertently flow along body paths having less impedance than the defined electrical path, which will substantially increase the current flowing through these paths, possibly causing damage to or destroying surrounding tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Bipolar electrosurgical devices have an inherent advantage over monopolar devices because the return current path does not flow through the patient. In bipolar electrosurgical devices, both the active and return electrode are typically exposed so that both electrodes may contact tissue, thereby providing a return current path from the active to the return electrode through the tissue. One drawback with this configuration, however, is that the return electrode may cause tissue desiccation or destruction at its contact point with the patient's tissue. In addition, the active and return electrodes are typically positioned close together to ensure that the return current flows directly from the active to the return electrode. The close proximity of these electrodes generates the danger that the current will short across the electrodes, possibly impairing the electrical control system and/or damaging or destroying surrounding tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, conventional electrosurgical methods are generally ineffective for ablating certain types of tissue, and in certain types of environments within the body. For example, loose or elastic connective tissue, such as the synovial tissue in joints, is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to remove with conventional electrosurgical instruments because the flexible tissue tends to move away from the instrument when it is brought against this tissue. Since conventional techniques rely mainly on conducting current through the tissue, they are not effective when the instrument cannot be brought adjacent to, or in contact with, the elastic tissue for a sufficient period of time to energize the electrode and conduct current through the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a need for a general-purpose electrosurgical apparatus adapted for the precise removal or modification of a target tissue or organ at a specific location, wherein the target tissue or organ can be ablated, severed, resected, contracted, and/or coagulated, with minimal, or no, collateral tissue damage. The instant invention provides such an apparatus and related methods, wherein the apparatus includes at least one moveable electrode, and at least a portion of the target tissue or organ may be clamped between an active electrode and a return electrode prior to coagulation of the tissue or organ. Following coagulation, the coagulated tissue or organ may be ablated or severed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention generally provides systems, apparatus, and methods for selectively applying electrical energy to cut, incise, ablate, or otherwise modify a tissue or organ of a patient. In one aspect, the electrosurgical systems and methods of the invention are useful for resecting a tissue or organ having a plurality of blood vessels running therethrough, wherein, using a single probe, each blood vessel encountered during resection of the tissue or organ may be clamped, coagulated, and then severed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of creating an incision in a body structure. An electrosurgical probe is positioned adjacent the target tissue so that one or more active electrode(s) are brought into at least partial contact or close proximity with the target tissue. High frequency voltage is then applied between the active electrode(s) and one or more return electrode(s) and the active electrode(s) are moved, translated, reciprocated, or otherwise manipulated to cut through a portion of the tissue. In some embodiments, an electrically conductive fluid, e.g., isotonic saline or conductive gel, is delivered or applied to the target site to substantially surround the active electrode(s) with the fluid. In other embodiments, the active electrode(s) are immersed within the electrically conductive fluid. In both embodiments, the high frequency voltage may be selected to locally ablate or sever a target tissue, and/or to effect a controlled depth of hemostasis of severed blood vessels within the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, tissue is cut or otherwise modified by molecular dissociation or disintegration processes. (In contrast, in conventional electrosurgery tissue is cut by rapidly heating the tissue until cellular fluids explode, producing a cutting effect along the pathway of localized heating.) The present invention volumetrically removes the tissue along the cutting pathway in a cool ablation process that minimizes thermal damage to surrounding tissue. In these embodiments, the high frequency voltage applied to the active electrode(s) is sufficient to vaporize the electrically conductive fluid (e.g., gel or saline) between the active electrode(s) and the tissue. Within the vaporized fluid, a plasma is formed and charged particles (e.g., electrons) cause the molecular breakdown or disintegration of the tissue, perhaps to a depth of several cell layers. This molecular dissociation is accompanied by the volumetric removal of the tissue, e.g., along the incision of the tissue. This process can be precisely controlled to effect the volumetric removal of tissue as thin as 10 microns to 150 microns with minimal heating of, or damage to, surrounding or underlying tissue structures. A more complete description of this phenomenon is described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,366, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Apparatus according to the present invention generally include an electrosurgical instrument, such as a probe or catheter, having a shaft with proximal and distal ends, one or more active electrode(s) at the distal end and one or more connectors coupling the active electrode(s) to a source of high frequency electrical energy. The active electrode(s) are preferably designed for cutting tissue; i.e., they typically have a distal edge or point. In one embodiment, a plurality of active electrodes are aligned with each other to form a linear electrode array for cutting a path through the tissue. In another exemplary embodiment, the active electrode(s) include a sharp distal point to facilitate the cutting of the target tissue. In one specific configuration, the active electrode is a blade having a sharp distal point and sides. As the sharp distal point incises the tissue, the sides of the blade slidingly contact the incised tissue. The electrical current flows through that portion of the tissue in the vicinity of the active electrode and/or the conductive fluid to the return electrode, such that the target tissue is first severed, and then the severed tissue is coagulated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The apparatus can further include a fluid delivery element for delivering electrically conductive fluid to the active electrode(s) and the target site. The fluid delivery element may be located on the probe, e.g., a fluid lumen or tube, or it may be part of a separate instrument. Alternatively, an electrically conductive gel or spray, such as a saline electrolyte or other conductive gel, may be applied the target site. In this embodiment, the apparatus may not have a fluid delivery element. In both embodiments, the electrically conductive fluid preferably provides a current flow path between the active electrode(s) and one or more return electrode(s). In an exemplary embodiment, the return electrode is located on the probe and spaced a sufficient distance from the active electrode(s) to substantially avoid or minimize current shorting therebetween and to shield the return electrode from tissue at the target site.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a specific configuration, the electrosurgical probe includes an electrically insulating electrode support member having a tissue treatment surface at the distal end of the probe. One or more active electrode(s) are coupled to, or integral with, the electrode support member such that the active electrode(s) are spaced from the return electrode. In one embodiment, the probe includes a plurality of active electrode(s) having distal edges linearly aligned with each other to form a sharp cutting path for cutting tissue. The active electrodes are preferably electrically isolated from each other, and they extend about 0.2 mm to about 10 mm distally from the tissue treatment surface of the electrode support member. In this embodiment, the probe may further include one or more lumens for delivering electrically conductive fluid to one or more openings around the tissue treatment surface of the electrode support member. In an exemplary embodiment, the lumen extends through a fluid tube exterior to the probe shaft that ends proximal to the return electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect of the invention, there is provided an electrosurgical probe having a blade-like active electrode affixed to an electrically insulating electrode support on the distal end of a shaft. In a specific configuration, the active electrode is in the form of a blade, comprising a substantially flat metal blade having at least one active edge and first and second blade sides. In one embodiment, the active electrode comprises a hook. The hook may include a curved portion. One or more portions of the hook may have a serrated edge. The return electrode is typically located on the shaft distal end proximal to the electrode support. In use, the active electrode and the return electrode are coupled to opposite poles of a high frequency power supply. The active edge may have a variety of shapes, and is adapted for generating high current densities thereon, and for precisely severing or ablating tissue or an organ in a highly controlled manner via molecular dissociation of tissue components. The first and second blade sides are adapted for engaging with tissue, such as tissue severed by the active edge, and for coagulating tissue engaged therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for modifying a tissue using an electrosurgical probe having an active electrode in the form of a single blade which includes at least one active edge and first and second blade sides. The method involves positioning the probe such that the active electrode makes contact with, or is in close proximity to, a target tissue; and applying a high frequency voltage between the active and return electrodes sufficient to precisely sever or remove target tissue via molecular dissociation of tissue components adjacent to the active edge. The probe may be manipulated during the application of the high frequency voltage such that the active electrode is moved with respect to the target tissue. According to one aspect of the invention, the configuration of the active electrode (e.g., a hook shaped electrode) is adapted for severing tissue as the probe distal end is drawn or pulled towards the operator of the probe. In this manner, the extent to which the tissue is severed can be precisely controlled. Thereafter, the severed tissue may be coagulated upon engagement of the tissue against the first and second blade sides of the active electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided an electrosurgical system including a probe having a shaft distal end. An active electrode and a return electrode are disposed at the shaft distal end. At least one of the active electrode and the return electrode are moveable, such that the probe can adopt an open configuration or a closed configuration. In the open configuration, a target tissue or organ may be positioned between the active and return electrodes, and thereafter the probe may be urged towards the closed configuration such that the target tissue or organ is effectively clamped between the active and return electrodes. While the target tissue or organ is thus clamped, a suitable high frequency voltage may be applied between the active and return electrodes so as to coagulate the tissue or organ. Thereafter, the coagulated tissue or organ may be unclamped or released by forcing the probe towards the open configuration. With the target tissue or organ in at least close proximity to the active electrode, a second high frequency voltage may be applied between the active and return electrodes so as to ablate or sever the coagulated tissue or organ via localized molecular dissociation of tissue components.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the probe is shifted between the open and closed configurations via an actuator unit including at least one of a clamp unit and a release unit. In one aspect, actuation of the actuator unit serves to switch the electrosurgical system, via a mode switch, between an ablation mode and a sub-ablation mode. In another aspect, a mode switch is responsive either to a change in configuration of the probe between the open and closed configurations, or to movement of a moveable electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, there is provided a bipolar electrosurgical clamp including a return electrode in the form of a moveable cowl or hood. In one embodiment, the cowl includes a distal notch for accommodating a portion of the active electrode which protrudes laterally from the probe. In another embodiment, the moveable cowl includes an undulating perimeter adapted for gripping a target tissue or organ. In one embodiment, the moveable cowl is pivotable about its proximal end between a closed- and an open configuration. In yet another aspect, there is provided a bipolar electrosurgical clamp including a moveable active electrode, which can be pivoted between a closed- and an open configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The electrosurgical probe of the invention is applicable to a broad range of procedures, including without limitation: cutting, resection, ablation, and/or hemostasis of tissues and organs such as prostate, liver, bowel, intestine, gall bladder, uterus, tissue in laparascopic or open surgical procedures (e.g., cholecystectomy, Nissen fundoplication, bowel resection, hysterectomy, adhesiolysis and the like), scar tissue, myocardial tissue, and tissues of the knee, shoulder, hip, and other joints; procedures of the head and neck, such as of the ear, mouth, throat, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, nasal cavity, and sinuses; as well as procedures involving skin tissue removal and/or collagen shrinkage in the epidermis or dermis. A more detailed account of various treatments and procedures which may be carried out according to the invention is set forth in enabling detail hereinbelow.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present invention provides systems and methods for selectively applying electrical energy to a target location within or on a patient's body, particularly for cutting, ablating, clamping, and coagulating a tissue using an electrosurgical probe. The instant invention also provides apparatus and methods for making incisions to access a tissue or organ within a patient's body, to dissect or harvest the tissue or organ from the patient, and to transect, resect, or otherwise modify the tissue or organ. The present invention is useful in procedures where the target tissue or organ is, or can be, flooded or submerged with an electrically conductive fluid, such as isotonic saline. In addition, tissues which may be treated by the system and method of the present invention further include, but are not limited to, tissues of the heart, chest, knee, shoulder, ankle, hip, elbow, hand or foot; as well as prostate tissue, leiomyomas (fibroids) located within the uterus, gingival tissues and mucosal tissues located in the mouth, tumors, scar tissue, myocardial tissue, collagenous tissue within the eye; together with epidermal and dermal tissues on the surface of the skin. The present invention is also useful for resecting tissue within accessible sites of the body that are suitable for electrode loop resection, such as the resection of prostate tissue, leiomyomas (fibroids) located within the uterus, or other tissue to be removed from the body.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The present invention is also useful for procedures in the head and neck, such as the ear, mouth, throat, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, nasal cavity, and sinuses. These procedures may be performed through the mouth or nose using speculae or gags, or using endoscopic techniques, such as functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). These procedures may include the removal of swollen tissue, chronically-diseased inflamed and hypertrophic mucus linings, polyps and/or neoplasms from the various anatomical sinuses of the skull, the turbinates and nasal passages, in the tonsil, adenoid, epi-glottic and supra-glottic regions, and salivary glands, submucus resection of the nasal septum, excision of diseased tissue and the like. In other procedures, the present invention may be useful for cutting, resection, ablation and/or hemostasis of tissue in procedures for treating snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (e.g., UPPP procedures), for gross tissue removal, such as tonsillectomies, adenoidectomies, tracheal stenosis and vocal cord polyps and lesions, or for the resection or ablation of facial tumors or tumors within the mouth and pharynx, such as glossectomies, laryngectomies, acoustic neuroma procedures and nasal ablation procedures. In addition, the present invention is useful for procedures within the ear, such as stapedotomies, tympanostomies, myringotomies, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present invention may also be useful for cosmetic and plastic surgery procedures in the head and neck. For example, the present invention is particularly useful for ablation and sculpting of cartilage tissue, such as the cartilage within the nose that is sculpted during rhinoplasty procedures. The present invention may also be employed for skin tissue removal and/or collagen shrinkage in the epidermis or dermis tissue in the head and neck region, e.g., the removal of pigmentations, vascular lesions, scars, tattoos, etc., and for other surgical procedures on the skin, such as tissue rejuvenation, cosmetic eye procedures (blepharoplasties), wrinkle removal, tightening muscles for facelifts or browlifts, hair removal and/or transplant procedures, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The present invention is also useful for harvesting blood vessels, such as a blood vessel to be used as a graft vessel during the CABG procedure, e.g., the saphenous vein and the internal mammary artery (IMA). One or more embodiments of the invention may be used as follows: i) to access the blood vessel to be harvested, e.g., by opening the leg to access the saphenous vein, or opening the chest (either via a longitudinal incision of the sternum during an open-chest procedure, or during a minimally invasive inter-costal procedure); ii) to dissect the blood vessel to be harvested from the surrounding connective tissue along at least a portion of its length; and iii) to transect the dissected blood vessel at a first position only in the case of a pedicled graft (IMA), or at the first position and at a second position in the case of a free graft (saphenous vein). In each case i) to iii), as well as for other embodiment of the invention, the procedure involves removal of tissue by a cool ablation procedure in which a high frequency voltage is applied to an active electrode in the vicinity of a target tissue, typically in the presence of an electrically conductive fluid. The cool ablation procedure of the invention is described fully elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The electrically conductive fluid may be a bodily fluid such as blood or synovial fluid, intracellular fluid of the target tissue, or isotonic saline delivered to the target tissue during the procedure. In one embodiment, apparatus of the invention includes a probe adapted for being shifted between an open configuration and a closed configuration. The present invention is useful for coagulating blood or blood vessels, for example, for coagulating blood vessels traversing a target tissue during incising or resecting the target tissue. The present invention is also useful for clamping a target tissue or blood vessel prior to coagulating the tissue or blood vessel, and for severing or ablating the coagulated tissue or blood vessel. Apparatus of the present invention may also be used to ablate or otherwise modify a target tissue without prior coagulation of the target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Although certain parts of this disclosure are directed specifically to creating incisions for accessing a patient's thoracic cavity and the harvesting and dissection of blood vessels within the body during a CABG procedure, systems and methods of the invention are equally applicable to other procedures involving other organs or tissues of the body, including minimally invasive procedures, other open procedures, intravascular procedures, urological procedures, laparascopy, arthroscopy, thoracoscopy or other cardiac procedures, cosmetic surgery, orthopedics, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology, spinal and neurologic procedures, oncology, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In methods of the present invention, high frequency (RF) electrical energy is usually applied to one or more active electrodes in the presence of an electrically conductive fluid to remove and/or modify target tissue, an organ, or a body structure. Depending on the specific procedure, the present invention may be used to: (1) create incisions in tissue; (2) dissect or harvest tissue; (3) volumetrically remove tissue or cartilage (i.e., ablate or effect molecular dissociation of the tissue); (4) cut, incise, transect, or resect tissue or an organ (e.g., a blood vessel); (5) create perforations or holes within tissue; and/or (6) coagulate blood and severed blood vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one method of the present invention, the tissue structures are incised by volumetrically removing or ablating tissue along a cutting path. In this procedure, a high frequency voltage difference is applied between one or more active electrode (s) and one or more return electrode(s) to develop high electric field intensities in the vicinity of the target tissue site. The high electric field intensities lead to electric field induced molecular breakdown of target tissue through molecular dissociation (rather than thermal evaporation or carbonization). Applicant believes that the tissue structure is volumetrically removed through molecular disintegration of larger organic molecules into smaller molecules and/or atoms, such as hydrogen, oxides of carbon, hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds. This molecular disintegration completely removes the tissue structure, as opposed to dehydrating the tissue material by the removal of liquid within the cells of the tissue, as is typically the case with electrosurgical desiccation and vaporization.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The high electric field intensities may be generated by applying a high frequency voltage that is sufficient to vaporize an electrically conductive fluid over at least a portion of the active electrode(s) in the region between the tip of the active electrode(s) and the target tissue. The electrically conductive fluid may be a gas or liquid, such as isotonic saline, delivered to the target site, or a viscous fluid, such as a gel, that is located at the target site. In the latter embodiment, the active electrode(s) are submersed in the electrically conductive gel during the surgical procedure. Since the vapor layer or vaporized region has a relatively high electrical impedance, it minimizes the current flow into the electrically conductive fluid. Within the vaporized fluid a plasma is formed, and charged particles (e.g., electrons) cause the localized molecular dissociation or disintegration of components of the target tissue, to a depth of perhaps several cell layers. This molecular dissociation results in the volumetric removal of tissue from the target site. This ablation process, which typically subjects the target tissue to a temperature in the range of 40° C. to 70° C., can be precisely controlled to effect the removal of tissue to a depth as little as about 10 microns, with little or no thermal or other damage to surrounding tissue. This cool ablation phenomenon has been termed Coblation®.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">While not being bound by theory, applicant believes that the principle mechanism of tissue removal in the Coblation® mechanism of the present invention is energetic electrons or ions that have been energized in a plasma adjacent to the active electrode(s). When a liquid is heated sufficiently that atoms vaporize from the liquid at a greater rate than they recondense, a gas is formed. When the gas is heated sufficiently that the atoms collide with each other and electrons are removed from the atoms in the process, an ionized gas or plasma is formed. (A more complete description of plasmas (the so-called “fourth state of matter”) can be found in Plasma Physics, by R. J. Goldston and P. H. Rutherford of the Plasma Physics Laboratory of Princeton University (1995), the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.) When the density of the vapor layer (or within a bubble formed in the electrically conductive liquid) becomes sufficiently low (i.e., less than approximately 10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>for aqueous solutions), the electron mean free path increases to enable subsequently injected electrons to cause impact ionization within these regions of low density (i.e., vapor layers or bubbles). Once the ionic particles in the plasma layer have sufficient energy, they accelerate towards the target tissue. Energy evolved by the energetic electrons (e.g., 3.5 eV to 5 eV) can subsequently bombard a molecule and break its bonds, dissociating a molecule into free radicals, which then combine into final gaseous or liquid species.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Plasmas may be formed by heating and ionizing a gas by driving an electric current through it, or by transmitting radio waves into the gas. Generally, these methods of plasma formation give energy to free electrons in the plasma directly, and then electron-atom collisions liberate more electrons, and the process cascades until the desired degree of ionization is achieved. Often, the electrons carry the electrical current or absorb the radio waves and, therefore, are hotter than the ions. Thus, in applicant's invention, the electrons, which are carried away from the tissue towards the return electrode, carry most of the plasma's heat with them, allowing the ions to break apart the tissue molecules in a substantially non-thermal manner.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The energy evolved by the energetic electrons may be varied by adjusting a variety of factors, such as: the number of active electrodes; electrode size and spacing; electrode surface area; asperities and sharp edges on the electrode surfaces; electrode materials; applied voltage and power; current limiting means, such as inductors; electrical conductivity of the fluid in contact with the electrodes; density of the fluid; electrical insulators over the electrodes; and other factors. Accordingly, these factors can be manipulated to control the energy level of the excited electrons. Since different tissue structures have different molecular bonds, the present invention can be configured to break the molecular bonds of certain tissue, while having too low an energy to break the molecular bonds of other tissue. For example, fatty tissue, (e.g., adipose tissue) contains a large amount of lipid material having double bonds, the breakage of which requires an energy level substantially higher than 4 eV to 5 eV. Accordingly, the present invention can be configured such that lipid components of adipose tissue are selectively not ablated. Of course, the present invention may be used to effectively ablate cells of adipose tissue such that the inner fat content of the cells is released in a liquid form. Alternatively, the invention can be configured (e.g., by increasing the voltage or changing the electrode configuration to increase the current density at the electrode tips) such that the double bonds of lipid materials are readily broken leading to molecular dissociation of lipids into low molecular weight condensable gases, generally as described hereinabove. A more complete description of the Coblation® phenomenon can be found in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,366 and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/032,375, filed Feb. 27, 1998, the complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Methods of the present invention typically involve the application of high frequency (RF) electrical energy to one or more active electrodes in an electrically conductive environment to remove (i.e., resect, incise, perforate, cut, or ablate) a target tissue, structure, or organ; and/or to seal one or more blood vessels within the region of the target tissue. The present invention is particularly useful for sealing larger arterial vessels, e.g., having a diameter on the order of 1 mm or greater. In some embodiments, a high frequency power supply is provided having an ablation mode, wherein a first voltage is applied to an active electrode sufficient to effect molecular dissociation or disintegration of the tissue; and a coagulation mode, wherein a second, lower voltage is applied to an active electrode (either the same or a different electrode) sufficient to achieve hemostasis of severed vessels within the tissue. In other embodiments, an electrosurgical probe is provided having one or more coagulation electrode(s) configured for sealing a severed vessel, such as an arterial vessel, and one or more active electrodes configured for either contracting the collagen fibers within the tissue or removing (ablating) the tissue, e.g., by applying sufficient energy to the tissue to effect molecular dissociation. In the latter embodiments, the coagulation electrode(s) may be configured such that a single voltage can be applied to both coagulate with the coagulation electrode(s), and to ablate or contract tissue with the active electrode(s). In other embodiments, the power supply is combined with the coagulation probe such that the coagulation electrode is used when the power supply is in the coagulation mode (low voltage), and the active electrode(s) are used when the power supply is in the ablation mode (higher voltage).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one method of the present invention, one or more active electrodes are brought into close proximity to tissue at a target site, and the power supply is activated in the ablation mode such that sufficient voltage is applied between the active electrodes and the return electrode to volumetrically remove the tissue through molecular dissociation, as described above. During this process, vessels within the tissue are severed. Smaller vessels may be automatically sealed with the system and method of the present invention. Larger vessels and those with a higher flow rate, such as arterial vessels, may not be automatically sealed in the ablation mode. In these cases, the severed vessels may be sealed by actuating a control (e.g., a foot pedal) to reduce the voltage of the power supply into the coagulation mode. In this mode, the active electrodes may be pressed against the severed vessel to provide sealing and/or coagulation of the vessel. Alternatively, a coagulation electrode located on the same or a different probe may be pressed against the severed vessel. Once the vessel is adequately sealed or coagulated, the surgeon may activate a control (e.g., another foot pedal) to increase the voltage of the power supply back into the ablation mode. According to another aspect of the invention, larger vessels may be clamped against the active electrode and coagulated prior to being severed via the cool ablation process of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The present invention is also useful for removing or ablating tissue around nerves, such as spinal, or cranial nerves, e.g., the hypoglossal nerve, the optic nerve, facial nerves, vestibulocochlear nerves and the like. This is particularly advantageous when removing tissue that is located close to nerves. One of the significant drawbacks with the conventional RF devices, scalpels, and lasers is that these devices do not differentiate between the target tissue and the surrounding nerves or bone. Therefore, the surgeon must be extremely careful during these procedures to avoid damage to the nerves within and around the target tissue. In the present invention, the Coblation® process for removing tissue results in no, or extremely small amounts, of collateral tissue damage, as described above. This allows the surgeon to remove tissue close to a nerve without causing collateral damage to the nerve fibers and surrounding tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition to the generally precise nature of the novel mechanisms of the present invention, applicant has discovered an additional method of ensuring that adjacent nerves are not damaged during tissue removal. According to the present invention, systems and methods are provided for distinguishing between the fatty tissue immediately surrounding nerve fibers and the normal tissue that is to be removed during the procedure. Peripheral nerves usually comprise a connective tissue sheath, or epineurium, enclosing the bundles of nerve fibers, each bundle being surrounded by its own sheath of connective tissue (the perineurium) to protect these nerve fibers. The outer protective tissue sheath or epineurium typically comprises a fatty tissue (e.g., adipose tissue) having substantially different electrical properties than the normal target tissue that is treated. The system of the present invention measures the electrical properties of the tissue at the tip of the probe with one or more active electrode(s). These electrical properties may include electrical conductivity at one, several, or a range of frequencies (e.g., in the range from 1 kHz to 100 MHz), dielectric constant, capacitance or combinations of these. In this embodiment, an audible signal may be produced when the sensing electrode(s) at the tip of the probe detects the fatty tissue surrounding a nerve, or direct feedback control can be provided to only supply power to the active electrode(s) either individually or to the complete array of electrodes, if and when the tissue encountered at the tip or working end of the probe is normal tissue based on the measured electrical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one embodiment, the current limiting elements are configured such that the active electrodes will shut down or turn off when the electrical impedance reaches a threshold level. When this threshold level is set to the impedance of the fatty tissue surrounding nerves, the active electrodes will shut off whenever they come in contact with, or in close proximity to, nerves. Meanwhile, the other active electrodes, which are in contact with or in close proximity to target tissue, will continue to conduct electric current to the return electrode. This selective ablation or removal of lower impedance tissue in combination with the Coblation® mechanism of the present invention allows the surgeon to precisely remove tissue around nerves or bone. Applicant has found that the present invention is capable of volumetrically removing tissue closely adjacent to nerves without impairing the function of the nerves, and without significantly damaging the tissue of the epineurium.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The present invention can be also be configured to create an incision in a bone of the patient. For example, the systems of the present invention can be used to create an incision in the sternum for access to the thoracic cavity. Applicant has found that the Coblation® mechanism of the present invention allows the surgeon to precisely create an incision in the sternum while minimizing or preventing bone bleeding. The high frequency voltage is applied between the active electrode(s) and the return electrode(s) to volumetrically remove the bone from a specific site targeted for the incision. As the active electrode(s) are passed through the incision in the bone, the sides of the active electrodes (or a third coagulation electrode) slidingly contact the bone surrounding the incision to provide hemostasis in the bone. A more complete description of such coagulation electrodes can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/162,117, filed Sep. 28, 1998, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The present invention can also be used to dissect and harvest blood vessels from the patient's body during a CABG procedure. The system of the present invention allows a surgeon to dissect and harvest blood vessels, such as the right or left IMA or saphenous vein, while concurrently providing hemostasis at the harvesting site. In some embodiments, a first high frequency voltage, can be delivered in an ablation mode to effect molecular disintegration of connective tissue adjacent to the blood vessel targeted for harvesting; and a second, lower voltage can be delivered to achieve hemostasis of the connective tissue adjacent to the blood vessel. In other embodiments, the targeted blood vessel can be transected at one or more positions along its length, and one or more coagulation electrode(s) can be used to seal the transected blood vessel at the site of transection. The coagulation electrode(s) may be configured such that a single voltage can be applied to the active electrodes to ablate the tissue and to coagulate the blood vessel and target site.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The present invention also provides systems, apparatus, and methods for selectively removing tumors or other undesirable body structures while minimizing the spread of viable cells from the tumor. Conventional techniques for removing such tumors generally result in the production of smoke in the surgical setting, termed an electrosurgical or laser plume, which can spread intact, viable bacterial or viral particles from the tumor or lesion to the surgical team, or viable cancerous cells to other locations within the patient's body. This potential spread of viable cells or particles has resulted in increased concerns over the proliferation of certain debilitating and fatal diseases, such as hepatitis, herpes, HIV and papillomavirus. In the present invention, high frequency voltage is applied between the active electrode(s) and one or more return electrode(s) to volumetrically remove at least a portion of the tissue cells in the tumor or lesion by the molecular dissociation of tissue components into non-condensable gases. The high frequency voltage is preferably selected to effect controlled removal of these tissue cells while minimizing substantial tissue necrosis to surrounding or underlying tissue. A more complete description of this phenomenon can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/109,219, filed Jun. 30, 1998, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A current flow path between the active electrode(s) and the return electrode(s) may be generated by submerging the tissue site in an electrically conductive fluid (e.g., within a viscous fluid, such as an electrically conductive gel) or by directing an electrically conductive fluid along a fluid path to the target site (i.e., a liquid, such as isotonic saline, or a gas, such as argon). This latter method is particularly effective in a dry field procedure (i.e., the tissue is not submersed in fluid). The use of a conductive gel allows a slower, more controlled delivery rate of conductive fluid as compared with a liquid or a gas. In addition, the viscous nature of the gel may allow the surgeon to more easily contain the gel around the target site (e.g., as compared with containment of isotonic saline). A more complete description of an exemplary method of directing electrically conductive fluid between the active and return electrodes is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,697,281, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the body's natural conductive fluids, such as blood, may be sufficient to establish a conductive path between the return electrode(s) and the active electrode(s), and to provide the conditions for establishing a vapor layer, as described above. However, conductive fluid that is introduced into the patient is generally preferred over blood because blood will tend to coagulate at certain temperatures. Advantageously, a liquid electrically conductive fluid (e.g., isotonic saline) may be used to concurrently “bathe” the target tissue surface to provide an additional means for removing any tissue, and to cool the tissue at or adjacent to the target site.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments of the invention, an electrosurgical probe includes an electrode support for electrically isolating the active electrode(s) from the return electrode, and a fluid delivery port or outlet for directing an electrically conductive fluid to the target site or to the distal end of the probe. The electrode support and the fluid outlet may be recessed from an outer surface of the instrument to confine the electrically conductive fluid to the region immediately surrounding the electrode support. In addition, a shaft of the instrument may be shaped so as to form a cavity around the electrode support and the fluid outlet. This helps to assure that the electrically conductive fluid will remain in contact with the active electrode(s) and the return electrode(s) to maintain the conductive path therebetween. In addition, this will help to maintain a vapor layer and subsequent plasma layer between the active electrode(s) and the tissue at the treatment site throughout the procedure, thereby reducing any thermal damage that might otherwise occur if the vapor layer were extinguished due to a lack of conductive fluid. Provision of the electrically conductive fluid around the target site also helps to maintain the tissue temperature at desired levels.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The electrically conductive fluid should have a threshold conductivity to provide a suitable conductive path between the return electrode and the active electrode(s). The electrical conductivity of the fluid (in units of milliSiemens per centimeter or mS/cm) will usually be greater than 0.2 mS/cm, preferably will be greater than 2 mS/cm and more preferably greater than 10 mS/cm. In an exemplary embodiment, the electrically conductive fluid is isotonic saline, which has a conductivity of about 17 mS/cm.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">An electrosurgical probe or instrument of the invention typically includes a shaft having a proximal end and a distal end, and one or more active electrode(s) disposed at the shaft distal end. The shaft serves to mechanically support the active electrode(s) and permits the treating physician to manipulate the shaft distal end via a handle attached to the proximal end of the shaft. The shaft may be rigid or flexible, with flexible shafts optionally being combined with a generally rigid external tube for mechanical support. Flexible shafts may be combined with pull wires, shape memory actuators, and other known mechanisms for effecting selective deflection of the distal end of the shaft to facilitate positioning of the electrode array. The shaft will usually have one or more wires, electrode connectors, leads, or other conductive elements running axially therethrough, to permit connection of the electrode(s) to a connection block located at the proximal end of the instrument. The connection block is adapted for coupling the electrode(s) to the power supply or controller. Typically, the connection block is housed within the handle of the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The shaft of an instrument under the invention may have a variety of different shapes and sizes. Generally, the shaft will have a suitable diameter and length to allow the surgeon to access the target site with the distal or working end of the shaft. Thus, the shaft may be provided in a range of sizes according to the particular procedure or tissue targeted for treatment. Typically, the shaft will have a length in the range of from about 5 cm to 30 cm, and have a diameter in the range of from about 0.5 mm to 10 mm. Specific shaft designs will be described in detail in connection with the drawings hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The present invention may use a single active electrode or a plurality of electrodes distributed across a contact surface of a probe (e.g., in a linear fashion). In the latter embodiment, the electrode array usually includes a plurality of independently current-limited and/or power-controlled active electrodes to apply electrical energy selectively to the target tissue while limiting the unwanted application of electrical energy to the surrounding tissue and environment resulting from power dissipation into surrounding electrically conductive liquids, such as blood, normal saline, electrically conductive gel and the like. The active electrodes may be independently current-limited by isolating the terminals from each other and connecting each terminal to a separate power source that is isolated from the other active electrodes. Alternatively, the active electrodes may be connected to each other at either the proximal or distal ends of the probe to form a single wire that couples to a power source.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one configuration, each individual active electrode is electrically insulated from all other active electrodes within the probe and is connected to a power source which is isolated from each of the other active electrodes in the array, or to circuitry which limits or interrupts current flow to the active electrode when low resistivity material (e.g., blood, electrically conductive saline irrigant or electrically conductive gel) causes a lower impedance path between the return electrode and the individual active electrode. The isolated power sources for each individual active electrode may be separate power supply circuits having internal impedance characteristics which limit power to the associated active electrode when a low impedance return path is encountered. By way of example, the isolated power source may be a user selectable constant current source. In this embodiment, lower impedance paths will automatically result in lower resistive heating levels since the heating is proportional to the square of the operating current times the impedance. Alternatively, a single power source may be connected to each of the active electrodes through independently actuatable switches, or by independent current limiting elements, such as inductors, capacitors, resistors and/or combinations thereof. The current limiting elements may be provided in the probe, connectors, cable, power supply or along the conductive path from the power supply to the distal tip of the probe. Alternatively, the resistance and/or capacitance may occur on the surface of the active electrode(s) due to oxide layers which form selected active electrodes (e.g., titanium or a resistive coating on the surface of metal, such as platinum).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The distal end of the probe may comprise many independent active electrodes designed to deliver electrical energy in the vicinity of the distal end. The selective application of electrical energy to the conductive fluid is achieved by connecting each individual active electrode and the return electrode to a power source having independently controlled or current limited channels. The return electrode(s) may comprise a single tubular member of electrically conductive material at the distal end of the probe proximal to the active electrode(s) The same tubular member of electrically conductive material may also serve as a conduit for the supply of the electrically conductive fluid between the active and return electrodes. The application of high frequency voltage between the return electrode(s) and the active electrode(s) results in the generation of high electric field intensities at the distal tip of the active electrode(s), with conduction of high frequency current from each active electrode to the return electrode. The current flow from each active electrode to the return electrode(s) is controlled by either active or passive means, or a combination thereof, to deliver electrical energy to the surrounding conductive fluid while minimizing energy delivery to surrounding (non-target) tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The application of a suitable high frequency voltage between the return electrode(s) and the active electrode(s) for appropriate time intervals effects cutting, removing, ablating, shaping, contracting or otherwise modifying the target tissue. In one embodiment, the tissue volume over which energy is dissipated (i.e., over which a high current density exists) may be precisely controlled, for example, by the use of a multiplicity of small active electrodes whose effective diameters or principal dimensions range from about 5 mm to 0.01 mm, preferably from about 2 mm to 0.05 mm, and more preferably from about 1 mm to 0.1 mm. Electrode areas for both circular and non-circular terminals will have a contact area (per active electrode) below 25 mm<sup>2</sup>, preferably being in the range from 0.0001 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 1 mm<sup>2</sup>, and more preferably from 0.005 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup>. The circumscribed area of the electrode array is in the range from 0.25 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 75 mm<sup>2</sup>, preferably from 0.5 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 40 mm<sup>2</sup>. In one embodiment the probe may include a plurality of relatively small active electrodes disposed over the distal contact surfaces on the shaft. The use of small diameter active electrodes increases the electric field intensity and reduces the extent or depth of tissue heating as a consequence of the divergence of current flux lines which emanate from the exposed surface of each active electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The portion of the electrode support on which the active electrode(s) are mounted generally defines a tissue treatment surface of the probe. The area of the tissue treatment surface can vary widely, and the tissue treatment surface can assume a variety of geometries, with particular areas and geometries being selected for specific applications. The area of the tissue treatment surface can range from about 0.25 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 75 mm<sup>2</sup>, usually being from about 0.5 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 40 mm<sup>2</sup>. The geometries of the active electrode(s) can be planar, concave, convex, hemispherical, conical, a linear “in-line” array, or virtually any other regular or irregular shape. Most commonly, the active electrode(s) will be located at the shaft distal end of the electrosurgical probe, frequently having planar, disk-shaped, or hemispherical surfaces for use in reshaping procedures, ablating, cutting, dissecting organs, coagulating, or transecting blood vessels. The active electrode(s) may be arranged terminally or laterally on the electrosurgical probe (e.g., in the manner of a scalpel or a blade). However, it should be clearly understood that the active electrode of the invention does not cut or sever tissue mechanically as for a scalpel blade, but rather by the localized molecular dissociation of tissue components due to application of high frequency electric current to the active electrode. In one embodiment, a distal portion of the shaft may be flattened or compressed laterally (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A-32C</figref>). A probe having a laterally compressed shaft may facilitate access to certain target sites or body structures during various surgical procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In embodiments having a plurality of active electrodes, it should be clearly understood that the invention is not limited to electrically isolated active electrodes. For example, a plurality of active electrodes may be connected to a single lead that extends through the probe shaft and is coupled to a high frequency power supply. Alternatively, the probe may incorporate a single electrode that extends directly through the probe shaft or is connected to a single lead that extends to the power source. The active electrode may have a planar or blade shape, a screwdriver or conical shape, a sharpened point, a ball shape (e.g., for tissue vaporization and desiccation), a twizzle shape (for vaporization and needle-like cutting), a spring shape (for rapid tissue debulking and desiccation), a twisted metal shape, an annular or solid tube shape, or the like. Alternatively, the electrode may comprise a plurality of filaments, a rigid or flexible brush electrode (for debulking a tumor, such as a fibroid, bladder tumor or a prostate adenoma), a side-effect brush electrode on a lateral surface of the shaft, a coiled electrode, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one embodiment, the probe comprises a single blade active electrode that extends from an insulating support member, spacer, or electrode support, e.g., a ceramic or silicone rubber spacer located at the distal end of the probe. The insulating support member may be a tubular structure or a laterally compressed structure that separates the blade active electrode from a tubular or annular return electrode positioned proximal to the insulating member and the active electrode. The blade electrode may include a distal cutting edge and sides which are configured to coagulate the tissue as the blade electrode advances through the tissue. In yet another embodiment, the catheter or probe includes a single active electrode that can be rotated relative to the rest of the catheter body, or the entire catheter may be rotated relative to the electrode lead(s). The single active electrode can be positioned adjacent the abnormal tissue and energized and rotated as appropriate to remove or modify the target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The active electrode(s) are preferably supported within or by an insulating support member positioned near the distal end of the instrument shaft. The return electrode may be located on the instrument shaft, on another instrument, or on the external surface of the patient (i.e., a dispersive pad). For certain procedures, the close proximity of nerves and other sensitive tissue makes a bipolar design more preferable because this minimizes the current flow through non-target tissue and surrounding nerves. Accordingly, the return electrode is preferably either integrated with the instrument body, or located on another instrument. The proximal end of the probe typically includes the appropriate electrical connections for coupling the return electrode(s) and the active electrode(s) to a high frequency power supply, such as an electrosurgical generator.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">One exemplary power supply of the present invention delivers a high frequency current selectable to generate average power levels ranging from several milliwatts to tens of watts per electrode, depending on the volume of target tissue being treated, and/or the maximum allowed temperature selected for the instrument tip. The power supply allows the user to select the voltage level according to the specific requirements of a particular otologic procedure, neurosurgery procedure, cardiac surgery, arthroscopic surgery, dermatological procedure, ophthalmic procedures, open surgery or other endoscopic surgery procedure. For cardiac procedures and potentially for neurosurgery, the power source may have an additional filter, for filtering leakage voltages at frequencies below 100 kHz, particularly voltages around 60 kHz. Alternatively, a power supply having a higher operating frequency, e.g., 300 kHz to 500 kHz may be used in certain procedures in which stray low frequency currents may be problematic. A description of one suitable power supply can be found in co-pending patent application Ser. Nos. 09/058,571 and 09/058,336, filed Apr. 10, 1998, the complete disclosure of both applications are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The voltage difference applied between the return electrode(s) and the active electrode(s) will be at high or radio frequency, typically between about 5 kHz and 20 MHz, usually being between about 30 kHz and 2.5 MHz, preferably being between about 50 kHz and 500 kHz, often less than 350 kHz, and often between about 100 kHz and 200 kHz. The RMS (root mean square) voltage applied will usually be in the range from about 5 volts to 1000 volts, preferably being in the range from about 10 volts to 500 volts depending on the active electrode size, the operating frequency, and the operation mode of the particular procedure or desired effect on the tissue (e.g., contraction, coagulation, cutting or ablation). Typically, the peak-to-peak voltage for ablation or cutting will be in the range of 10 volts to 2000 volts and preferably in the range of 200 volts to 1800 volts, and more preferably in the range of about 300 volts to 1500 volts, often in the range of about 500 volts to 900 volts peak to peak (again, depending on the electrode size, the operating frequency and the operation mode). Lower peak-to-peak voltages will be used for tissue coagulation or collagen contraction and will typically be in the range from 50 to 1500, preferably 100 to 1000, and more preferably 120 to 600 volts peak-to-peak.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The voltage is usually delivered in a series of voltage pulses or alternating current of time varying voltage amplitude with a sufficiently high frequency (e.g., on the order of 5 kHz to 20 MHz) such that the voltage is effectively applied continuously (as compared with e.g., lasers claiming small depths of necrosis, which are generally pulsed about 10 Hz to 20 Hz). In addition, the duty cycle (i.e., cumulative time in any one-second interval that energy is applied) is on the order of about 50% for the present invention, as compared with pulsed lasers which typically have a duty cycle of about 0.0001%.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The power supply may include a fluid interlock for interrupting power to the active electrode(s) when there is insufficient conductive fluid around the active electrode(s). This ensures that the instrument will not be activated when conductive fluid is not present, minimizing the tissue damage that may otherwise occur. A more complete description of such a fluid interlock can be found in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/058,336, filed Apr. 10, 1998, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The power supply may also be current limited or otherwise controlled so that undesired heating of the target tissue or surrounding (non-target) tissue does not occur. In a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, current limiting inductors are placed in series with each independent active electrode, where the inductance of the inductor is in the range of 10 uH to 50,000 uH, depending on the electrical properties of the target tissue, the desired tissue heating rate and the operating frequency. Alternatively, capacitor-inductor (LC) circuit structures may be employed, as described previously in U.S. Pat. No. 5,697,909, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, current limiting resistors may be selected. Preferably, these resistors will have a large positive temperature coefficient of resistance so that, as the current level begins to rise for any individual active electrode in contact with a low resistance medium (e.g., saline irrigant or blood), the resistance of the current limiting resistor increases significantly, thereby minimizing the power delivery from the active electrode into the low resistance medium (e.g., saline irrigant or blood).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some procedures, it may also be necessary to retrieve or aspirate the electrically conductive fluid and/or the non-condensable gaseous products of ablation. In addition, it may be desirable to aspirate small pieces of tissue or other body structures that are not completely disintegrated by the high frequency energy, or other fluids at the target site, such as blood, mucus, purulent fluid, the gaseous products of ablation, or the like. Accordingly, the system of the present invention may include one or more suction lumen(s) in the instrument, or on another instrument, coupled to a suitable vacuum source for aspirating fluids from the target site. In addition, the invention may include one or more aspiration electrode(s) coupled to the distal end of the suction lumen for ablating, or at least reducing the volume of, non-ablated tissue fragments that are aspirated into the lumen. The aspiration electrode(s) function mainly to inhibit clogging of the lumen that may otherwise occur as larger tissue fragments are drawn therein. The aspiration electrode(s) may be different from the ablation active electrode(s), or the same electrode(s) may serve both functions. A more complete description of instruments incorporating aspiration electrode(s) can be found in commonly assigned, co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/010,382, filed Jan. 21, 1998, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">During a surgical procedure, the distal end of the instrument and the active electrode(s) may be maintained at a small distance away from the target tissue surface. This small spacing allows for the continuous flow of electrically conductive fluid into the interface between the active electrode(s) and the target tissue surface. The continuous flow of the electrically conductive fluid helps to ensure that the thin vapor layer will remain between the active electrode(s) and the tissue surface. In addition, dynamic movement of the active electrode(s) over the tissue site allows the electrically conductive fluid to cool the tissue underlying and surrounding the target tissue to minimize thermal damage to this surrounding and underlying tissue. Accordingly, the electrically conductive fluid may be cooled to facilitate the cooling of the tissue. Typically, the active electrode(s) will be about 0.02 mm to 2 mm from the target tissue and preferably about 0.05 mm to 0.5 mm during the ablation process. One method of maintaining this space is to move, translate and/or rotate the probe transversely relative to the tissue, i.e., for the operator to use a light brushing motion, to maintain a thin vaporized layer or region between the active electrode and the tissue. Of course, if coagulation or collagen shrinkage of a deeper region of tissue is necessary (e.g., for sealing a bleeding vessel embedded within the tissue), it may be desirable to press the active electrode(s) against the tissue to effect joulean heating therein.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary electrosurgical system <b>11</b> for cutting, ablating, resecting, or otherwise modifying tissue will now be described in detail. Electrosurgical system <b>11</b> generally comprises an electrosurgical handpiece or probe <b>10</b> connected to a power supply <b>28</b> for providing high frequency voltage to a target site, and a fluid source <b>21</b> for supplying electrically conductive fluid <b>50</b> to probe <b>10</b>. In addition, electrosurgical system <b>11</b> may include an endoscope (not shown) with a fiber optic head light for viewing the surgical site. The endoscope may be integral with probe <b>10</b>, or it may be part of a separate instrument. The system <b>11</b> may also include a vacuum source (not shown) for coupling to a suction lumen or tube <b>211</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the probe <b>10</b> for aspirating the target site.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown, probe <b>10</b> generally includes a proximal handle <b>19</b> and an elongate shaft <b>18</b> having one or more active electrodes <b>58</b> at its distal end. A connecting cable <b>34</b> has a connector <b>26</b> for electrically coupling the active electrodes <b>58</b> to power supply <b>28</b>. In embodiments having a plurality of active electrodes, active electrodes <b>58</b> are electrically isolated from each other and the terminal of each active electrode <b>58</b> is connected to an active or passive control network within power supply <b>28</b> by means of a plurality of individually insulated conductors (not shown). A fluid supply tube <b>15</b> is connected to a fluid tube <b>14</b> of probe <b>10</b> for supplying electrically conductive fluid <b>50</b> to the target site.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Power supply <b>28</b> has an operator controllable voltage level adjustment <b>30</b> to change the applied voltage level, which is observable at a voltage level display <b>32</b>. Power supply <b>28</b> also includes first, second, and third foot pedals <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and a cable <b>36</b> which is removably coupled to power supply <b>28</b>. The foot pedals <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> allow the surgeon to remotely adjust the energy level applied to active electrode(s) <b>58</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, first foot pedal <b>37</b> is used to place the power supply into the “ablation” mode and second foot pedal <b>38</b> places power supply <b>28</b> into the “coagulation” mode. The third foot pedal <b>39</b> allows the user to adjust the voltage level within the ablation mode. In the ablation mode, a sufficient voltage is applied to the active electrodes to establish the requisite conditions for molecular dissociation of the tissue (i.e., vaporizing a portion of the electrically conductive fluid, ionizing the vapor layer and accelerating charged particles against the tissue). As discussed above, the requisite voltage level for ablation will vary depending on the number, size, shape and spacing of the electrodes, the distance in which the electrodes extend from the support member, etc. When the surgeon is using the power supply in the ablation mode, voltage level adjustment <b>30</b> or third foot pedal <b>39</b> may be used to adjust the voltage level to adjust the degree or aggressiveness of the ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Of course, it will be recognized that the voltage and modality of the power supply may be controlled by other input devices. However, applicant has found that foot pedals are convenient means for controlling the power supply while manipulating the probe during a surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the coagulation mode, the power supply <b>28</b> applies a low enough voltage to the active electrode(s) (or the coagulation electrode) to avoid vaporization of the electrically conductive fluid and subsequent molecular dissociation of the tissue. The surgeon may automatically toggle the power supply between the ablation and coagulation modes by alternately stepping on foot pedals <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, respectively. This allows the surgeon to quickly move between coagulation and ablation in situ, without having to remove his/her concentration from the surgical field or without having to request an assistant to switch the power supply. By way of example, as the surgeon is sculpting soft tissue in the ablation mode, the probe typically will simultaneously seal and/or coagulate small severed vessels within the tissue. However, larger vessels, or vessels with high fluid pressures (e.g., arterial vessels) may not be sealed in the ablation mode. Accordingly, the surgeon can simply step on foot pedal <b>38</b>, automatically lowering the voltage level below the threshold level for ablation, and apply sufficient pressure onto the severed vessel for a sufficient period of time to seal and/or coagulate the vessel. After this is completed, the surgeon may quickly move back into the ablation mode by stepping on foot pedal <b>37</b>.

<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an electrosurgical probe <b>20</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. Probe <b>20</b> may be used in conjunction with a system similar or analogous to system <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, probe <b>20</b> generally includes an elongated shaft <b>100</b> which may be flexible or rigid, a handle <b>204</b> coupled to the proximal end of shaft <b>100</b> and an electrode support member <b>102</b> coupled to the distal end of shaft <b>100</b>. Shaft <b>100</b> may comprise a plastic material that is easily molded into the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or shaft <b>100</b> may comprise an electrically conductive material, usually a metal, such as tungsten, stainless steel alloys, platinum or its alloys, titanium or its alloys, molybdenum or its alloys, and nickel or its alloys. In the latter case (i.e., shaft <b>100</b> is electrically conductive), probe <b>20</b> includes an electrically insulating jacket <b>108</b>, which is typically formed as one or more electrically insulating sheaths or coatings, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide, and the like. The provision of electrically insulating jacket <b>108</b> over shaft <b>100</b> prevents direct electrical contact between the metal shaft and any adjacent body structure or the surgeon. Such direct electrical contact between a body structure (e.g., heart, bone, nerves, skin, or other blood vessels) and an exposed electrode could result in unwanted heating and necrosis of the structure at the point of contact.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Handle <b>204</b> typically comprises a plastic material that is easily molded into a suitable shape for handling by the surgeon. Handle <b>204</b> defines an inner cavity (not shown) that houses an electrical connections unit <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and provides a suitable interface for coupling probe <b>20</b> to power supply <b>28</b> via an electrical connecting cable. Electrode support member <b>102</b> extends from the distal end of shaft <b>100</b> (usually about 1 mm to 20 mm), and provides support for an active electrode or a plurality of electrically isolated active electrodes <b>104</b>. In the specific configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, probe <b>20</b> includes a plurality of active electrodes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a fluid tube <b>233</b> extends through an opening in handle <b>204</b>, and includes a connector <b>235</b> for connection to a fluid supply source for supplying electrically conductive fluid to the target site. Fluid tube <b>233</b> is coupled to a distal fluid tube <b>239</b> that extends along the outer surface of shaft <b>100</b> to an opening <b>237</b> at the distal end of the probe <b>20</b>, as will be discussed in detail below. Of course, the invention is not limited to this configuration. For example, fluid tube <b>233</b> may extend through a single lumen (not shown) in shaft <b>100</b>, it may be coupled to a plurality of lumens (also not shown) that extend through shaft <b>100</b> to a plurality of openings at its distal end, or the fluid tube may be completely independent of shaft <b>100</b>. Probe <b>20</b> may also include a valve or equivalent structure for controlling the flow rate of the electrically conductive fluid to the target site.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, electrode support member <b>102</b> has a substantially planar tissue treatment surface <b>212</b> and comprises a suitable insulating material (e.g., a ceramic or glass material, such as alumina, zirconia and the like) which could be formed at the time of manufacture in a flat, hemispherical or other shape according to the requirements of a particular procedure. The preferred support member material is alumina (Kyocera Industrial Ceramics Corporation, Elkgrove, Ill.), because of its high thermal conductivity, good electrically insulative properties, high flexural modulus, resistance to carbon tracking, biocompatibility, and high melting point. Electrode support member <b>102</b> is adhesively joined to a tubular support member (not shown) that extends most or all of the distance between support member <b>102</b> and the proximal end of probe <b>20</b>. The tubular member preferably comprises an electrically insulating material, such as an epoxy or silicone-based material.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In a preferred construction technique, active electrodes <b>104</b> extend through pre-formed openings in the support member <b>102</b> so that they protrude above tissue treatment surface <b>212</b> by the desired distance. The electrodes are then bonded to the tissue treatment surface <b>212</b> of support member <b>102</b>, typically by an inorganic sealing material. The sealing material is selected to provide effective electrical insulation, and good adhesion to both support member <b>102</b> and active electrodes <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, active electrodes <b>104</b> comprise an electrically conducting, corrosion resistant metal, such as platinum or titanium. The sealing material additionally should have a compatible thermal expansion coefficient and a melting point well below that of platinum or titanium and alumina or zirconia, typically being a glass or glass ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, probe <b>20</b> includes a return electrode <b>112</b> for completing the current path between active electrodes <b>104</b> and a high frequency power supply <b>28</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As shown, return electrode <b>112</b> preferably comprises an annular conductive band coupled to the distal end of shaft <b>100</b> at a location proximal to tissue treatment surface <b>212</b> of electrode support member <b>102</b>, typically about 0.5 mm to 10 mm proximal to surface <b>212</b>, and more preferably about 1 mm to 10 mm proximal to surface <b>212</b>. Return electrode <b>112</b> is coupled to a connector <b>258</b> that extends to the proximal end of probe <b>20</b>, where it is suitably connected to power supply <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, return electrode <b>112</b> is not directly connected to active electrodes <b>104</b>. To complete this current path so that active electrodes <b>104</b> are electrically connected to return electrode <b>112</b>, electrically conductive fluid (e.g., isotonic saline) is caused to flow therebetween. In the representative embodiment, the electrically conductive fluid is delivered through an external fluid tube <b>239</b> to opening <b>237</b>, as described above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>). Alternatively, the fluid may be continuously delivered by a fluid delivery element (not shown) that is separate from probe <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In alternative embodiments, the fluid path may be formed in probe <b>20</b> by, for example, an inner lumen or an annular gap between the return electrode and a tubular support member within shaft <b>100</b> (not shown). This annular gap may be formed near the perimeter of the shaft <b>100</b> such that the electrically conductive fluid tends to flow radially inward towards the target site, or it may be formed towards the center of shaft <b>100</b> so that the fluid flows radially outward. In both of these embodiments, a fluid source (e.g., a bag of fluid elevated above the surgical site or having a pumping device), is coupled to probe <b>20</b> via a fluid supply tube (not shown) that may or may not have a controllable valve. A more complete description of an electrosurgical probe incorporating one or more fluid lumen(s) can be found in U.S. Pat.

The tissue treatment surface and individual active electrodes <b>104</b> will usually have dimensions within the ranges set forth above. Active electrodes <b>104</b> preferably have a distal edge <b>107</b> to increase the electric field intensities around terminals <b>104</b>, and to facilitate cutting of tissue. Thus, active electrodes <b>104</b> have a screwdriver shape in the representative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. In one representative embodiment, the tissue treatment surface <b>212</b> has a circular cross-sectional shape with a diameter in the range of about 1 mm to 30 mm, usually about 2 mm to 20 mm. The individual active electrodes <b>104</b> preferably extend outward from tissue treatment surface <b>212</b> by a distance of about 0.1 mm to 8 mm, usually about 1 mm to 4 mm. Applicant has found that this configuration increases the high electric field intensities and associated current densities around active electrodes <b>104</b> to facilitate the ablation of tissue as described in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Probe <b>20</b> may include a suction or aspiration lumen <b>213</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) within shaft <b>100</b> and a suction tube <b>211</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for aspirating tissue, fluids and/or gases from the target site. In this embodiment, the electrically conductive fluid generally flows from opening <b>237</b> of fluid tube <b>239</b> radially inward and then back through one or more openings (not shown) in support member <b>102</b>. Aspirating the electrically conductive fluid during surgery allows the surgeon to see the target site, and it prevents the fluid from flowing into the patient's body (e.g., the thoracic cavity). This aspiration should be controlled, however, so that the conductive fluid maintains a conductive path between the active electrode(s) and the return electrode. In some embodiments, the probe <b>20</b> will also include one or more aspiration electrode(s) (not shown) coupled to the aspiration lumen for inhibiting clogging during aspiration of tissue fragments from the surgical site.

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">According to the present invention, probe <b>20</b> further includes an identification element that is characteristic of the particular electrode assembly so that the same power supply <b>28</b> can be used for different electrosurgical operations. In one embodiment, for example, probe <b>20</b> includes a voltage reduction element or a voltage reduction circuit for reducing the voltage applied between the active electrodes <b>104</b> and the return electrode <b>112</b>. The voltage reduction element serves to reduce the voltage applied by the power supply so that the voltage between the active electrodes and the return electrode is low enough to avoid excessive power dissipation into the electrically conductive medium and/or the tissue at the target site. The voltage reduction element primarily allows the electrosurgical probe <b>10</b>/<b>20</b> to be compatible with a range of different power supplies that are adapted to apply higher voltages for ablation or vaporization of tissue (e.g., various power supplies or generators manufactured by ArthroCare Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif.). For contraction of tissue, for example, the voltage reduction element will serve to reduce a voltage of about 100 to 135 volts RMS (which corresponds to a setting of 1 on the ArthroCare Model 970 and 980 (i.e., 2000) Generators) to about 45 to 60 volts RMS, which is a suitable voltage for contraction of tissue without ablation (e.g., molecular dissociation) of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, n the representative embodiment the voltage reduction element is a dropping capacitor <b>262</b> which has a first leg <b>264</b> coupled to the return electrode wire <b>258</b> and a second leg <b>266</b> coupled to connector block <b>256</b>. Of course, the capacitor may be located in other places within the system, such as in, or distributed along the length of, the cable, the power supply, the connector, etc. In addition, it will be recognized that other voltage reduction elements, such as diodes, transistors, inductors, resistors, capacitors or combinations thereof, may be used in conjunction with the present invention. For example, probe <b>20</b> may include a coded resistor (not shown) that is constructed to lower the voltage applied between return electrode <b>112</b> and active electrodes <b>104</b> to a suitable level for contraction of tissue. In addition, electrical circuits may be employed for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Alternatively or additionally, the cable <b>22</b> that couples the power supply <b>28</b> to probe <b>10</b>/<b>20</b> may be used as a voltage reduction element. The cable has an inherent capacitance that can be used to reduce the power supply voltage if the cable is placed into the electrical circuit between the power supply, the active electrodes and the return electrode. In this embodiment, the cable <b>22</b> may be used alone, or in combination with one of the voltage reduction elements discussed above, e.g., a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, it should be noted that various electrosurgical probes of the present invention can be used with a particular power supply that is adapted to apply a voltage within a selected range for a certain procedure or treatment. In which case, a voltage reduction element or circuitry may not be necessary nor desired.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, electrode support member <b>70</b> according to one embodiment includes a multi-layer substrate comprising a suitable high temperature, electrically insulating material, such as ceramic. The multi-layer substrate is a thin or thick-film hybrid having conductive strips that are adhered to the ceramic wafer layers (e.g., thick-film printed and fired onto or plated onto the ceramic wafers). The conductive strips typically comprise tungsten, gold, nickel, silver, platinum or equivalent materials. In the exemplary embodiment, the conductive strips comprise tungsten, and they are co-fired together with the wafer layers to form an integral package. The conductive strips are coupled to external wire connectors by holes or vias that are drilled through the ceramic layers, and plated or otherwise covered with conductive material. A more complete description of such support members <b>370</b> can be found in U.S. patent application Ser.

As shown, all three vias <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> extend through wafer layer <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, a second wafer layer <b>202</b> is bonded between first outer wafer layer <b>200</b> and a middle wafer layer <b>204</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>). As shown, first active electrode <b>210</b><i>a </i>is attached to the distal surface of second wafer layer <b>202</b>, and a conductive strip <b>240</b> extends to via <b>230</b> to couple active electrode <b>210</b><i>a </i>to a lead wire.

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Of course, it will be recognized that a variety of different types of single layer and multi-layer wafers may be constructed according to the present invention. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment of the multi-layer ceramic wafer, wherein the active electrodes comprise planar strips <b>280</b> that are plated or otherwise bonded between the ceramic wafer layers <b>282</b>. Each of the planar strips <b>280</b> has a different length, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, so that the active electrodes can be electrically isolated from each other, and coupled to lead wires by vias (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates an electrosurgical probe <b>20</b>′ according to another embodiment of the present invention. Probe <b>20</b>′ generally includes handle <b>104</b> attached to shaft <b>100</b>, and has a single, thin, elongated active blade electrode <b>58</b>. Active electrode <b>58</b> is mechanically and electrically separated from return electrode <b>112</b> by a support structure <b>102</b>. The active blade electrode <b>58</b> has a sharp distal edge <b>59</b> which helps facilitate the cutting process, and sides <b>62</b> which contact the tissue (e.g., bone) as the blade electrode <b>58</b> passes through the tissue or body structure. By contacting the sides of the blade electrode <b>58</b> directly with the tissue or body structure, the electrical power supplied to electrode <b>58</b> by power supply <b>28</b> can provide hemostasis to the body structure during the cutting process. Optionally, probe <b>20</b>′ can further include one or more coagulation electrode(s) (not shown) configured to seal a severed vessel, bone, or other tissue that is being incised. Such coagulation electrode(s) may be configured such that a single voltage can be applied to coagulate with the coagulation electrode(s) while ablating tissue with the active electrode(s). According to one aspect of the invention, probe <b>20</b>′ is particularly useful for creating an incision in a patient's chest. For example, in an open-chest CABG procedure a median sternotomy is first performed in which the sternum is sectioned longitudinally so as to allow the chest to be opened for access to the thoracic cavity. Active electrodes <b>58</b> include distal edge <b>59</b> suitable for sectioning the sternum, and sides <b>62</b> suitable for arresting bone bleeding within the incised sternum. Sides <b>62</b> are configured to slidably engage the sternum as active electrode <b>58</b> is moved with respect to the sternum. Return electrode <b>112</b> is spaced proximally from active electrode <b>58</b> such that the electrical current is drawn away from the surrounding tissue. Alternatively, the return electrode <b>112</b> may be a dispersive pad located on the external surface of the patient's body. By minimizing bleeding of the sternum during an open-chest procedure, the patient's recovery time can be substantially shortened and patient suffering is alleviated.</p>

In one embodiment, the support material is alumina, available from Kyocera Industrial Ceramics Corporation, Elkgrove, Ill., because of its high thermal conductivity, good electrically insulative properties, high flexural modulus, resistance to carbon tracking, biocompatibility, and high melting point. The support <b>102</b> is adhesively joined to a tubular support member <b>78</b> that extends most or all of the distance between matrix <b>102</b> and the proximal end of probe <b>90</b>. Tubular member <b>78</b> preferably comprises an electrically insulating material, such as an epoxy or silicone-based material.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">According to one construction technique, active electrodes <b>104</b> extend through pre-formed openings in the support <b>102</b> so that they protrude above tissue treatment surface <b>212</b> by the desired distance.

Sealing material <b>80</b> is selected to provide effective electrical insulation, and good adhesion to both the support <b>102</b> and the platinum or titanium active electrodes. Sealing material <b>80</b> additionally should have a compatible thermal expansion coefficient, and a melting point well below that of platinum or titanium and alumina or zirconia, typically being a glass or glass ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, return electrode <b>112</b> comprises an annular member positioned around the exterior of shaft <b>100</b> of probe <b>90</b>.

Gap <b>54</b> preferably has a width in the range of 0.25 mm to 4 mm. Alternatively, probe <b>90</b> may include a plurality of longitudinal ribs between tubular member <b>78</b> and return electrode <b>112</b> to form a plurality of fluid lumens extending along the perimeter of shaft <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, the plurality of lumens will extend to a plurality of openings.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Return electrode <b>112</b> is disposed within an electrically insulative jacket <b>17</b>, which is typically formed as one or more electrically insulative sheaths or coatings, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide, and the like. The provision of the electrically insulative jacket <b>17</b> over return electrode <b>112</b> prevents direct electrical contact between return electrode <b>112</b> and any adjacent body structure. Such direct electrical contact between a body structure (e.g., the heart) and an exposed electrode member <b>112</b> could result in unwanted heating and necrosis of the structure at the point of contact.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, return electrode <b>112</b> is not directly connected to active electrodes <b>104</b>.

When a voltage difference is applied between active electrodes <b>104</b> and return electrode <b>112</b>, high electric field intensities will be generated at the distal tips of active electrodes <b>104</b> with current flow from electrodes <b>104</b> through the target tissue to the return electrode, the high electric field intensities causing ablation of tissue <b>52</b> in zone <b>88</b>.</p>

In this embodiment, return electrode <b>112</b> is mounted to the outer surface of shaft <b>100</b> and is covered with an electrically insulating jacket <b>17</b>. The electrically conductive fluid <b>50</b> flows along flow path <b>83</b> through return electrode <b>112</b> and exits the distal end of electrode <b>112</b> at a point proximal of tissue treatment surface <b>212</b>.

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The present invention is not limited to an electrode array disposed on a relatively planar surface at the distal tip of probe <b>90</b>, as described above.

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-27C</figref>, tip <b>313</b> further includes a proximal hub <b>506</b> for supporting a male electrical connector <b>508</b> that holds a plurality of wires <b>510</b> each coupled to one of the active electrodes <b>358</b> or to return electrode <b>400</b> on support member <b>370</b>. A female connector <b>520</b> housed within handle <b>312</b> is removably coupled to male connector <b>508</b>, and a plurality of wires <b>522</b> extend from female connector <b>520</b> through a strain relief <b>524</b> to cable <b>334</b>. Both sets of wires <b>510</b>, <b>522</b> are insulated to prevent shorting in the event of fluid ingress into the probe <b>310</b>. This design allows for removable connection of the electrodes in tip <b>313</b> with the connector <b>520</b> within handle <b>312</b> so that the handle can be re-used with different tips <b>313</b>. Probe <b>310</b> will preferably also include an identification element, such as a coded resistor (not shown), for programming a particular voltage output range and mode of operation for the power supply. This allows the power supply to be employed with a variety of different probes for a variety of different applications.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the representative embodiment, probe <b>310</b> includes a fluid tube <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) for delivering electrically conductive fluid to the target site. Fluid tube <b>410</b> is sized to extend through a groove <b>414</b> in handle <b>313</b> and through an inner cavity <b>412</b> in tip <b>312</b> to a distal opening <b>414</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) located adjacent electrode support member <b>370</b>. Tube <b>410</b> extends all the way through inner cavity <b>412</b> to opening <b>414</b> to eliminate any possible fluid ingress into cavity <b>412</b>. Fluid tube <b>410</b> includes a proximal connector for coupling to an electrically conductive fluid source <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Probe <b>310</b> will also include a valve or equivalent structure for controlling the flow rate of the electrically conductive fluid to the target site. In the representative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-27C</figref>, handle <b>312</b> comprises a main body <b>422</b> coupled between distal hub <b>418</b> and strain relief <b>420</b>, and a rotatable sleeve <b>416</b> around main body <b>422</b>. Distal hub <b>418</b> has an opening <b>419</b> for receiving proximal hub <b>506</b> of tip <b>313</b> for removably coupling the tip <b>313</b> to the handle <b>312</b>. Sleeve <b>416</b> is rotatably coupled to strain relief <b>420</b> and distal hub <b>418</b> to provide a valve structure for fluid tube <b>410</b>.

Rotation of sleeve <b>416</b> will impede, and eventually obstruct, the flow of fluid through tube <b>410</b>. Of course, this fluid control may be provided by a variety of other input and valve devices, such as switches, buttons, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In alternative embodiments, the fluid path may be directly formed in probe <b>310</b> by, for example, a central inner lumen or an annular gap (not shown) within the handle and the tip. This inner lumen may be formed near the perimeter of the probe <b>310</b> such that the electrically conductive fluid tends to flow radially inward towards the target site, or it may be formed towards the center of probe <b>310</b> so that the fluid flows radially outward. In addition, the electrically conductive fluid may be delivered from a fluid delivery element (not shown) that is separate from probe <b>310</b>. In arthroscopic surgery, for example, the body cavity will be flooded with isotonic saline and the probe <b>310</b> will be introduced into this flooded cavity. Electrically conductive fluid will be continually resupplied to maintain the conduction path between return electrode <b>400</b> and active electrodes <b>358</b>. A more complete description of alternative electrosurgical probes incorporating one or more fluid lumen(s) can be found in commonly assigned, co-pending application Ser. No. 08/485,219, filed on Jun. 7, 1995, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, electrically isolated active electrodes <b>358</b> are spaced apart over tissue treatment surface <b>380</b> of electrode support member <b>370</b>, preferably in a linear array. In the representative embodiment, three active electrodes <b>358</b>, each having a substantially conical shape, are arranged in a linear array extending distally from surface <b>380</b>. Active electrodes <b>358</b> will usually extend a distance of about 0.5 mm to 20 mm from tissue treatment surface <b>380</b>, preferably about 1 mm to 5 mm. Applicant has found that this configuration increases the electric field intensities and associated current densities at the distal edges of active electrodes <b>358</b>, which increases the rate of tissue cutting. In the representative embodiment, the tissue treatment surface <b>380</b> has a circular cross-sectional shape with a diameter in the range of about 0.5 mm to 20 mm (preferably about 2 mm to 10 mm). The individual active electrodes <b>358</b> preferably taper outward as shown, or they may form a distal edge, such as the electrodes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Probe <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> includes a shaft <b>432</b> coupled to a proximal handle <b>434</b> for holding and controlling shaft <b>432</b>. Probe <b>430</b> includes an active electrode array <b>436</b> at the distal tip of shaft <b>432</b>, an annular return electrode <b>438</b> extending through shaft <b>432</b> and proximally recessed from the active electrode array <b>436</b>, and an annular lumen <b>442</b> between return electrode <b>438</b> and an outer insulating sheath <b>446</b>. Probe <b>430</b> further includes a liquid supply conduit <b>444</b> attached to handle <b>434</b> and in fluid communication with lumen <b>442</b>, and a source of electrically conductive fluid (not shown) for delivering the fluid past return electrode <b>438</b> to the target site on the tissue <b>440</b>. Electrode array <b>436</b> is preferably flush with the distal end of shaft <b>432</b> or distally extended from the distal end by a small distance (on the order of 0.005 inches) so as to minimize the depth of ablation. Preferably, the distal end of shaft <b>432</b> is beveled to improve access and control of probe <b>430</b> while treating the target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Yet another embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. Auxiliary active electrodes <b>458</b>, <b>459</b> are positioned at the distal tip <b>70</b> of the probe. Auxiliary active electrodes <b>458</b>, <b>459</b> may be the same size as ablation active electrodes <b>58</b>, or larger as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. One operating arrangement is to connect auxiliary active electrodes <b>458</b>, <b>459</b> to two poles of a high frequency power supply to form a bipolar circuit allowing current to flow between the terminals of auxiliary active electrodes <b>458</b>, <b>459</b> as shown by current flux lines <b>460</b>. Auxiliary active electrodes <b>458</b>, <b>459</b> are electrically isolated from ablation electrodes <b>58</b>. By proper selection of the inter-electrode spacing, W<sub>2</sub>, and electrode width, W<sub>3</sub>, and the frequency of the applied voltage, the current flux lines <b>460</b> can be caused to flow below the target layer as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The voltage will preferably be sufficient to establish high electric field intensities between the active electrode array <b>436</b> and the target tissue <b>440</b> to thereby induce molecular breakdown or disintegration of several cell layers of the target tissue. As described above, a sufficient voltage will be applied to develop a thin layer of vapor within the electrically conductive fluid and to ionize the vaporized layer or region between the active electrode(s) and the target tissue. Energy in the form of charged particles are discharged from the vapor layer to ablate the target tissue, thereby minimizing necrosis of surrounding tissue and underlying cell layers.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, there is shown in perspective view an electrosurgical probe <b>700</b>, according to another embodiment of the invention. Probe <b>700</b> includes a shaft <b>702</b> having a shaft distal end portion <b>702</b><i>a </i>and a shaft proximal end portion <b>702</b><i>b</i>. Shaft <b>702</b> is affixed at its proximal end <b>702</b><i>b </i>to a handle <b>704</b>. Shaft <b>702</b> typically comprises an electrically conductive material, usually a metal, such as tungsten, stainless steel, platinum or its alloys, titanium or its alloys, molybdenum or its alloys, nickel or its alloys. An electrically insulating electrode support <b>710</b> is disposed at shaft distal end <b>702</b><i>a</i>. An active electrode <b>712</b> is disposed on electrode support <b>710</b>. Active electrode <b>712</b> comprises a blade electrode (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A</figref>, <b>31</b>B). An electrically insulating sleeve <b>716</b> covers a portion of shaft <b>702</b>, and terminates at sleeve distal end <b>716</b><i>a </i>to define an exposed portion of shaft <b>702</b> extending between electrode support proximal end <b>710</b><i>b </i>and sleeve distal end <b>716</b><i>a</i>. This exposed portion of shaft <b>702</b> defines a return electrode <b>718</b> on shaft distal end portion <b>702</b><i>a</i>. (In an alternative embodiment, the return electrode may take the form of an annular band of an electrically conductive material, e.g., a platinum alloy, disposed on the exterior of the shaft distal end.) A cavity within handle <b>704</b> accommodates a connection block <b>706</b>, which is connected to active electrode <b>712</b> and return electrode <b>718</b> via electrode leads (not shown). Connection block <b>706</b> provides a convenient mechanism for coupling active electrode <b>712</b> and return electrode <b>718</b> to opposite poles of a power supply (e.g., power supply <b>28</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref> is a perspective view of an active electrode <b>712</b> of probe <b>700</b>, according to one embodiment of the invention. Active electrode <b>712</b> is in the form of a single blade electrode which extends from electrode support <b>710</b> to a distance, H<sub>b</sub>. The distance H<sub>b </sub>may vary, for example, according to the intended applications of probe <b>700</b>, and the value of H<sub>b </sub>is at least to some extent a matter of design choice. Typically, for a broad array of electrosurgical procedures, the distance H<sub>b </sub>is in the range of from about 0.02 mm to about 5 mm. Active electrode <b>712</b> includes an active edge <b>713</b> which is adapted for generating high current densities thereat upon application of a high frequency voltage from the power supply between active electrode <b>712</b> and return electrode <b>718</b>. In this way, active edge <b>713</b> can efficiently effect localized ablation of tissues via molecular dissociation of tissue components which contact, or are in close proximity to, active edge <b>713</b>. A process for ablation of tissues via molecular dissociation of tissue components has been described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, the blade-like active electrode <b>712</b> further includes first and second blade sides, <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b</i>, respectively. First and second blade sides <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b </i>are separated by a maximum distance, W<sub>b</sub>. The distance W<sub>b </sub>is typically in the range of from about 0.1 mm to about 2.5 mm. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, first and second blade sides <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b </i>are substantially parallel to each other. Each of first and second blade sides <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b </i>are adapted for engaging tissue severed, ablated, or otherwise modified by active edge <b>713</b>, and for coagulating tissue engaged by first blade side <b>714</b><i>a </i>and/or second blade side <b>714</b><i>b</i>. In this way, active electrode <b>712</b> can precisely and effectively sever, ablate, or otherwise modify a target tissue with active edge <b>713</b> to form a first-modified tissue, and at the same time, or shortly thereafter, further modify the first-modified tissue by means of first and second blade sides <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b</i>. For example, active edge <b>713</b> can make an incision in a target tissue via localized molecular dissociation of target tissue components, while first and second blade sides <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b </i>can effect hemostasis in the severed tissue.</p>

<p id="p-0189" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A-B</figref> schematically represent a process during treatment of a patient with electrosurgical probe <b>700</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, active edge <b>713</b> forms an incision, I, in a target tissue, T, via localized molecular dissociation of tissue components upon application of a high frequency voltage between active electrode <b>712</b> and return electrode <b>718</b>. (The localized molecular dissociation may be facilitated by the delivery of a suitable quantity of an electrically conductive fluid (e.g. isotonic saline) to form a current flow path between active electrode <b>712</b> and return electrode <b>718</b>.) With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>, as the incision I is deepened within tissue T, first and second blade sides, <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b </i>engage severed tissue in regions indicated by the arrows labeled E. In this way, the severed tissue is coagulated by first and second blade sides, <b>714</b><i>a</i>, <b>714</b><i>b</i>, thereby effecting hemostasis at the point of incision of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref> schematically represents a number of steps involved in a method of treating a patient with an electrosurgical probe, wherein step <b>1000</b> involves positioning the distal end of the probe adjacent to target tissue such that an active electrode of the probe is in contact with or in close proximity to the target tissue. In one embodiment, the active electrode is spaced a short distance from the target tissue, as described hereinabove. Typically, step <b>1000</b> involves positioning the probe such that an active edge of the active electrode makes contact with, or is in close proximity to, the target tissue. Step <b>1002</b> involves delivering an electrically conductive fluid to the distal end of the probe in the vicinity of the active electrode and the return electrode, such that the electrically conductive fluid forms a current flow path between the active electrode and the return electrode. The electrically conductive fluid may be delivered via an exterior tube disposed on the outside of the shaft (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A</figref>, <b>37</b>B), or an outer sheath external to the shaft and forming an annular fluid delivery lumen (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A</figref>, <b>38</b>B). The electrically conductive fluid may be a liquid, a gel, or a gas. Apart from providing an efficient current flow path between the active and return electrodes, a clear, colorless electrically conductive liquid, such as isotonic saline, exhibits the added advantage of increasing the visibility of the surgeon at the target site. However, in situations where there is an abundance of electrically conductive body fluids (e.g., blood, synovial fluid) already present at the target site, step <b>1002</b> may optionally be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Step <b>1004</b> involves applying a high frequency voltage between the active electrode and the return electrode sufficient to ablate or otherwise modify the target tissue via localized molecular dissociation of target tissue components. By delivering an appropriate high frequency voltage to a suitably configured probe, the target tissue can be incised, dissected, transected, contracted, or otherwise modified. In addition, the modified tissue can also be coagulated (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>). The frequency of the applied voltage will generally be within the ranges cited hereinabove. For example, the frequency will typically range from about 5 kHz to 20 MHz, usually from about 30 kHz to 2.5 MHz, and often between about 100 kHz and 200 kHz. The root mean square (RMS) voltage that is applied in step <b>1004</b> is generally in the range of from about 5 volts RMS to 1000 volts RMS, more typically being in the range of from about 10 volts RMS to 500 volts RMS. The actual voltage applied may depend on a number of factors, including the size of the active electrode, the operating frequency, and the particular procedure or desired type of modification of the tissue (incision, contraction, etc.), as described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Step <b>1006</b> involves manipulating the probe with respect to the tissue at the target site. For example, the probe may be manipulated such that an active edge of a blade or hook electrode reciprocates with respect to the target tissue, such that the target tissue is severed, incised, or transected at the point of movement of the active edge by a process involving molecular dissociation of tissue components. In embodiments where the active electrode is in the form of a hook, step <b>1006</b> may involve engaging the hook against the target tissue and drawing the hook towards the operator in order to cut or sever the tissue. In this manner, the extent of cutting or severing can be precisely controlled. In one embodiment, step <b>1006</b> involves reciprocating an active edge in a direction parallel to a surface of the target tissue. Typically, step <b>1006</b> is performed concurrently with step <b>1004</b>. Step <b>1002</b> may be performed at any stage during the procedure, and the rate of delivery of the electrically conductive fluid may be regulated by a suitable mechanism, such as a valve.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Step <b>1008</b> involves modifying the target tissue as a result of the high frequency voltage applied in step <b>1004</b>. The target tissue may be modified in a variety of different ways, as referred to hereinabove. The type of tissue modification achieved depends, inter alia, on the voltage parameters of step <b>1004</b>; the shape, size, and composition of the active electrode; and the manner in which the probe is manipulated by the surgeon in step <b>1006</b>. At relatively high voltage levels, tissue components typically undergo localized molecular dissociation, whereby the target tissue can be dissected, incised, transected, etc. At a lower voltage, or at a lower current density on the active electrode surface, the target tissue can be contracted (e.g., by shrinkage of collagen fibers in the tissue), or a blood vessel can be coagulated. For example, in step <b>1010</b> the first and second blade sides of the active electrode may be engaged against a region of the target tissue which has been modified as a result of localized molecular dissociation of tissue components in step <b>1008</b>. The first and second blade sides are substantially flat metal plates having lower current densities than the active edge. In this manner, the lower current densities of the first and second blade sides effect further modification (e.g., coagulation) of the previously modified (e.g., severed) target tissue (step <b>1012</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref> schematically represents a number of steps involved in a method of severing tissue with an electrosurgical probe via a process involving molecular dissociation of tissue components, and of coagulating the severed tissue with the same electrosurgical probe during a single procedure, according to one embodiment of the invention. The electrosurgical probe typically comprises an active electrode in the form of a single, substantially flat metal hook or blade having at least one active edge adapted for electrosurgically severing the tissue, and first and second blade sides adapted for effecting hemostasis of the severed tissue. Steps <b>1000</b>′ through <b>1006</b>′ are substantially the same or analogous to steps <b>1000</b> through <b>1006</b>, as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>. Step <b>1008</b>′ involves severing the target tissue via localized molecular dissociation of tissue components due to high current densities generated at the position of an active edge upon execution of step <b>1004</b>′. Step <b>1010</b>′ involves engaging the first and second blade sides against the tissue severed in step <b>1008</b>′, whereby blood/blood vessels in the severed tissue are coagulated as a result of the relatively low current densities on the first and second blade sides (step <b>1012</b>′).</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> schematically represents a number of steps involved in a method of dissecting a tissue or organ of a patient with an electrosurgical probe having a hook or blade active electrode, according to one embodiment of the invention, wherein step <b>1100</b> involves accessing an organ or tissue. Typically, accessing an organ or tissue in step <b>1100</b> involves incising an overlying tissue which conceals the organ or tissue to be dissected. As an example, in an open chest procedure involving a median stemotomy, the thoracic cavity is accessed by making a longitudinal incision though the sternum. Incising an overlying tissue in step <b>1100</b> may be performed generally according to the methods described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref> or <b>43</b>B. Step <b>1102</b> involves positioning the distal end of the electrosurgical probe, and in particular an active edge of the hook or blade active electrode, in at least close proximity to connective tissue adjacent to the tissue or organ to be dissected. As an example, the connective tissue may be soft tissue, such as adipose tissue, or relatively hard tissue such as cartilage or bone. Optional step <b>1104</b> involves delivering an electrically conductive fluid to the distal end of the probe such that the electrically conductive fluid forms a current flow path between the active electrode and the return electrode, generally as described for step <b>1002</b>, supra. Step <b>1106</b> involves applying a high frequency voltage between the active electrode and the return electrode, generally as described for step <b>1004</b>, supra.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Depending on the type of procedure, e.g., the nature of the tissue or organ to be dissected, optional step <b>1108</b> may be performed, in which the probe is manipulated such that an active edge of the active electrode is moved with respect to the connective tissue adjacent to the tissue or organ to be dissected. Where the active electrode comprises a hook, the hook may be engaged against the connective tissue and drawn towards the operator of the probe to precisely control the degree of cutting or tissue removal. Step <b>1110</b> involves electrosurgically ablating, via molecular dissociation of connective tissue components, at least a portion of the connective tissue adjacent to the tissue or organ to be dissected. As an example, connective tissue adjacent to the internal mammary artery may be dissected by a process involving molecular dissociation of connective tissue components, in either an open-chest or a minimally invasive procedure, such that the IMA is substantially free from connective tissue over a portion of its length.</p>

In contrast to system <b>1200</b>′, in the embodiment of system <b>1200</b>″, mode switch <b>1240</b> is responsive to movement of active electrode <b>1212</b> or movement of return electrode <b>1218</b>, such that system <b>1200</b>″ is switched between the ablation and sub-ablation modes as the probe shifts between the first and second configuration. In both system <b>1200</b>′ and system <b>1200</b>″, mode switch <b>1240</b> may be integrated with actuator unit <b>1230</b>, integrated with power supply <b>1250</b>, or may be a separate device.</p>

In the closed configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52A</figref>, a fixed return electrode <b>1218</b>″ lies substantially parallel to a moveable active electrode <b>1212</b>″.

<p id="p-0214" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref> schematically represents a number of steps involved in a method of coagulating and severing a target tissue with an electrosurgical probe, wherein step <b>1300</b> involves advancing the electrosurgical probe towards the target tissue. The probe typically includes opposing active and return electrodes arranged at a shaft distal end portion, wherein at least one of the active and return electrodes is moveable such that the shaft distal end portion can adopt an open configuration or a closed configuration. Step <b>1302</b> involves configuring the probe such that the shaft distal end is in the open or partially open configuration. Typically, in the open configuration, the probe can accommodate at least a portion of a target tissue and/or a portion of a blood vessel between the active and return electrodes. The probe may be configured to the open configuration via an actuator unit, for example, by actuation of a release unit of the actuator unit.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Step <b>1304</b> involves positioning the target tissue between the active and return electrodes. Step <b>1306</b> involves configuring the probe such that the shaft distal end is in the closed or partially closed configuration. For example, the active electrode and/or the return electrode may be urged towards the closed configuration via actuation of a clamp unit of the actuator unit. In this manner, the target tissue, e.g., a portion of a blood vessel, may be clamped between the active electrode and the return electrode. The clamp unit and the release unit may be hand- or foot-operated by the surgeon, as described hereinabove, e.g., with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Step <b>1308</b> involves applying a first high frequency voltage between the active electrode and the return electrode. Typically, the first high frequency voltage is sufficient to coagulate the target tissue, but insufficient to ablate the tissue via molecular dissociation of tissue components, i.e., the system is operating in the sub-ablation mode. Step <b>1310</b> involves coagulating the target tissue or blood vessel as a result of the voltage applied in step <b>1308</b>. Thereafter, step <b>1312</b> involves applying a second high frequency voltage between the active electrode and the return electrode sufficient to ablate, or Coblate, the tissue via molecular dissociation of tissue components. That is to say, during step <b>1308</b> the system is operating in the ablation mode. Voltage levels characteristic of the sub-ablation mode and the ablation mode are presented hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">According to one aspect of the invention, during a procedure the electrosurgical system may be conveniently switched, “automatically,” between the sub-ablation and ablation modes via a mode switch (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45B-C</figref>). In one embodiment of the invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45B</figref>), the mode switch may be directly responsive to actuation of the actuator unit, such that the system is automatically switched to the ablation mode when the release unit is actuated to force the probe into the open configuration. Similarly, the system may be automatically switched to the sub-ablation mode when the clamp unit is actuated to urge the probe into the closed configuration. According to an alternative embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45C</figref>), the mode switch may be responsive to movement of a moveable electrode (either a moveable active electrode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52A-B</figref>) or a moveable return electrode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48B-D</figref>), such that the system is automatically switched to the ablation mode when the at least one moveable electrode is moved into the open configuration, and/or the system is automatically switched to the sub-ablation mode when the at least one moveable electrode is moved into the closed configuration. Optional step <b>1314</b> involves manipulating the probe during step <b>1312</b>, such that the active electrode is engaged and moved against the coagulated target tissue. As a result of application of the second high frequency voltage the coagulated target tissue is severed due to the localized molecular dissociation of tissue components, step <b>1316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53B</figref> schematically represents a number of steps involved in a method of modifying and/or ablating a target tissue with an electrosurgical system including a probe and a high frequency power supply, wherein step <b>1400</b> involves clamping a target tissue. In one aspect, the target tissue may comprise a portion of a blood vessel. For example, during resection of a connective tissue via electrosurgical ablation, the surgeon may encounter one or more substantial blood vessels which require coagulation before proceeding with the resection. Upon encountering such a blood vessel, the surgeon may coagulate the blood vessel, as follows. With the electric power from the power supply turned off, or with the electrosurgical system operating in a sub-ablation mode, the blood vessel may be clamped between the active and return electrodes, essentially as described hereinabove, e.g., with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref>. Thereafter, with the electrosurgical system in the sub-ablation mode, step <b>1402</b> involves applying a first high frequency voltage between the active electrode and the return electrode, wherein the first high frequency voltage is effective in coagulating the blood vessel, but insufficient to ablate the blood vessel. As used in this context, the term “ablate” refers to electrosurgical ablation via molecular dissociation of tissue components at relatively low temperatures (typically in the range of about 45° C. to 90° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">While the blood vessel or other target tissue remains clamped by the probe, step <b>1404</b> involves coagulating the clamped blood vessel or other target tissue as a result of the first high frequency voltage applied in step <b>1402</b>. After coagulation has occurred to a suitable extent, optional step <b>1406</b> involves releasing or unclamping the clamped vessel or other target tissue from the probe. Typically, releasing the target tissue involves configuring the probe to the open or partially open configuration, e.g., via a release unit of the electrosurgical system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>). Thereafter, the electrosurgical system is switched to the ablation mode, and a second, higher voltage is applied between the active electrode and the return electrode in step <b>1408</b>, wherein the second voltage is sufficient to ablate the coagulated tissue via molecular dissociation of tissue components.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">With the probe in the open configuration, the probe may be manipulated by the surgeon such that the active electrode is engaged and moved against the coagulated tissue, step <b>1410</b>. Step <b>1412</b> involves severing the coagulated tissue via localized molecular dissociation of tissue components. In the example cited above, namely wherein a blood vessel is encountered during resection of a tissue, after the blood vessel has been coagulated and severed according to steps <b>1400</b> through <b>1412</b>, with the system operating in the ablation mode, the surgeon may then resume resection via molecular dissociation of tissue components. During resection of tissue such as connective tissue, the probe will typically be in the open configuration (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48E</figref>). However, in embodiments of probe <b>1201</b> in which the active electrode protrudes both laterally and distally from the electrode support (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48A-C</figref>), the probe may also be used in the closed configuration for ablation or modification of target tissue.</p>
