<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to package openers and, more specifically, to a device for opening packages that are shrink wrapped, including but not limited to CD, VCR and DVD cases and other tightly wrapped cartons. The present invention is designed to tear and pull the shrink-wrap material thereby making it easy and safe\ to open. The device is equipped with cutting teeth that provide versatility by enabling it to penetrate and tear cardboard cartons along with plastic shrink wrap material. The package opening device of the present invention is versatile and may be used to open a multitude of products.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are other package openers designed for similar purposes. Typical of these is U.S. Pat. No. 394,547 issued to D. W. Thacker on Dec. 11, 1888.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A patent was issued to C. L. Whiteford on Jul. 3, 1973 as U.S. Pat. No. 3,742,787. Yet another U.S. Pat. No. 3,935,762 was issued to V. J. Tudisco on Feb. 3, 1976 and still yet another was issued on May 2, 1978 to L. T. Smith as U.S. Pat. No. 4,086,831.</p>

<heading id="h-0040" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The following discussion describes in detail one embodiment of the invention (and several variations of that embodiment). This discussion should not be construed, however, as limiting the invention to those particular embodiments. Practitioners skilled in the art will recognize numerous other embodiments as well. For definition of the complete scope of the invention, the reader is directed to appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> illustrate the package opener of the present invention which is indicated generally by the numeral <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The package opener <b>10</b> of the present invention is shown illustratively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Shown herein, a user <b>14</b> is opening a sealed CD/DVD case <b>12</b> with the package opener <b>10</b> of the present invention. The package opener <b>10</b> comprises a shaft <b>20</b> having a first end and a second end. The shaft <b>20</b> of the package opener <b>10</b> is made of a non-slip material in order to prevent slippage. A handle <b>18</b> is attached to the first end of shaft <b>20</b>. The handle <b>18</b> is preferably bulbous in shape to allow for an easier and more comfortable hand held position. However, the handle <b>18</b> maybe formed in any shape that allows for comfortable gripping by a user <b>14</b>. A cutting member <b>22</b> is attached to the second end of shaft <b>20</b>. The cutting member <b>22</b> is substantially L-shaped and includes a plurality of teeth <b>24</b> positioned at an end of the cutting member not connected to the shaft <b>20</b>. The cutting teeth <b>24</b> are positioned on a section of the L-shaped cutting member <b>22</b> that is substantially perpendicular to the shaft <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The way in which the package opener <b>10</b> of the present invention is used will now be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Initially, the user <b>14</b> grips the bulbous handle <b>18</b> in a the palm of the users hand and wrap fingers around the shaft <b>20</b> to steady the opener <b>10</b> in the user's hand. The user <b>14</b> then places the teeth <b>24</b> of the cutting member <b>22</b> in contact with each of a seal <b>26</b> and the container <b>12</b>. Preferably, the user positions the teeth <b>24</b> at an edge of the seal <b>26</b> and between the seal <b>26</b> and the container <b>12</b>. Thereafter, the user applies pressure to the shaft <b>20</b> and the cutting member <b>22</b> is moved along a length of the seal <b>26</b> so as to at least one of pierce, peel and remove the seal <b>26</b> of the case <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown herein, the seal <b>26</b> is a sticker that covers an edge of the case <b>12</b>. However, the seal <b>26</b> is object or mechanism used to prevent access to an object retained within a case. This includes but is not limited to shrink wrap that covers all surfaces of the case as well as plastic film that covers and is sealed around the case.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustrative view of the package opener of the present invention in use. The package opener <b>10</b> comprises a shaft <b>20</b> having a first end and a second end.

The handle <b>18</b> is preferably bulbous in shape to allow for an easier and more comfortable hand held position. However, the handle <b>18</b> maybe formed in any shape that allows for comfortable gripping by a user <b>14</b>. A cutting member <b>22</b> is attached to the second end of shaft <b>20</b>. The cutting member <b>22</b> is substantially L-shaped and includes a plurality of teeth <b>24</b> positioned at an end of the cutting member not connected to the shaft <b>20</b>. The cutting teeth <b>24</b> are positioned on a section of the L-shaped cutting member <b>22</b> that is substantially perpendicular to the shaft <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The user <b>14</b> applies pressure against the shaft <b>20</b> thereby penetrating the wrapper/seal <b>26</b> with the teeth <b>24</b> of the cutting member <b>22</b>. The package opener <b>10</b> is moved along the length of the seal <b>26</b> in a direction indicated by the bi-directional arrow labeled with the reference numeral <b>28</b> thereby breaking the seal <b>26</b> and opening the case <b>12</b>. The device allows people that suffer from arthritis and other hand related problems to be able to open plastic shrink wrap items and various other items such as boxes in an easy and safe manner. The packaging opener is a versatile tool that may be used in various ways to aid the user in opening many types of wrapped and packaged items.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, the package opener <b>10</b> can be used to tear open an unsealed light weight carton, including but not limited to a cosmetics box. In one embodiment, the user <b>14</b> inserts the cutting member into the seam of the box and pulls the package opener <b>10</b> at a substantially 45 degree angle to tear the top from the box.</p>
