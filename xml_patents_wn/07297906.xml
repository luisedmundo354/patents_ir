<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to the field of substrate processing equipment. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling the temperature of substrates, such as semiconductor substrates, used in the formation of integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern integrated circuits contain millions of individual elements that are formed by patterning the materials, such as silicon, metal and/or dielectric layers, that make up the integrated circuit to sizes that are small fractions of a micrometer. The technique used throughout the industry for forming such patterns is photolithography. A typical photolithography process sequence generally includes depositing one or more uniform photoresist (resist) layers on the surface of a substrate, drying and curing the deposited layers, patterning the substrate by exposing the photoresist layer to electromagnetic radiation that is suitable for modifying the exposed layer and then developing the patterned photoresist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is common in the semiconductor industry for many of the steps associated with the photolithography process to be performed in a multi-chamber processing system (e.g., a cluster tool) that has the capability to sequentially process semiconductor wafers in a controlled manner. One example of a cluster tool that is used to deposit (i.e., coat) and develop a photoresist material is commonly referred to as a track lithography tool.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Track lithography tools typically include a mainframe that houses multiple chambers (which are sometimes referred to herein as stations) dedicated to performing the various tasks associated with pre- and post-lithography processing. There are typically both wet and dry processing chambers within track lithography tools. Wet chambers include coat and/or develop bowls, while dry chambers include thermal control units that house bake and/or chill plates. Track lithography tools also frequently include one or more pod/cassette mounting devices, such as an industry standard FOUP (front opening unified pod), to receive substrates from and return substrates to the clean room, multiple substrate transfer robots to transfer substrates between the various chambers/stations of the track tool and an interface that allows the tool to be operatively coupled to a lithography exposure tool in order to transfer substrates into the exposure tool and receive substrates from the exposure tool after the substrates are processed within the exposure tool.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Over the years there has been a strong push within the semiconductor industry to shrink the size of semiconductor devices. The reduced feature sizes have caused the industry's tolerance to process variability to shrink, which in turn, has resulted in semiconductor manufacturing specifications having more stringent requirements for process uniformity and repeatability. An important factor in minimizing process variability during track lithography processing sequences is to ensure that every substrate processed within the track lithography tool for a particular application has the same “wafer history.” A substrate's wafer history is generally monitored and controlled by process engineers to ensure that all of the device fabrication processing variables that may later affect a device's performance are controlled, so that all substrates in the same batch are always processed the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To ensure that each substrate has the same “wafer history” requires that each substrate experiences the same repeatable substrate processing steps (e.g., consistent coating process, consistent hard bake process, consistent chill process, etc.) and the timing between the various processing steps is the same for each substrate. Lithography type device fabrication processes can be especially sensitive to variations in process recipe variables and the timing between the recipe steps, which directly affects process variability and ultimately device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of these requirements, the semiconductor industry is continuously researching methods and developing tools and techniques that can improve the uniformity in wafer history for track lithography and other types of cluster tools.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, methods and apparatus related to semiconductor manufacturing equipment are provided. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and apparatus for heating and/or cooling a substrate in a highly controllable manner. Embodiments of the invention contemplate multiple substrates being processed according to the same heating and cooling sequence in a highly controllable manner thus helping to ensure a consistent wafer history for each substrate. While some embodiments of the invention are particularly useful in heating and/or cooling substrates in a chamber or station of a track lithography tool, other embodiments of the invention can be used in other applications where it is desirable to heat and cool substrates in a highly controllable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain embodiments of the invention pertain to an integrated thermal unit. According to one such embodiment, an integrated thermal unit comprises a bake plate configured to heat a substrate supported on a surface of the bake plate; a chill plate configured to cool a substrate supported on a surface of the chill plate; and a substrate transfer shuttle configured to transfer substrates from the bake plate to the cool plate, the substrate transfer shuttle having a temperature controlled substrate holding surface that is capable of cooling a substrate heated by the bake plate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another embodiment of the invention, an integrated thermal unit comprises a bake station comprising a bake plate configured to hold and heat a substrate; a chill station comprising a chill plate configured to hold and cool a substrate; and a substrate transfer shuttle configured to transfer substrates from the bake plate to the chill plate along a horizontally linear path within the thermal unit and raise and lower substrates along a vertical path within the integrated thermal unit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another embodiment of the invention, an integrated thermal unit comprises a bake plate having a substrate holding surface configured to hold and heat a substrate in a baking position; and a chill plate having a substrate holding surface configured to hold and cool a substrate in a cooling position where the substrate holding surface of the bake plate is positioned in a first substantially horizontal plane when the bake plate is in the baking position and the substrate holding surface of the chill plate is positioned in a second substantially horizontal plane that is below the first plane when the chill plate is in a cooling position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to still another embodiment of the invention, a bake station is provided. The bake station comprises a bake plate adapted to heat a substrate supported on an upper surface of the bake plate, the bake plate vertically moveable between an upper baking position and a lower cooling position; and a plurality of heat sinks adapted to be engageably coupled to a lower surface of the bake plate when the bake plate is in the lower cooling position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain other embodiments of the invention pertain to a track lithography tool comprising a plurality of pod assemblies adapted to accept one or more cassettes of wafers and one or more robots adapted to transfer wafers from the one or more pod assemblies to processing modules within the track lithography tool, wherein at least one of the processing modules includes an integrated thermal unit according to one of the embodiments described above.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still other embodiments of the invention pertain to methods of processing a substrate in an integrated thermal unit. According to one such embodiment, a method of processing a substrate in a integrated thermal unit having a bake plate and a chill plate comprises transferring a substrate having a liquid resist material applied thereon into the integrated thermal unit; positioning the substrate on the bake plate; heating the substrate with the bake plate; transferring the substrate from the bake plate to the chill plate with a shuttle having a temperature controlled surface; cooling the substrate with the chill plate; and transferring the substrate out of the integrated thermal unit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another embodiment, a method of processing a substrate in a integrated thermal unit having a bake plate and a chill plate comprises transferring a substrate having a liquid resist material applied thereon into the integrated thermal unit; positioning the substrate on the bake plate; heating the substrate with the bake plate; transferring the substrate from the bake plate to the chill plate, wherein the transferring includes moving, within the integrated thermal unit, the substrate along a horizontally linear path and along a vertical path with a substrate transfer shuttle; cooling the substrate with the chill plate; and transferring the substrate out of the integrated thermal unit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another embodiment, a method of processing a substrate in a integrated thermal unit having a bake plate and a chill plate comprises transferring a substrate having a liquid resist material applied thereon into the integrated thermal unit; positioning the substrate on the bake plate; heating the substrate with the bake plate; transferring the substrate from the bake plate to the chill plate with a shuttle having a temperature controlled surface; cooling the substrate with the chill plate; and transferring the substrate out of the integrated thermal unit.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to still another embodiment of the invention a method of rapidly reducing a set point temperature of a bake plate is provided. This embodiment comprises, after using the bake plate to heat a substrate disposed on an upper surface of the bake plate while the bake plate is in a baking position, vertically moving the bake plate to a lower position in which a lower surface of the bake plate contacts a plurality of heat sinks adapted to be engageably coupled to the lower surface of the bake plate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Many benefits are achieved by way of the present invention over conventional techniques. For example, including bake and chill plates in one integrated unit minimizes the delay associated with transferring a baked wafer to the chill plate. Also, the inclusion of a shuttle having a temperature controlled substrate holding surface that transfers wafers between the bake and chill plates provides an additional degree of control over each wafer's thermal history thus enabling a more uniform thermal history among multiple wafers. Moreover, embodiments of the invention increase chamber throughput by decreasing the load on the main, central robot(s) of a track lithography tool and provide a safe haven for post-bake wafers in case of a malfunction of a main, central robot. Other embodiments increase wafer throughput by decreasing the amount of time it take to change the set point temperature of a bake plate from a first temperature to a second temperature lower than the first temperature.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention generally provides a method and apparatus for heating and cooling substrates in a highly controllable manner. While it is to be recognized that embodiments of the invention are particularly useful in helping to ensure a consistent wafer history for each substrate in a plurality of substrates that are heated and cooled according a particular thermal recipe within a track lithography tool, other embodiments of the invention can be used in other applications where it is desirable to heat and cool substrates in a highly controllable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified conceptual view of one embodiment of an integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> according to the present invention. Integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> includes a bake station <b>12</b>, a chill station <b>14</b> and a shuttle station <b>16</b> all within an enclosed housing <b>40</b>. Chill station <b>16</b> includes a shuttle <b>18</b> for transferring substrates between the bake and chill stations as needed. Bake station <b>12</b> includes a bake plate <b>20</b>, an enclosure <b>22</b> and a chill base <b>24</b>. Bake plate <b>20</b> is moveable between a wafer loading position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a closed heating position in which the bake plate is urged towards and within clam shell enclosure <b>22</b> by a motorized lift <b>28</b> and a cooling position in which the bake plate contacts chill base <b>24</b>. Chill base <b>24</b> is engageably coupled to bake plate chill to enable the set point temperature of the bake plate to be rapidly changed from a relatively high, bake temperature to a lower bake temperature when, for example, switching to a new thermal recipe.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Chill station <b>14</b> includes a chill plate <b>30</b> and a particle shield <b>32</b> that protects a wafer situated on chill plate <b>30</b> from possible particle contamination when shuttle <b>18</b> passes over the chill station to transfer a wafer to or from bake station <b>12</b>. Substrates can be transferred into and out of thermal unit <b>10</b> through elongated openings that are operatively coupled to shutters <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, which is a simplified perspective view of integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, thermal unit <b>10</b> includes an exterior housing <b>40</b> made of aluminum or another suitable material. Housing <b>40</b> is long relative to its height in order to allow bake station <b>12</b>, chill station <b>14</b> and shuttle station <b>16</b> to be laterally adjacent to each other and to allow multiple integrated thermal units to be stacked on top of each other in a track lithography tool as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In one particular embodiment, housing <b>40</b> is just 20 centimeters high.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Housing <b>40</b> includes side pieces <b>40</b><i>a</i>, a top piece <b>40</b><i>b </i>and a bottom piece <b>40</b><i>c</i>. Front side piece <b>40</b><i>a </i>includes two elongated openings <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>that allow substrates to be transferred into and out of the thermal unit. Opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is operatively coupled to be closed and sealed by shutter <b>34</b><i>a </i>(not shown) and opening <b>41</b><i>b </i>is operatively coupled to be closed and sealed by shutter <b>34</b><i>b </i>(also not shown). Top piece <b>40</b><i>b </i>of housing <b>40</b> includes coolant channels <b>42</b> that allow a coolant fluid to be circulated through the channels in order to control the temperature of top piece <b>40</b><i>b </i>when an appropriate plate (not shown) is attached to top piece <b>40</b><i>b </i>via screw holes <b>44</b>. Similar coolant channels are formed in the lower surface of bottom piece <b>40</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is various control circuitry <b>46</b><i>a</i>-<b>46</b><i>d </i>which controls the precision baking operation of bake station <b>12</b> and the precision cooling operation of chill station <b>14</b>; and tracks <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> that enable shuttle <b>18</b> (not visible within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) to move linearly along the length of the thermal unit and vertically within the thermal unit as discussed in more detail below. In one embodiment, control circuitry <b>46</b><i>a</i>-<b>46</b><i>b </i>is positioned near stations <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> (e.g., within three feet) in order to enable more accurate and responsive control of temperature adjusting mechanisms associated with each station.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a simplified perspective view of integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> as seen with top <b>40</b><i>b </i>and particle shield <b>32</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) removed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, shuttle <b>18</b>, chill plate <b>30</b> and clam shell enclosure <b>22</b> of bake station <b>12</b> are visible. Also visible is a space <b>47</b> between rear support piece <b>90</b> of housing <b>40</b> and bottom piece <b>40</b><i>c</i>. Space <b>47</b>, which is also visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, extends along much of the length of integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> to allow shuttle <b>18</b> to transfer wafers between stations <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> as discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to better appreciate and understand the general operation of integrated thermal unit <b>10</b>, reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> along with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a simplified block diagram that illustrates a sequence of events that is performed by thermal unit <b>10</b> to thermally treat wafers according to one embodiment of the method of the present invention. A wafer may be treated in accordance with the process set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> after, for example, having a photoresist layer deposited over the wafer at an appropriate coating station of a track lithography tool. While the discussion below focuses on treating a single wafer within unit <b>10</b>, a person of skill in the art will appreciate that thermal unit <b>10</b> will often be used to simultaneously process two wafers. For example, while one wafer is being heated on bake plate <b>20</b>, thermal unit <b>10</b> can be in the process of cooling another wafer on chill plate <b>30</b> or transferring another wafer out of the thermal unit at the completion of its thermal treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a wafer's history in thermal unit <b>10</b> starts by transferring the wafer into the thermal unit <b>10</b> through wafer transfer slot <b>41</b><i>b </i>and placing the wafer onto stationary lift pins <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at shuttle station <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>50</b>). The wafer may be transferred into thermal unit <b>10</b> by, for example, a central robot that services both wafer transfer slots <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>41</b><i>b </i>as well as one or more coating or developing stations in a track lithography tool (not shown). Typically wafer transfer slot <b>41</b><i>b </i>is closed by shutter <b>34</b><i>b</i>, thus step <b>50</b> also includes moving shutter <b>34</b><i>b </i>to open slot <b>41</b><i>b</i>. During step <b>50</b> shuttle <b>18</b> is in a wafer receiving position at station <b>16</b> where lift pins <b>36</b> extend through slots <b>19</b><i>a </i>and <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the shuttle <b>18</b>. After the wafer is properly positioned on lift pins <b>36</b>, the robot arm recedes out of the thermal unit and chill shuttle <b>18</b> is raised to lift the wafer off of stationary lift pins <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>51</b>) and then moved linearly along the length of the thermal unit to transfer the wafer to bake station <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>52</b>). The path to bake station <b>12</b> takes shuttle <b>18</b> over particle shield <b>32</b> at chill station <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At bake station <b>12</b>, the wafer is placed on lift pins <b>38</b> and shuttle <b>18</b> is free to handle another task or return to its home position at shuttle station <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>53</b>). While the shuttle is being returned to home position, bake plate <b>20</b> is raised by motorized lift <b>28</b> thereby picking the wafer up off of stationary lift pins <b>38</b> and bringing the wafer into its bake position within clam shell enclosure <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>54</b>). Once inside claim shell enclosure <b>22</b> the wafer is heated or baked according to a desired thermal recipe (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>55</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After completion of bake step <b>55</b>, the bake plate <b>20</b> is lowered to its wafer receiving position dropping the wafer off on lift pins <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>56</b>). Next, shuttle <b>18</b> returns to bake station <b>12</b> and picks the wafer up off of lift pins <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>57</b>) and brings the wafer to chill station <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>58</b>). The path to chill station <b>14</b> takes shuttle over particle shield <b>32</b> to shuttle station <b>16</b> where shuttle <b>18</b> is lowered and then moved towards chill station <b>14</b>. Once at chill station <b>14</b>, lift pins <b>37</b> are raised by a pneumatic lift to lift the wafer off of the shuttle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>59</b>). Shuttle <b>18</b> is then free to handle another task or return to its home position at station <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>60</b>) and lift pins <b>37</b> are lowered to drop the wafer of onto chill plate <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>61</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The wafer is then cooled on chill plate <b>30</b> according to a predetermined thermal recipe (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>62</b>). After completion of the cooling process, lift pins <b>37</b> are raised to pick the wafer up off of the chill plate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>63</b>) and the wafer is transferred out of the integrated thermal unit through elongated slot <b>41</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, step <b>64</b>) by, for example, being picked up by the same central robot that transferred the wafer into the thermal unit in step <b>50</b>. Typically, elongated slot <b>41</b><i>a </i>is closed by shutter <b>34</b><i>a</i>, thus step <b>64</b> also includes opening shutter <b>34</b><i>a </i>to open slot <b>41</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments of the invention allow a process such as that described above to be carried out in a highly controllable and highly repeatable manner. Thus, embodiments of the invention help ensure an extremely high degree of uniformity in the thermal treatment of each wafer that is processed within integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> according to a particular thermal recipe. As discussed in more detail below, a number of specific aspects of the present invention can be used independent from each other or in combination to help achieve such a repeatable, uniform wafer history.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One such aspect is the placement of hot plate <b>20</b> with respect to chill plate <b>30</b>. Specifically, in some embodiments of the invention hot plate <b>20</b> is positioned within integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> at a position that is higher than the position of chill plate <b>30</b>. Because heat generated from bake plate <b>20</b> generally rises to an upper portion of thermal unit <b>10</b>, such positioning helps minimize thermal cross-talk between the bake station and chill station that may otherwise lead to discrepancies in the thermal treatment of wafers over time.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">This aspect of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which is a simplified cross-sectional view of a portion of integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> showing bake plate <b>20</b> and chill plate <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when hot plate <b>20</b> is within claim shell enclosure <b>22</b> at a baking position <b>71</b>, wafer support surface <b>70</b> lies in a horizontal plane A that is well above the horizontal plane C that wafer support surface <b>72</b> of chill plate <b>30</b> lies in. In some embodiments plane A is at least 4 cm above plane C and in one particular embodiment plane A is 6 cm above plane C. Furthermore, in some embodiments of the invention even when the bake plate is engaged with heat sinks <b>140</b> (described below) while in a wafer receiving position, upper surface <b>70</b> of the bake plate lies in a horizontal plane B that is above the upper surface <b>72</b> of the chill plate (plane C). In some embodiments plane B is at least 2 cm above plane C and in one particular embodiments plane B is 2.5 cm above plane C. Also, in some embodiments the upper surface of particle shield <b>32</b> also lies in or substantially closed to plane B.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Maintaining such a height difference in the positions of bake plate <b>20</b> and chill plate <b>30</b> helps minimize thermal cross-talk between the two stations and helps ensure a highly controlled, repeatable thermal treatment among multiple wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Another aspect of the present invention that helps ensure an extremely high degree of uniformity in the thermal treatment of each wafer is the design of shuttle <b>18</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a simplified perspective view of shuttle <b>18</b>, the shuttle includes a wafer receiving area <b>74</b> upon which a semiconductor wafer is placed while the shuttle is transferring the wafer from one station to another. In one embodiment, shuttle <b>18</b> is made from aluminum and wafer receiving area <b>74</b> and other portions of an upper surface <b>75</b> of the shuttle are actively cooled by a coolant (e.g., deionized water) that flows through coolant passages (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as passages <b>75</b>) in the shuttle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The coolant is delivered to passages <b>75</b> by tubes that connect to inlets/outlets <b>76</b>, which in turn connect to a manifold (not shown) within portion <b>79</b> of shuttle <b>18</b> that helps distribute the fluid evenly throughout the shuttle. The fluid tubes are at least partially supported by fingers <b>78</b> of tube support mechanism <b>77</b> as shuttle <b>18</b> traverses the length of the integrated thermal unit. Actively cooling wafer receiving surface <b>74</b> helps maintain precise thermal control of wafer temperature during all times while the wafer is within thermal unit <b>10</b>. Actively cooling shuttle <b>18</b> also starts the wafer cooling process sooner than it would otherwise be initiated if such active cooling did not occur until the wafer is transferred to a dedicated chill station, which in turn reduces the overall thermal budget of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are slots <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b</i>, wafer pocket buttons <b>80</b> and small contact area proximity pins <b>82</b> and slots <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b</i>. Slots <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>allow the shuttle to be positioned or moved under a wafer being held by lift pins. For example, in chill station <b>14</b> a wafer is held above the chill plate prior to and after chill step <b>63</b> on a set of three lift pins arranged in a triangular formation (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> showing holes <b>84</b> that allow the lift pins to extend through chill plate <b>30</b>). Slot <b>19</b><i>a </i>is aligned to allow shuttle <b>18</b> to slide past two of the three lift pins and slot <b>19</b><i>b </i>is aligned to allow the shuttle to slide pass the third lift pin. Pocket buttons <b>80</b> screw into threaded holes in the upper surface of shuttle <b>18</b> and extend above the surface to help center a wafer within wafer receiving area <b>74</b>. Pocket buttons <b>80</b> can be made from any appropriately soft material, such as a thermoplastic material, that exhibits strong fatigue resistance and thermal stability. In one embodiment, buttons <b>80</b> are made from polyetheretherketone, which is also known as PEEK.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Proximity pins <b>82</b> are distributed across upper surface <b>74</b> of shuttle <b>18</b> and are fabricated from a material with a low coefficient of friction, such as sapphire. Proximity pins <b>82</b> allow the wafer being transported by shuttle <b>18</b> to be brought into very close proximity of temperature controlled surface <b>74</b>. The small space between the wafer and temperature controlled surface <b>74</b> helps create uniform cooling across the entire surface area of the wafer while at the same time minimizing contact between the underside of the wafer and the shuttle thus reducing the likelihood that particles or contaminants may be generated from such contact. Further details of proximity pins <b>82</b> are set forth in U.S. application Ser. No. 11/111,155, entitled “Purged Vacuum Chuck with Proximity Pins” filed on Apr. 20, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. In one particular embodiment shuttle <b>18</b> includes four pocket buttons <b>80</b> and seventeen proximity pins <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Shuttle <b>18</b> also includes an elongated U-shaped support bracket <b>86</b> that allows the shuttle to be mounted to a support plate <b>88</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is a perspective view of a portion of integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> having bake station <b>12</b> and chill station <b>14</b> removed. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, support plate <b>88</b> loops under and around rear support piece <b>90</b>, which is mounted to bottom plate <b>40</b><i>c</i>, through slot <b>47</b>. Plate <b>88</b> (and thus shuttle <b>18</b>) can be moved linearly along a track <b>48</b> (horizontal path X). Plate <b>88</b> also slides vertically along track <b>49</b> allowing shuttle <b>18</b> to be raised and lowered (vertical path Z) in order to pick up and/or drop off wafers at a particular station.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is a perspective view of chill plate <b>30</b> according to one embodiment of the invention, chill plate <b>30</b> includes a coolant inlet <b>95</b> and outlet <b>96</b> that allow a coolant liquid, such as deionized water, to be circulated through coolant channels (not shown) to cool a wafer supported on wafer support surface <b>72</b>. Chill plate <b>30</b> also includes a number of wafer pocket buttons <b>85</b> and small contact area proximity pins <b>83</b> that are similar to buttons <b>80</b> and proximity pins <b>82</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In one particular embodiment, chill plate <b>30</b> includes eight pocket buttons <b>85</b> and seventeen proximity pins <b>83</b>. Also, while not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, chill plate <b>30</b> may include a plurality of vacuum ports and be operatively coupled to a vacuum chuck to secure a wafer to the chill plate during the cooling process.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a particle shield <b>32</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is positioned above chill plate <b>30</b> in order to protect the chill plate, and any wafer positioned on the chill plate, from possible particle contamination when shuttle <b>18</b> traverses between bake station <b>12</b> and shuttle station <b>16</b> over chill plate <b>30</b>. Particle shield <b>32</b> is connected to bottom housing piece <b>40</b><i>c </i>between bake station <b>12</b> and chill station <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and front side piece <b>40</b><i>a </i>of housing <b>40</b> in a manner that allows shuttle <b>18</b> to pass under the particle shield and access chill plate <b>30</b> as needed. In one particular embodiment, particle shield <b>32</b> is made from stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> where <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of bake station <b>12</b> shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> according to one embodiment of the invention; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of a cross-section of bake station <b>12</b> shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the bake station. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, bake station <b>12</b> has three separate isothermal heating elements: bake plate <b>20</b>, top heat plate <b>110</b> and side heat plate <b>112</b>, each of which is manufactured from a material exhibiting high heat conductivity, such as aluminum or other appropriate material. Each plate <b>20</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> has a heating element, for example, resistive heating elements, embedded within the plate. Bake station <b>12</b> also includes side top and bottom heat shields <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, respectively, as well as a bottom cup <b>119</b> that surrounds bake plate <b>20</b> and a lid <b>120</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> only). Each of heat shields <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, cup <b>119</b> and lid <b>120</b> are made from aluminum.

When in the baking position, cup <b>119</b> encircles a bottom portion of side heat plate <b>112</b> forming a clam shell arrangement that helps confine heat generated by bake plate <b>20</b> within an inner cavity formed by the bake plate and enclosure <b>22</b>. In one embodiment the upper surface of bake plate <b>20</b> includes 8 wafer pocket buttons and 17 proximity pins similar to those described with respect to shuttle <b>18</b> and chill plate <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">During the baking process, a faceplate <b>122</b> is positioned just above and opposite wafer support surface <b>70</b> of bake plate <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Gas from radially inward gas flow <b>124</b> is initially introduced into bake station <b>12</b> at an annular gas manifold <b>126</b> that encircles the outer portion of top heat plate <b>110</b> by a gas inlet line <b>127</b>.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An aspect of the invention that helps minimize any delay associated with switching from one thermal recipe to another thermal recipe an thus helps ensure high wafer throughput through integrated thermal unit <b>10</b> is discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a bottom perspective view of bake station <b>12</b> shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in one embodiment of the invention bake station <b>12</b> includes a plurality of engageable heat sinks <b>140</b>. Each engageable heat sink <b>140</b> is made from an appropriate heat sink material, such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel or other metal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As previously mentioned, bake plate <b>20</b> heats a wafer according to a particular thermal recipe. One component of the thermal recipe is typically a set point temperature at which the bake plate is set to heat the wafer. During the baking process, the temperature of the wafer is routinely measured and one or more zones of the bake plate can be adjusted to ensure uniform heating of the substrate. Typically bake plate is heated to the desired set point temperature while a large batch of wafers are processed according to the same thermal recipe. Thus, for example, if a particular thermal recipe calls for a set point temperature of 175° C. and that recipe is to be implemented on 100 consecutive wafers, bake plate <b>20</b> will be heated to 175° C. during the length of time it takes to process the 100 consecutive wafers. If, however, a subsequent batch of 200 wafers is to be processed according to a different thermal recipe that, for example, requires a set point temperature of 130° C., the set point temperature of bake plate <b>20</b> needs to be rapidly changed from 175° C. to 130° C. between processing the 100th and 101st wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Embodiments of the present invention enable a rapid reduction in the set point temperature of bake plate <b>20</b> by lowering the bake plate with motor <b>26</b> into a lower cooling position that is below the wafer receiving position. In the cooling position a bottom surface <b>73</b> of the bake plate contacts an upper surface <b>142</b> of each heat sink <b>140</b>. Contact between the heat sinks and bake plate is possible because bottom cup <b>119</b> includes a plurality of holes <b>138</b> that correspond to the plurality of heat sinks <b>140</b> allowing the heat sinks to extend through bottom cup <b>119</b> to contact bake plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a simplified cross-sectional view of an engageable heat sink <b>140</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, each engageable heat sink <b>140</b> includes a lower base portion <b>144</b> that has a larger diameter than the main body of the heat sink. Lower base portion <b>144</b> fits within a cavity <b>152</b> that is defined by bottom base plate <b>40</b><i>c </i>and an aluminum plate <b>150</b>. Base portion <b>144</b> of the heat sink engages a lip <b>154</b> of the bottom base plate and is pressed against the lip by a spring <b>145</b> positioned between aluminum plate <b>150</b> and base portion <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When bake plate <b>20</b> is lowered into the cooling position, spring <b>145</b> causes heat sink <b>140</b> to press upon lower surface of <b>73</b> of the bake plate. The combined thermal mass of all heat sinks <b>140</b> allows bake plate <b>20</b> to be rapidly cooled from one set point temperature to a lower set point temperature as may be required, for example, when transitioning to a new thermal recipe.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">While heat sink <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> is shown to be cylindrical in shape, many other shapes and sizes can be used. Also, in some embodiments, each heat sink <b>140</b> can be actively cooled by forming one or more coolant channels within the body of the heat sink. Also in some embodiments, heat sink <b>140</b> includes a thermal pad on its upper surface <b>142</b> that provides for smooth contact between the heat sink and bake plate during the engaging process.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a conceptual view of an alternative embodiment of an integrated thermal unit <b>150</b> according to the present invention. One primary difference between the embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is the placement of the bake, chill and shuttle stations <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the shuttle (shuttle <b>152</b> as compared to shuttle <b>18</b>) has been moved to a central position between the bake station and chill station. Such an arrangement provides a benefit in further reducing thermal cross-talk between the bake and chill stations and also alleviates the need for particle shield <b>32</b> to be positioned over chill plate <b>30</b> because shuttle <b>18</b> does not need to “fly over” the chill plate to deliver a wafer to bake plate <b>20</b>. One benefit of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as compared to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is the separation of shuttle <b>18</b> from bake plate <b>20</b> when the shuttle is in a position to receive wafers passed into the integrated thermal unit.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Also, shuttle <b>152</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is operatively configured to move linearly along a X-axis (horizontal path) along the length of housing <b>40</b> but is not configured to be moveable vertically. This difference requires moveable lift pins at each of the bake, chill and shuttle stations in order to properly exchange wafers between shuttle <b>152</b> and the station.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step <b>310</b>, a semiconductor substrate is transferred to a coat module.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the step of transferring the substrate to the coat module <b>310</b> is generally defined as the process of having front end robot <b>218</b> remove a substrate from a cassette <b>230</b> resting in one of the pod assemblies <b>216</b>. A cassette <b>230</b>, containing one or more substrates “W”, is placed on the pod assembly <b>216</b> by the user or some external device (not shown) so that the substrates can be processed in the cluster tool <b>200</b> by a user-defined substrate processing sequence controlled by software retained in the system controller <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The BARC coat step <b>310</b> is a step used to deposit an organic material over a surface of the substrate. The BARC layer is typically an organic coating that is applied onto the substrate prior to the photoresist layer to absorb light that otherwise would be reflected from the surface of the substrate back into the resist during the exposure step <b>326</b> performed in the stepper/scanner <b>5</b>. If these reflections are not prevented, standing waves will be established in the resist layer, which cause feature size to vary from one location to another depending on the local thickness of the resist layer. The BARC layer may also be used to level (or planarize) the substrate surface topography, which is generally present after completing multiple electronic device fabrication steps. The BARC material fills around and over the features to create a flatter surface for photoresist application and reduces local variations in resist thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">BARC coat step <b>310</b> is typically performed using a conventional spin-on resist dispense process in which an amount of the BARC material is deposited on the surface of the substrate while the substrate is being rotated which causes a solvent in the BARC material to evaporate and thus causes the material properties of the deposited BARC material to change. The air flow and exhaust flow rate in the BARC processing chamber is often controlled to control the solvent vaporization process and the properties of the layer formed on the substrate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Post BARC bake step <b>314</b>, is a step used to assure that all of the solvent is removed from the deposited BARC layer in BARC coat step <b>312</b>, and in some cases to promote adhesion of the BARC layer to the surface of the substrate. The temperature of post BARC bake step <b>314</b> is dependent on the type of BARC material deposited on the surface of the substrate, but will generally be less than about 250° C. The time required to complete post BARC bake step <b>314</b> will depend on the temperature of the substrate during the post BARC bake step, but will generally be less than about 60 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Post BARC chill step <b>316</b>, is a step used to control and assure that the time the substrate is above ambient temperature is consistent so that every substrate sees the same time-temperature profile and thus process variability is minimized. Variations in the BARC process time-temperature profile, which is a component of a substrates wafer history, can have an effect on the properties of the deposited film layer and thus is often controlled to minimize process variability. Post BARC chill step <b>316</b>, is typically used to cool the substrate after post BARC bake step <b>314</b> to a temperature at or near ambient temperature. The time required to complete post BARC chill step <b>316</b> will depend on the temperature of the substrate exiting the post BARC bake step, but will generally be less than about 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Photoresist coat step <b>318</b>, is a step used to deposit a photoresist layer over a surface of the substrate. The photoresist layer deposited during the photoresist coat step <b>318</b> is typically a light sensitive organic coating that are applied onto the substrate and is later exposed in the stepper/scanner <b>5</b> to form the patterned features on the surface of the substrate. Photoresist coat step <b>318</b> is a typically performed using conventional spin-on resist dispense process in which an amount of the photoresist material is deposited on the surface of the substrate while the substrate is being rotated which causes a solvent in the photoresist material to evaporate and thus causes the material properties of the deposited photoresist layer to change. The air flow and exhaust flow rate in the photoresist processing chamber is controlled to control the solvent vaporization process and the properties of the layer formed on the substrate surface. In some cases it may be necessary to control the partial pressure of the solvent over the substrate surface to control the vaporization of the solvent from the resist during the photoresist coat step by controlling the exhaust flow rate and/or by injecting a solvent near the substrate surface. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in an exemplary photoresist coating process, the substrate is first positioned on a wafer chuck in coater/developer module <b>234</b>. A motor rotates the wafer chuck and substrate while the photoresist is dispensed onto the center of the substrate. The rotation imparts an angular torque onto the photoresist, which forces the photoresist out in a radial direction, to ultimately covering the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Photoresist bake step <b>320</b>, is a step used to assure that all of the solvent is removed from the deposited photoresist layer in photoresist coat step <b>318</b>, and in some cases to promote adhesion of the photoresist layer to the BARC layer. The temperature of post photoresist bake step <b>320</b> is dependent on the type of photoresist material deposited on the surface of the substrate, but will generally be less than about 350° C.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The time required to complete post photoresist bake step <b>320</b> will depend on the temperature of the substrate during the post photoresist bake step, but will generally be less than about 60 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Post photoresist chill step <b>322</b>, is a step used to control the time the substrate is at a temperature above ambient temperature so that every substrate sees the same time-temperature profile and thus process variability is minimized. Variations in the time-temperature profile can have an effect on properties of the deposited film layer and thus is often controlled to minimize process variability. The temperature of post photoresist chill step <b>322</b>, is thus used to cool the substrate after post photoresist bake step <b>320</b> to a temperature at or near ambient temperature. The time required to complete post photoresist chill step <b>322</b> will depend on the temperature of the substrate exiting the post photoresist bake step, but will generally be less than about 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Optical edge bead removal (OEBR) step <b>324</b>, is a process used to expose the deposited light sensitive photoresist layer(s), such as, the layers formed during photoresist coat step <b>318</b> and the BARC layer formed during BARC coat step <b>312</b>, to a radiation source (not shown) so that either or both layers can be removed from the edge of the substrate and the edge exclusion of the deposited layers can be more uniformly controlled. The wavelength and intensity of the radiation used to expose the surface of the substrate will depend on the type of BARC and photoresist layers deposited on the surface of the substrate. An OEBR tool can be purchased, for example, from USHIO America, Inc. Cypress, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Exposure step <b>326</b>, is a lithographic projection step applied by a lithographic projection apparatus (e.g., stepper scanner <b>5</b>) to form a pattern which is used to manufacture integrated circuits (ICs). The exposure step <b>326</b> forms a circuit pattern corresponding to an individual layer of the integrated circuit (IC) device on the substrate surface, by exposing the photosensitive materials, such as, the photoresist layer formed during photoresist coat step <b>318</b> and the BARC layer formed during the BARC coat step <b>312</b> of some form of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Post exposure bake (PEB) step <b>328</b>, is a step used to heat a substrate immediately after exposure step <b>326</b> in order to stimulate diffusion of the photoactive compound(s) and reduce the effects of standing waves in the resist layer. For a chemically amplified resist, the PEB step also causes a catalyzed chemical reaction that changes the solubility of the resist. The control of the temperature during the PEB is typically critical to critical dimension (CD) control. The temperature of PEB step <b>328</b> is dependent on the type of photoresist material deposited on the surface of the substrate, but will generally be less than about 250° C. The time required to complete PEB step <b>328</b> will depend on the temperature of the substrate during the PEB step, but will generally be less than about 60 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Post exposure bake (PEB) chill step <b>330</b>, is a step used to control the assure that the time the substrate is at a temperature above ambient temperature is controlled so that every substrate sees the same time-temperature profile and thus process variability is minimized. Variations in the PEB process time-temperature profile can have an effect on properties of the deposited film layer and thus is often controlled to minimize process variability. The temperature of PEB chill step <b>330</b>, is thus used to cool the substrate after PEB step <b>328</b> to a temperature at or near ambient temperature. The time required to complete PEB chill step <b>330</b> will depend on the temperature of the substrate exiting the PEB step, but will generally be less than about 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Develop step <b>332</b>, is a process in which a solvent is used to cause a chemical or physical change to the exposed or unexposed photoresist and BARC layers to expose the pattern formed during exposure process step <b>326</b>. The develop process may be a spray or immersion or puddle type process that is used to dispense the developer solvent. In some develop processes, the substrate is coated with a fluid layer, typically deionized water, prior to application of the developer solution and spun during the development process. Subsequent application of the developer solution results in uniform coating of the developer on the substrate surface. In step <b>334</b>, a rinse solution is provided to surface of the substrate, terminating the develop process. Merely by way of example, the rinse solution may be deionized water. In alternative embodiments, a rinse solution of deionized water combined with a surfactant is provided. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In step <b>336</b>, the substrate is cooled after the develop and rinse stets <b>332</b> and <b>334</b>. In step <b>338</b>, the substrate is transferred to the pod, thus completing the processing sequence. Transferring the substrate to the pod in step <b>338</b> generally entails the process of having the front end robot <b>218</b> return the substrate to a cassette <b>230</b> resting in one of the pod assemblies <b>216</b>.</p>

A skilled artisan will also appreciate some of the various bake and chill sequences set just described have differing bake and or chill requirements. Thus, the skilled artisan will appreciate that the functional specifications of a particular bake plate <b>20</b> and/or chill plate <b>30</b> incorporated into the integrated thermal unit will depend on the material the bake and/or chill plate are intended to heat and cool, respectively. For example, BARC materials may be adequately heated with a low temperature, low precision bake plate (e.g., a maximum 250° C., single zone heater) while photoresist materials may require a high temperature, mid-precision bake plate (e.g., a maximum 350° C., three zone heater) and the post exposure bake process may require a low temperature, high precision bake plate (e.g., a maximum 250° C., fifteen zone heater). Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any particular type of or configuration of bake plate <b>20</b> or chill plate <b>30</b>.
