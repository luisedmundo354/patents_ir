<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a cleaner, and more particularly, to a hose assembly, which connects a dust-collecting chamber of a cleaner body to a suction brush and also serves as an auxiliary brush to clean a narrow area, especially having a handle enabling easy connection and disconnection of the hose assembly, and an upright-type vacuum cleaner having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an upright-type vacuum cleaner generally includes a cleaner body <b>10</b>, a suction brush <b>20</b> disposed at a lower portion of the cleaner body <b>10</b>, and a hose assembly <b>30</b> forming a suction flow channel connecting a dust-collecting chamber (not shown), disposed within the cleaner body, to the suction brush <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A driving chamber (not shown) disposed under the dust-collecting chamber of the cleaner body <b>10</b> houses therein a vacuum-generating device, and the dust-collecting chamber houses dirt-filtering means such as a paper filter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the vacuum-generating device is driven, there occurs a negative pressure in the dust-collecting chamber. Accordingly, air having entrained dirt is drawn into the dust-collecting chamber from a cleaning surface through the suction brush <b>20</b> and the hose assembly <b>30</b>. While the air is discharged out after passing through the dirt-filtering means and the driving chamber, the dust and dirt are filtered and collected by the dirt-filtering means.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, in addition to the function of connecting the dust-collecting chamber of the cleaner body <b>10</b> to the suction brush <b>20</b>, the hose assembly <b>30</b> is also used as an auxiliary brush to clean narrow areas, which are hard to reach by the suction brush <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to be used as the auxiliary brush, the hose assembly <b>30</b> includes a flexible hose <b>31</b> having one end connected to the dust-collecting chamber of the cleaner body <b>10</b>, and a hose holder <b>32</b> connected to the other end of the flexible hose <b>31</b>. The hose holder <b>32</b> is removably connected to a connection part <b>21</b> disposed adjacent the suction brush <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">That is, to use the hose holder <b>32</b> of the hose assembly <b>30</b>, it is separated from the connection part <b>21</b> in order to clean in a narrow area, and after the narrow area has been cleaned, the hose holder <b>32</b> is re-connected to the connection part <b>21</b> in order for the suction brush <b>20</b> to clean a large area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in a conventional upright type vacuum cleaner as described above, the hose assembly <b>30</b> is positioned on a rear portion of the cleaner body <b>10</b> and there are many parts surrounding the hose assembly <b>30</b>. Therefore, it is difficult and inconvenient to connect and disconnect the hose holder <b>32</b> of the hose assembly <b>30</b> with respect to the connection part <b>21</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been developed in order to solve the problems mentioned above. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide a hose connection assembly for a vacuum cleaner having a handle enabling easy connection and disconnection of the hose connection assembly, and an upright type vacuum cleaner having the same.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above aspect is achieved by providing a hose connection assembly for a vacuum cleaner, which is disposed between a dust-collecting chamber of a cleaner body and a connection part of a suction brush, the hose connection assembly comprising a flexible hose having one end connected to the dust-collecting chamber, a hose holder connected to the other end of the flexible hose and being removably connected to the connection part of the suction brush, and a handle mounted on the hose holder to assist in connecting and disconnecting the hose holder with respect to the connection part.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A mounting portion having a bead, preferably a circumferential bead, is formed on an outer circumference of the hose holder to mount the handle therein, and the handle is rotatably mounted on the mounting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The handle comprises a fixing portion shaped as a cylinder and is mounted on the mounting portion, with a holding portion protruding from one side of the fixing portion in a perpendicular direction, and the fixing portion has a larger diameter than that of the mounting portion, thereby providing the ability to rotate about the mounting portion through 360°.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The bead has a diameter difference relative to the cylindrical surface of the mounting portion that is larger than a gap formed by the diameter difference between the mounting portion and the fixing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also, one circumferential bead may be formed along an outer circumference of the mounting portion in an annular pattern, and a plurality of circumferential beads may be formed along an outer circumference of the mounting portion at predetermined intervals from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The holding portion is provided with a protrusion to prevent slipping when a user holds the holding portion, and in this case, it is preferred that the protrusion is formed on a lower surface of the holding portion.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Meanwhile, the above aspect is also achieved by providing an upright type vacuum cleaner comprising a cleaner body having a dust-collecting chamber and a driving chamber, each being divided by a partition, a suction brush disposed below the cleaner body and having a connection part to form a flow channel to the dust-collecting chamber; and a hose connection assembly interposed between the dust-collecting chamber and the connection part. The hose connection assembly comprises a flexible hose having one end connected to the dust-collecting chamber, a hose holder connected to the other end of the flexible hose and separately connected to the connection part, and a handle mounted on the hose holder to assist in connecting and disconnecting the hose holder with respect to the connecting portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an upright type vacuum cleaner according to the present invention includes a cleaner body <b>100</b>, a suction brush <b>200</b>, and a hose connection assembly <b>300</b>, similar to that of the conventional vacuum cleaner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Albeit not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>3</b>, the cleaner body <b>100</b> has a dust-collecting chamber and a driving chamber formed therein, which are divided by a partition. The dust-collecting chamber is provided with dirt-filtering means such as a paper filter, and the driving chamber is provided with a vacuum-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The suction brush <b>200</b> is disposed below the cleaner body <b>100</b>, and has a connection part <b>210</b> formed at one side thereof to be connected to the hose connection assembly <b>300</b> and thereby form a suction flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The hose connection assembly <b>300</b> connects the connection part <b>210</b> of the suction brush <b>200</b> to the dust-collecting chamber of the cleaner body <b>100</b>, thereby forming the suction flow channel connecting the suction brush to the dust-collecting chamber of the cleaner body <b>100</b>. Also, the hose connection assembly <b>300</b> may be used as an auxiliary brush to clean in a narrow area, such as a corner or a window frame, which is hard to reach by the suction brush <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The hose connection assembly <b>300</b> includes a flexible hose <b>310</b>, a hose holder <b>320</b>, and a handle <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flexible hose <b>310</b> has one end connected to the dust-collecting chamber of the cleaner body <b>100</b> and the other end connected to the hose holder <b>320</b>. The hose holder <b>320</b> is removably connected to the connection part <b>210</b> of the suction brush <b>200</b>. That is, the hose holder <b>320</b> is connected to the connection part <b>210</b> in order to clean a surface when using the suction brush <b>200</b>, and is separated from the connection part <b>210</b> when it is to be used as the auxiliary brush.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Meanwhile, the handle <b>330</b>, which is one of the main features of the present invention, is disposed on the hose holder <b>320</b> to assist in connecting or disconnecting the hose holder <b>320</b> with respect to the connection part <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, the hose holder <b>320</b> is provided with a mounting portion <b>340</b> having a circumferential bead <b>341</b> formed along an outer circumference of the hose holder <b>320</b>, for mounting the handle <b>330</b> therein, and the handle <b>330</b> is rotatably mounted on the mounting portion <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The handle <b>330</b> includes a fixing portion <b>331</b> shaped as a hollow cylinder, mounted on the mounting portion <b>340</b>, and a holding portion <b>332</b>, protruding from one side of the fixing portion <b>331</b> in a perpendicular direction. Preferably, the fixing portion <b>331</b> has a diameter larger than that of the mounting portion <b>340</b> to permit rotation completely about the mounting portion <b>340</b> through 360°.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also, the circumferential bead <b>341</b> has a diameter difference to the cylindrical surface of the mounting portion that is larger than a predetermined gap formed by the diameter difference between the mounting portion <b>340</b> and the fixing portion <b>331</b>. Due to the presence of the circumferential bead <b>341</b>, the handle <b>330</b> rotatably mounted on the mounting portion <b>340</b> can be prevented from deviating from the mounting portion <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, one circumferential bead <b>341</b> is formed along the outer circumference of the mounting portion <b>340</b> in an annular pattern. However, this should not be considered as limiting. A plurality of circumferential bead sections <b>341</b>′ may be formed along the outer circumference of the mounting portion at predetermined intervals from each other, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also, the holding portion <b>332</b> is provided with a protrusion <b>332</b><i>a </i>provided for preventing slipping of a user's hold when a user holds the holding portion <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of hose connection assembly of the vacuum cleaner, which in most respects is similar to that of the hose connection assembly <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with the exception of the circumferential bead <b>341</b> that circumscribes the mounting portion <b>340</b>. Whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the circumferential bead <b>341</b> is a continuous band, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, mounting portion <b>340</b>′ includes a plurality of circumferential bead sections <b>341</b>′ which are disposed in a circumferential pattern at discrete intervals from each other, with gaps between adjacent ones of the circumferential bead sections <b>341</b>′, as shown. Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the handle <b>330</b> of hose connection assembly <b>300</b> remains identical to that of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and thus the identifying numerals are identical.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The upright-type vacuum cleaner having the hose connection assembly <b>300</b> with the above construction performs a cleaning operation for a relatively large area using the suction brush <b>200</b> with the hose holder <b>320</b> of the hose connection assembly <b>300</b> being connected to the connection part <b>210</b> of the suction brush <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Meanwhile, in order to clean a narrow area that is hard to reach by the suction brush <b>200</b>, the hose holder <b>320</b> is separated from the connection part <b>210</b> so that the hose connection assembly <b>300</b> may be used as the auxiliary brush.</p>
