<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An undulating mixing device for precise, controlled agitation of sensitive biological and chemical solutions provides a base and a platform connected by four flexible connectors, a spring loaded motor mount assembly pivotally attaching a motor to the base, a turntable rotatably attached to the base, a tilt assembly pivotally and rotationally attached to the turntable and rigidly affixed to the platform, and a motor shaft that engages a groove on the turntable for causing rotation thereof. The tilt assembly includes an adjustable collar which controls the tilt or yaw movement of the platform as the motor effects rotation of the turntable. A selectively adjustable speed control switch sets the desired rotational speed of the motor via a microprocessor. The device functions without modification on a plurality of selected voltages and frequencies for achieving the desired rotational speed.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention herein pertains to an undulating mixing device and a method for agitating various solutions in a laboratory environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART AND OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lab technicians frequently have to agitate, stir or blend very delicate solutions in a smooth fashion without the introduction of bubbles or froth where vigorous agitation may ruin the samples, such as during protein, DNA and RNA staining operations and processes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, several devices have been promoted which gently agitate solutions for use in laboratory environments and automate tedious procedures. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,702,610; 4,893,938; and 5,423,603, are examples of devices that utilize a gentle vertical agitation for solutions having components with different specific gravities in order to prevent layers from forming which may inhibit the completion of a desired chemical reaction. A mixing device having a small footprint, a selectively tiltable platform, and manual speed control, such as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,921,676, addresses the two main problems including (1) a relatively large footprint that limits the number of devices that may fit in controlled laboratory environments, such as in an incubator or a refrigerated unit, and (2) a predetermined degree of tilt between the platform and the base that remains fixed during agitation which may be too pronounced or too little for specific mixing requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Not addressed by these prior devices is the increased possibility of contamination of very delicate solutions from the mechanical operation such as dust and arcing created by a brush motor along with undesired vibration and noise. Such contamination may lead to undesired results or inadvertent reactions with the delicate solution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional problems associated with prior mixing devices involve speed control. First, prior devices utilizing mechanical gears to effect adjustment to the mixing rate are more likely to introduce undesired contaminants and vibration, but are limited to pre-set gear ratios with a speed control. The problems associated with pre-set speed adjustments is they usually do not compensate for the possible varying mass and inertia generated by different load sizes, shapes and placements. Accordingly, the agitation rates of subsequent loads set to the same speed may differ from that of a prior load despite having the same speed control setting. The different actual agitation rates may cause undesired results and variations of the sample solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, with the above concerns in mind, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a laboratory mixing device with an electronically commutated brushless motor to prevent arcing, possible contamination, and vibration associated with a non-brushless motor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another objective of the present invention to provide a laboratory mixing device that monitors and adjusts the actual motor rotational speed to a speed desired by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a laboratory mixing device that effects rotation of a turntable via a friction ring within a groove on the turntable for smooth, positive movement.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a laboratory mixing device that will automatically adjust the input voltages to accommodate domestic 120 VAC and foreign 250 VAC environments at 60 Hz and 50 Hz without circuitry reconfiguration.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is still a further objective of the present invention to provide a laboratory mixing device which is compact, durable and can be cost effective to produce and operate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another objective of the present invention to provide a laboratory mixing device that has low heat contribution to special environments such as incubators and refrigerators.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various other objectives and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art as a more detailed description is set forth below.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The aforesaid and other objectives are realized by providing a mixing device and method for precise, selectively controlled agitation of sensitive biological and chemical solutions in a laboratory environment through electronic commutation of a brushless DC motor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The preferred mixing device includes a drive mechanism attached to a base. The drive mechanism includes a brushless DC motor with a vertical motor shaft having a friction ring affixed in a groove thereon, a motor mount assembly for pivotally attaching the motor to the base, a turntable with a central shaft rotationally attached to the base and rotated by the motor shaft engaging, a platform, a tilt assembly pivotally attached to the turntable that is rotatable thereunder and rigidly affixed to the platform thereabove, electrical circuitry including a pair of circuit boards with a microprocessor in electrical communication with the motor for managing the power supplied thereto and the speed thereof, and a potentiometer serving as a manually adjustable incremental speed control switch through rotation of its shaft. The base is connected to the platform by a plurality of flexible connectors and the tilt assembly. Selective electronic activation of the drive mechanism induces rotation of the turntable which carries the tilt assembly about the turntable shaft and while the fluctuating compressive and tensile forces on the flexible connectors allow the platform to tilt or yaw during rotation as the tilt assembly pivots back and forth above the turntable.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">While the base includes a planar portion and a housing, the platform is preferably a rigid material in a generally planar shape. A commercially available rubberized non-slip pad can be placed on top of the platform to increase frictional engagement therewith and to prevent the sliding of beakers, dishes, or other containers. While an X-shape is preferred for the housing, other shapes that form corners allowing the flexible connectors to attach thereon to the planar base portion are also contemplated. The flexible connectors are preferably a flexible polyvinyl chloride tubing although other standard flexible connectors of either polymeric, natural or other spring materials are contemplated. The turntable is preferably a rigid disk that defines a circular groove with an outer wall and an oval pivot channel and is driven by a motor shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pair of circuit boards are affixed to the planar base portion and comprise a power control circuit board for converting and regulating the power supply that is in electrical communication with a motor control circuit board for managing the speed of the motor. Functions of these circuit boards may be combined into one board or further distributed to additional boards. The mixing device can accommodate both domestic 120 VAC and foreign 250 VAC at 60 Hz and 50 Hz without modification and remains in a powered “on” state when in electrical communication with an adequate power source.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The motor mount assembly includes an arm that is rigidly attached to the motor, a shaft that is rotationally attached to the planar base portion, and a spring which links the arm to the planar base portion whereby pivoting the arm inwardly stretches the spring and moves the attached motor arcuately above and across the planar base portion. Pivoting the motor mount arm inward allows the turntable groove to receive the motor shaft while the recoil forces of the stretched spring maintain contact between the friction ring and the turntable groove outer wall.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tilt assembly is a multi-component unit which includes a pivot shaft having a pivot slot that receives a connecting rod that is affixed to the turntable, a collar, a ball bearing that is pressure fitted on the pivot shaft and is rigidly attached to the collar which allows the collar to rotate freely about the pivot shaft, a threaded post that is surrounded by the collar, and an internal spring which rests on the floor of the collar and abuts the interior surface of the threaded post to prevent any drift thereof during rotation. The tilt assembly is pivotable on the connecting rod affixed to the turntable in the turntable pivot channel. The threaded post is rigidly affixed to the center of the platform thereby the tilt assembly links the platform to the turntable such that selective manual clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the collar either raises or lowers the threaded post therein and thus changes the distance between the platform and the base whereby an increase in distance decreases the possible pitch and yaw of the platform and therefore allows for selective adjustment of the vertical agitation induced into the solution thereon during use of the mixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The motor is controlled by a microprocessor on the motor control circuit board possessing pulse-width modulation (“PWM”) module with application software-implemented functions that provides (1) a compensated feedback algorithm to effect precise speed control including compensation of the effects of mechanical inertia and loading, and (2) a virtual power switch that eliminates routing line voltage carrying conductors to a combination potentiometer-switch assembly which keeps voltage low. The microprocessor compares the input voltage received from the potentiometer, which is a digital representation of the angular position of its shaft and the selected speed of the motor, and the feedback voltage from the Hall-effect sensor array, which is a digital representation of the motor shaft speed as each sensor provides the instantaneous angular position of the motor shaft in relation to each phase of the stator windings, to a table of speed equivalent voltages pre-programmed in the microprocessor and determines the appropriate change in motor shaft speed direction and magnitude. The microprocessor implements a change in motor speed by sending output voltage to the motor through the PWM module which regulates the frequency and duration of the output voltage sent to the motor's phased stator windings for electronic commutation of the motor. In order to provide smooth and gradual speed transitions, the microprocessor directs stepped speed adjustments in the direction of the selected motor speed whereby the magnitude of each step is limited by a pre-programmed maximum increment or decrease in motor speed. The microprocessor continues to monitor instantaneous motor shaft speed and direct appropriate successive stepped gradual changes therein to achieve and maintain the selected speed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The preferred method of mixing closely follows the function of the device described herein. To begin mixing with the device, the mixing device must first be in electrical communication with an electric power source though a standard electric power cord. Prior to connecting the device to a power source, the potentiometer shaft should be placed in a fully counter-clockwise position to prevent undesired movement of the platform and the desired range of vertical agitation should be set by selective manual counter-clockwise or clockwise rotation of the tilt assembly collar. Upon connection to the power source, the line operated switch-mode power supply circuit on the power control circuit board cleans the potentially poorly regulated and unstable plurality of electric currents and voltages supplied to the mixing device and converts the current into +12 VDC which is supplied to the motor control circuit board. The voltage sub-regulator circuit contained on the motor control circuit board converts the +12 VDC received into constant and precise +5 VDC to drive the microprocessor on the motor control circuit board which manages the motor speed. With power supplied to the microprocessor, the mixing device is in a powered “on” state and able to mix solutions placed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Rotating the potentiometer shaft clockwise from a fully counter-clockwise position increases the voltage sent to the microprocessor from a ground baseline voltage whereby the potentiometer voltage digitally represents the angular position of the potentiometer shaft and the selected motor shaft speed. Provided the voltage received from the potentiometer exceeds a pre-programmed threshold voltage, the microprocessor sends output voltage to illuminate an LED proximate the potentiometer on the base to indicate a virtual “on” state until the voltage received drops below the threshold voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The microprocessor compares the voltage input from the potentiometer and the feedback voltage from the Hall-effect sensor array to a pre-programmed table of speed equivalent voltages and determines how the motor shaft speed needs to be adjusted. The microprocessor instructs the PWM module to effect the appropriate change in commutation limited in scope by the maximum incremental step whereby the PWM module regulates the frequency and duration of the voltage sent to the motor's phased stator windings and adjusts the speed of the motor shaft towards that of the selected speed. The microprocessor continues to monitor and manage the motor shaft speed and directs the appropriate step towards achieving and maintaining the selected speed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Once the microprocessor receives input voltage from the potentiometer that exceeds the threshold power “on” voltage, the microprocessor directs the electronic commutation of the motor and the motor starts to spin. The motor shaft and the friction ring preferably rotate at the same rate. Rotation of the friction ring imparts a tangential force on turntable groove outer wall which causes the turntable to rotate about its central axis on the turntable shaft. The rotating turntable carries the tilt assembly and the attached platform about the turntable shaft whereby the tilt assembly allows the attached platform to trace a non-rotational orbit above the base as the pivot shaft rotates within the ball bearing. The platform orbiting above the base changes the tension and compression forces placed on the flexible connectors which affects their degree of straightness and causes the tilt assembly to pivot on the connecting rod and wobble back and forth in turntable pivot channel whereby the platform tilts or yaws in relation to the movement of the tilt assembly. The movement of the platform provides both vertical and horizontal agitation of the solutions placed thereon. As the potentiometer shaft is manually selectively rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise to adjust the desired agitation rate, the degree of vertical and horizontal movement of the platform increases or decreases respectively. Agitation will continue until the voltage input to the microprocessor drops below the pre-programmed threshold voltage.</p>

When motor shaft <b>22</b> is rotated by motor <b>51</b>, friction ring <b>81</b> preferably rotates without slippage on motor shaft <b>22</b> and against turntable outer groove wall <b>84</b> which imparts a frictional force (not shown) thereon that is substantially tangential to the central axis of turntable <b>70</b> whereby turntable <b>70</b> is driven to revolve around its central axis along vertical shaft <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As turntable <b>70</b> is rotated, tilt assembly <b>20</b> pivots in pivot channel <b>73</b> thereby causing collar <b>23</b> to rotate thus rotating platform <b>12</b> therewith. This movement causes platform <b>12</b> to circumscribe an eccentric orbit over base <b>11</b> since the center of platform <b>12</b> is not directly above the center of base <b>11</b>. Threaded post <b>41</b> can be manually raised and lowered within collar <b>23</b>, thus changing the distance between platform <b>12</b> and base <b>11</b>. Since tilt assembly <b>20</b> is rotating, threaded post <b>41</b> has a tendency to “drift” downwardly on the internal threads of collar <b>23</b>, thus changing the positioning of platform <b>12</b>. The coil spring (not seen) in tilt assembly <b>20</b> is tensioned between collar <b>23</b> and threaded post <b>41</b> and corrects this “drifting” by biasing threaded post <b>41</b> so that threaded post <b>41</b> does not rotate downwardly within collar <b>23</b> as turntable <b>70</b> moves in its circular path. As threaded post <b>41</b> is lowered within collar <b>23</b>, more tension is put upon the coil spring (not shown) of tilt assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ability to raise and lower threaded post <b>41</b> and platform <b>12</b> is impacted by the shape and positioning of tubular flexible connectors <b>13</b>. When platform <b>12</b> is raised to the maximum, flexible connectors <b>13</b> are generally straight and undistorted. When turntable <b>70</b> is rotated and tilt assembly <b>20</b> swings platform <b>12</b> in its orbit over base <b>11</b>, each arm remains essentially straight and platform <b>12</b> remains level. Thus, a biological/chemical solution can be mixed via a horizontal swirling motion with little or no vertical agitation. However, when platform <b>12</b> is lowered, flexible connectors <b>13</b> are distorted and compressed into non-linear shapes. As platform <b>12</b> is rotated, each flexible connector <b>13</b> in turn is straightened. The corresponding corner of platform <b>12</b> is raised to its highest point above base <b>11</b> when its flexible connector <b>13</b> is straight. The remaining corners of platform <b>12</b> are in varying degrees of straightness closer to base <b>11</b>, with the opposite corner generally being the lowest position. Flexible connectors <b>13</b> associated with these lowered corners are distorted into non-linear shapes, the amount of distortion being generally inversely proportional to the height of the corresponding corner above base <b>11</b>. The lower platform <b>12</b> is selectively positioned, the greater the tilt thereof. Thus, manual rotation of collar <b>23</b> raises and lowers platform <b>12</b> to allow selection of the degree of tilt of platform <b>12</b>. The tilting of platform <b>12</b> along with the orbital path that platform <b>12</b> circumscribes causes both horizontal and vertical agitation of solutions placed thereon. Therefore, selective adjustment to the degree of tilt of platform <b>12</b> allows the choice of the vertical agitation induced into the solution during use of mixing device <b>10</b>. A commercially available rubberized non-slip pad (not shown), preferably a resilient polymeric material having an irregular surface, can be placed on the top of platform <b>12</b> so as to provide additional frictional engagement and prevent items such as beakers, dishes or other containers (not shown) from sliding along tilted platform <b>12</b>.</p>
