<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to methods and mechanisms for preventing failures in an inkjet print cartridge. More specifically, the present invention relates to a venting mechanism used to prepare inkjet print cartridges for periods of inactivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Inkjet print cartridges typically use inks that include a volatile solvent such as alcohol and/or water. Where inkjet print cartridges remain inactive for long periods, as when the print cartridge is in transit to an end user, is in storage, or where the printer in which the print cartridge is installed is not used for long periods, the solvents in the inks will begin to evaporate. This evaporation is especially problematic in the area of the nozzles of the print cartridge as the evaporating solvents leave behind solid deposits of pigments and the like that can occlude the nozzles, thereby rending the print cartridge inoperative and/or can reduce the print quality thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many steps have been taken to prevent the evaporation of ink solvents from a print cartridge, with the aim of preventing occlusions of the print cartridge nozzle. One solution has been to apply tape over the print cartridge nozzles. While this solution does reduce evaporation of solvents from the ink in the print cartridge, it does not prevent all such evaporation. Furthermore, the use of tape over the nozzles of the printhead is typically useful only prior to the installation of the print cartridge in a printer; a user cannot easily reapply tape over the nozzles of the print cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another solution is to provide a pumping mechanism that can remove ink from the print cartridge, or at least from the region of the print cartridge adjacent the nozzles thereof; the idea being that where there is no ink, there can be no evaporation and the incidence of occlusions will decrease. However, such systems are complicated and in any case, it has been difficult to remove all ink from the region of the print cartridge adjacent to the nozzles thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for a method and a mechanism that will facilitate the removal of ink from the region of a print cartridge adjacent to the nozzles thereof where the print cartridge will remain inactive for a time. In addition, there is a need for a mechanism that can prime a print cartridge in which ink has been removed from the region of the print cartridge adjacent the nozzles so that the print cartridge may begin or resume printing.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates schematically one embodiment of a print cartridge <b>10</b>. Print cartridge <b>10</b> has one or more reservoirs <b>12</b> that are fluidically coupled to a standpipe <b>14</b> by coupling <b>16</b>. Standpipe <b>14</b> has a printhead <b>18</b> that is adapted for dispensing ink from the standpipe <b>14</b> in an inkjet printing process of a type known in the art. As ink is expelled from one or more nozzles <b>17</b> the printhead <b>18</b>, a vacuum is generated in the standpipe <b>14</b> that acts to draw ink from reservoir <b>12</b> into the standpipe <b>14</b> through coupling <b>16</b>. As used herein, the term vacuum pressure is used to designate a reduced pressure that is generally lower than a reference pressure, which in one embodiment is atmospheric pressure, and in another embodiment is a source of pressurized air or other fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, coupling <b>16</b> is a passage or conduit having a check valve or filter installed therein for controlling the flow of ink from reservoir <b>12</b> to standpipe <b>14</b>. That is, a vacuum within the standpipe <b>14</b> will act to draw ink through the coupling <b>16</b>. However, absent a sufficiently large pressure differential, ink will not generally flow freely through the coupling <b>16</b> from the reservoir to the standpipe <b>14</b>, though a nominal amount of ink may continue to flow. In one embodiment, the check valve will be selected such that the surface tension of ink and its solvents on the check valve will prevent the flow of ink therethrough where there is air or another similar fluid present on one side of the check valve, such as where all ink has been removed from the standpipe <b>14</b> and the standpipe <b>14</b> contains only air.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As ink is drawn from the reservoir <b>12</b> and into standpipe <b>14</b>, a vacuum is generated within the reservoir <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the vacuum in reservoir <b>12</b> acts to draw additional ink from an auxiliary or supplemental reservoir <b>24</b> that is fluidically connected to the reservoir <b>12</b> by conduit <b>22</b>. In another embodiment, a pumping mechanism <b>20</b> actively pumps ink from reservoir <b>24</b> into reservoir <b>12</b> to replenish the ink ejected by the printhead <b>18</b>. Pumping mechanism <b>20</b> includes a motor <b>26</b> that is coupled to a pump <b>28</b>. The pumping mechanism <b>20</b> may be manually actuated when the print cartridge <b>10</b> is determined to be out of ink or when it is determined that the level of ink in the reservoir <b>12</b> is below a predetermined minimum. Alternatively, the vacuum in the reservoir <b>12</b> may be sensed by a sensor (not shown) whose output actuates the pumping mechanism <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Where a print cartridge <b>10</b> is to remain unused for an extended period of time, the print cartridge <b>10</b> may be de-primed, i.e. ink may be removed from the standpipe <b>14</b> and the printhead <b>18</b> to prevent the clogging of the nozzles <b>17</b> of the printhead <b>18</b> and subsequent malfunctions of the print cartridge <b>10</b> that may arise therefrom. The print cartridge <b>10</b> is de-primed by coupling the standpipe <b>14</b> to pressures higher than those present in the reservoir <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, a snorkel <b>30</b> is fluidically coupled to standpipe <b>14</b> by a conduit <b>32</b>. Snorkel <b>30</b> is in turn fluidically coupled to a valve mechanism <b>34</b> by conduit <b>36</b>. The valve mechanism <b>34</b> is adapted to selectively connect the snorkel <b>30</b> to atmospheric air, which is at a generally higher pressure than the vacuum within the reservoir <b>12</b> and standpipe <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the valve mechanism <b>34</b> may connect the snorkel <b>30</b> to a source of high-pressure air <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As described above, the act of ejecting ink from the printhead <b>18</b> during printing generates a vacuum within the volume of the standpipe <b>14</b>. This vacuum in turn draws ink from the reservoir <b>12</b> into the standpipe <b>14</b>, thereby giving rise to a vacuum within the reservoir <b>12</b>. Introducing to the standpipe <b>14</b> a higher pressure by coupling the snorkel <b>30</b> to the atmosphere or to a source of higher pressure creates a pressure differential that acts to force ink from the standpipe <b>14</b> through the conduit <b>16</b> and back into the reservoir <b>12</b>. When the air or other gas introduced into the standpipe <b>14</b> contacts the check valve or filter, ink is substantially prevented from flowing into the standpipe <b>14</b> from the reservoir <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, a wiper <b>36</b> may be simultaneously employed to prevent clogging of the nozzles <b>17</b> of the printhead <b>18</b>. Wiper <b>36</b> moves laterally with respect to the print cartridge <b>10</b> such that the tips <b>38</b> of the wiper <b>36</b> are drawn across the surface of the printhead <b>18</b>. The wiping action of the tips <b>38</b> against the printhead <b>18</b> acts to remove excess liquid ink and/or accretions formed around or in the nozzles <b>17</b> of the printhead <b>18</b>. In another embodiment, the wiper <b>36</b> may be provided with a wick <b>40</b> that dispenses a non-volatile material that, when applied to the printhead <b>18</b>, prevents ink in the nozzles <b>17</b> from drying out and also prevents the ingress of air into the print cartridge <b>10</b> through the printhead <b>18</b>. As wiper <b>36</b> moves laterally, the tips <b>38</b> of the wiper <b>36</b> are drawn across the wick <b>40</b> and a small amount of the non-volatile material is deposited thereon. The non-volatile material is then applied to the printhead <b>18</b> by the tips <b>38</b> of the wiper <b>36</b>. In one embodiment, the non-volatile material remains relatively viscous and does not cure or harden to any significant degree. In this manner, re-priming of the print cartridge <b>10</b> is not impeded by accretions of the non-volatile material within the nozzles <b>17</b> of the printhead.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Re-priming of the print cartridge <b>10</b> in preparation for printing operations after a period of inactivity involves filling the standpipe <b>14</b> with ink. In one embodiment, the pumping mechanism <b>20</b> is activated to pump ink into the reservoir <b>12</b> under sufficient pressure to force ink through conduit <b>16</b> and into the standpipe <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the valve mechanism <b>34</b> may be actuated to couple the supplemental reservoir <b>24</b> directly to the standpipe <b>14</b> such that the pumping mechanism <b>20</b> can pump ink directly into the standpipe <b>14</b> as through conduit <b>36</b>. In another embodiment, the pumping mechanism <b>20</b> may be coupled to the snorkel <b>30</b>. Thereafter, ink and/or air within the snorkel <b>30</b> and standpipe <b>14</b> is withdrawn by the pumping mechanism <b>20</b> to generate a vacuum therein, thereby drawing ink into the standpipe <b>14</b> from the reservoir <b>12</b> for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to priming and de-priming the print cartridge, the supplemental reservoir <b>24</b> and pumping mechanism <b>20</b>, may also be used to supply ink to one or more print cartridges <b>10</b> to replenish the reservoir <b>12</b> during printing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a close-up cross-sectional view of an exemplary printhead assembly <b>100</b> according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows only the components corresponding to a single reservoir <b>102</b> for a single color, though it is understood that printhead assembly <b>100</b> may be adapted to include multiple reservoirs, one for each color printable by a printing system. Conduit <b>104</b> is connected to printhead inlet port <b>106</b> to provide fluid communication between the off-axis ink supply container <b>108</b> and the printhead assembly <b>100</b>. Inlet port <b>106</b> may have a valve mechanism (not shown) associated therewith to control the flow of ink from an off-axis ink supply container <b>108</b> to the reservoir <b>102</b>. Ink flows into reservoir <b>102</b> through fluid channel <b>110</b> from conduit <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, reservoir <b>102</b> includes an accumulator bag <b>112</b> and spring <b>114</b> along with a bubbler <b>116</b> to maintain a slight negative pressure in the reservoir <b>102</b>, as is known in the art. Where ink and/or air is withdrawn from the reservoir <b>102</b> through port <b>106</b>, the accumulator bag <b>112</b> expands by drawing air through port <b>111</b>. Spring <b>114</b> and bubbler <b>116</b> cooperate to ensure that as ink and/or air is withdrawn from reservoir <b>102</b>, the accumulator bag <b>112</b> does not over inflate. Spring <b>114</b> resists pressure from the accumulator bag <b>112</b> as it inflates. Bubbler <b>116</b> includes a diaphragm or valve element that allows air to enter the reservoir <b>102</b> from the exterior, thereby limiting the reduction of pressure within the reservoir <b>102</b> to a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A particle filter <b>118</b> separates the reservoir <b>102</b> from the lower body portion <b>120</b> of the print head assembly <b>100</b>. As needed, ink may flow through particle filter <b>118</b> into inlet channel <b>122</b> and ultimately into plenum or standpipe <b>124</b>, which resides directly above a slot (not shown). The slot ultimately feeds a thermal printing device (not shown), which ejects ink through nozzles <b>125</b> disposed in the bottom side <b>126</b> of the lower body portion <b>120</b> of the printhead assembly <b>100</b>, according to methods known in the art. The standpipe <b>124</b> is also fluidically connected to a port <b>128</b> via a flow path, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as having a channel <b>130</b>, a conduit <b>132</b> and an outlet <b>134</b>. Channel <b>130</b>, conduit <b>132</b> and outlet <b>134</b> may all be generically and collectively referred to herein as a snorkel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, ports <b>106</b> and <b>128</b> are fluidically connected to valve mechanism <b>140</b> by conduits <b>104</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively. Note that in other embodiments, ports <b>106</b> and <b>128</b> may be connected to separate valve mechanisms or the like. Valve mechanism <b>140</b> is adapted to selectively couple the off-axis ink supply container <b>108</b> to the reservoir <b>102</b>. In addition, the valve mechanism <b>140</b> may couple the snorkel to the atmosphere or to a supply of relatively high pressure air <b>141</b>. In another embodiment, valve mechanism <b>140</b> may include multiple valves connected to one another to effect the various connections described herein in a manner known to those skilled in the art. Coupled between the valve mechanism <b>140</b> and the off-axis ink supply container <b>108</b> is a pumping mechanism <b>146</b> that includes a pump <b>148</b> that is powered by motor <b>150</b>. In another embodiment, pumping mechanism <b>146</b> may be omitted in favor of a gravity flow or vacuum operated system. The printhead assembly <b>100</b> may optionally be provided with a wiper <b>160</b> and wick <b>162</b> that function as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Where there exists a vacuum within the reservoir <b>102</b>, inlet channel <b>122</b>, and standpipe <b>124</b>, or where there exists a source of pressure higher than that within the reservoir <b>102</b>, inlet channel <b>122</b>, and standpipe <b>124</b>, de-priming the printhead assembly <b>100</b> involves actuating valve mechanism <b>140</b> to couple the snorkel to atmospheric air or to a supply of air at a pressure greater than that present in the reservoir <b>102</b>, inlet channel <b>122</b> and standpipe <b>124</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> at <b>200</b>. The relatively higher pressure introduced into the snorkel through port <b>128</b> forces ink within the snorkel, standpipe <b>124</b>, and inlet channel <b>122</b> back into the reservoir <b>102</b> through particle filter <b>118</b>. When air contacts the particle filter <b>118</b>, the surface tension of ink in the particle filter <b>118</b> is sufficient to substantially prevent the flow of air therethrough and is further able to substantially prevent the flow of ink from the reservoir <b>102</b> back into the inlet channel <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Where the pressure within the reservoir <b>102</b> and the lower body portion <b>120</b> is higher than or substantially the same as atmospheric pressure, the process of de-priming the printhead assembly <b>100</b> involves a first step of actuating the valve mechanism <b>140</b> to couple the reservoir <b>102</b> to the pumping mechanism <b>146</b> as shown at <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Pumping mechanism <b>146</b> is then actuated to withdrawn ink and/or air from the reservoir <b>102</b>, thereby creating a relatively low pressure or vacuum within the reservoir <b>102</b> as at <b>302</b>. Once there is a relatively low pressure within the reservoir <b>102</b>, pumping mechanism <b>146</b> is shut down (<b>304</b>) and the valve mechanism <b>140</b> is actuated to break the connection between the reservoir <b>102</b> and the pumping mechanism (<b>306</b>). Finally, valve mechanism <b>140</b> is actuated to couple the snorkel to atmospheric air or to a supply of air at a pressure greater than that present in the reservoir <b>102</b>, inlet channel <b>122</b> and standpipe <b>124</b> (<b>308</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once ink has been removed from the region or volume adjacent the nozzles <b>125</b> of the printhead <b>100</b>, wiper <b>160</b> is drawn across the nozzles <b>125</b> of the printhead assembly <b>100</b> to remove external accretions and to apply a non-volatile material obtained from the wick <b>162</b> to the orifice plate in which the nozzles <b>125</b> of the printhead assembly <b>100</b> are formed, thereby preventing the formation of accretions within the nozzles <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An exemplary embodiment of a method of priming the printhead assembly <b>100</b> in preparation for printing is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this embodiment, port <b>128</b> of the printhead assembly <b>100</b> is coupled to the pumping mechanism <b>146</b> by selectively actuating the valve mechanism <b>140</b> as at step <b>400</b>. Thereafter, pumping mechanism <b>146</b> is actuated to draw air, and if any remains, ink, from the snorkel (step <b>402</b>). The withdrawal of air/ink from the snorkel reduces the pressure therein, which subsequently induces ink to flow from the reservoir <b>102</b> through particle filter <b>118</b> into inlet channel <b>122</b> and standpipe <b>124</b>. Once a sufficient pressure differential has been created as between the reservoir <b>102</b> and the lower body portion <b>120</b>, the pumping mechanism <b>146</b> is shut down (step <b>404</b>) and the valve mechanism <b>140</b> is actuated to de-couple port <b>128</b> from the pumping mechanism <b>146</b> (step <b>406</b>). Note that valve mechanism <b>140</b>, upon de-coupling port <b>128</b> from the pumping mechanism <b>146</b>, also seals port <b>128</b> and prevents the ingress or escape of air. An alternate embodiment of the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> involves coupling the off-axis reservoir <b>108</b> to the reservoir <b>102</b> through pumping mechanisms <b>146</b> and actuating pumping mechanism <b>146</b> to pump ink into the reservoir <b>102</b> at a pressure sufficient to force ink into the inlet channel <b>122</b> and standpipe <b>124</b>.</p>
