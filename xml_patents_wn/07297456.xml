<p id="p-0010" num="0008">Illustrated in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 10/144,147, Publication No. 20030211413, now abandoned, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, is a photoconductive imaging member comprised of a supporting substrate, and thereover a single layer comprised of a mixture of a photogenerator component, a charge transport component, an electron transport component, and a polymer binder, and wherein the photogenerating component is a metal free phthalocyanine.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The appropriate components, such as photogenerating pigments, charge transport compounds, optional layers, and processes of the above copending applications may be selected for the present invention in embodiments thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">This invention is generally directed to imaging members, and more specifically, the present invention is directed to single and multi-layered photoconductive imaging members comprised of novel crosslinkable polymers, and which polymers may, for example, be selected for the charge transport layer of the imaging members. More specifically, the present invention relates to crosslinkable hydroxylated polycarbonates, processes thereof, and charge transporting layers thereof. In embodiments thereof, the present invention relates to hydroxyl pendant polycarbonates crosslinked with a functionalized charge transport compound and a curing agent, and charge transport compositions comprised of charge transport compounds/molecules, and a hydroxyl pendant polycarbonate crosslinked with a functionalized charge transport compound and a curing agent. Also, in embodiments the crosslinked charge transport components of a hydroxyl-pendant polycarbonate crosslinked with a functionalized, such as hydroxy, known charge transport, especially hole transport, and a known curing agent can be selected for the charge transport layer of a photoconductive imaging member as the top overcoat protective layer for a photoconductive imaging member, or as a component in the charge transport layer of a photoconductive imaging member. The crosslinked charge transport compositions can be prepared as illustrated herein, such as by reacting a hydroxylated charge transport compound with a curing agent, such as a diisocyanate, in the presence of a solvent to form an isocyanate charge transport coating composition, which can then be blended with a hydroxyl pendant polycarbonate. The resulting coating composition can then be deposited on a photogenerating layer of a photoconductive imaging member and/or the coating composition can be deposited on a charge transport layer, followed by curing in each instance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Moreover, in embodiments of the present invention there is provided a charge transport (CT) composition comprised of charge transport molecules or compounds of, for example, aryl amines, a hydroxylated charge transport compound (CTM) or mixtures thereof, a hydroxyl pendant polycarbonate binder, and a curing agent which reacts with the CTM hydroxy group and polymer binder to form a prepolymer solution on reaction with a suitably functionalized difunctional compound such as a diisocyanate. The resulting composition can be applied or deposited as a charge transport layer in a photoconductive imaging member containing a photogenerating layer, and other known appropriate layers. On thermal curing at elevated temperatures a crosslinked polymeric network having excellent stability in all three dimensional directions is formed. The resulting crosslinked composition, such as, for example, crosslinked at from about 5 percent to about 75 percent, permits wear resistant and extended lifetimes for the photoconductive imaging member. Therefore, the charge transport layer may contain suitable percentages of charge, such as hole transport molecules, with the remainder being the crosslinked compositions illustrated herein, and wherein each of the free charge transport compounds and the functionalized CTM contribute to charge transport. Thus, the amount of free charge transport compounds selected can be reduced without or with only minimum adverse impacts on the electrical performance of the photoconductive imaging members.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">Moreover, in embodiments thereof the present invention imaging members can contain a hole blocking, or undercoat layer (UCL) comprised of, for example, siloxane, such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (γ-APS), a metal oxide, such as titanium oxide, dispersed in a phenolic resin/phenolic resin blend or a phenolic resin/phenolic compound blend, and further wherein this layer is modified by incorporating therein an in situ formed organic/inorganic network, and which network can, for example, enable thicker hole blocking layers and permit excellent, and in embodiments improved electron transporting characteristics by, for example, providing additional electron transporting paths, and which layer can be deposited on a supporting substrate. More specifically, the hole blocking layer usually in contact with the supporting substrate can be situated between the supporting substrate and the photogenerating layer, which is comprised, for example, of the photogenerating pigments of U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,811, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, especially Type V hydroxygallium phthalocyanine, and generally metal free phthalocyanines, metal phthalocyanines, perylenes, titanyl phthalocyanines, hydroxy gallium phthalocyanines, selenium, selenium alloys, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The imaging members of the present invention in embodiments exhibit excellent cyclic/environmental stability, and substantially no adverse changes in their performance over extended time periods; resistance to wear and excellent imaging member lifetimes exceeding, for example, 1,000,000 imaging cycles; excellent and improved electrical characteristics; low and excellent V<sub>low</sub>, that is the surface potential of the imaging member subsequent to a certain light exposure, and which V<sub>low </sub>is, for example, about 20 to about 100 volts lower than, for example, related imaging members free of the crosslinkable polycarbonate illustrated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">The photoresponsive, or photoconductive imaging members can be negatively charged when the photogenerating layers are situated between the hole transport layer and the hole blocking layer deposited on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">Processes of imaging, especially xerographic imaging and printing, including digital, are also encompassed by the present invention. More specifically, the layered photoconductive imaging members of the present invention can be selected for a number of different known imaging and printing processes including, for example, electrophotographic imaging processes, especially xerographic imaging and printing processes wherein charged latent images are rendered visible with toner compositions of an appropriate charge polarity. The imaging members are in embodiments sensitive in the wavelength region of, for example, from about 500 to about 900 nanometers, and in particular from about 650 to about 850 nanometers, thus diode lasers can be selected as the light source. Moreover, the imaging members of this invention are useful in color xerographic applications, particularly high-speed color copying and printing processes.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0076">In a dry 12 liter 3-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, condenser and an addition flask were added 2 liters of fresh tetrahydrofuran under an argon atmosphere. Two grams of LAH were added and the mixture was stirred overnight in order to dry the solvent. After drying, an additional 81.09 grams of lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) were added for a total of 2.19 moles. The resulting bis(phenolic ester (328.2 grams, 1.093 moles)) was dissolved in 3 liters of fresh THF added dropwise over 2 hours during which the reaction mixture became extremely thick, but eventually broke and became freely stirrable. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature, about 25° C., and was quenched by the dropwise addition of 550 milliliters of saturated ammonium chloride solution. The granular aluminum-containing solids resulting were then filtered and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. This afforded 262.5 grams (88.2 percent) of the above valerinol syrupy product sufficient purity for utilization in the next reaction.</p>

The mixture was brought to reflux for 4 hours and then cooled to room temperature, about 25° C. After neutralization with a saturated ammonium chloride solution and drying with brine, the mixture was evaporated to dryness. The resulting residue was combined with 300 milliliters of cyclohexane and brought to reflux for a period of one hour. The hot solvent was carefully decanted and the above process repeated a second time with an equal amount of THF solvent. The gummy residue resulting was taken up in 350 milliliters of ethyl acetate and placed in a suitable separatory funnel. The solution was then extracted with 75 milliliters of 0.25M sodium hydroxide a number of times until extraction of the starting material was confirmed by HPLC.

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">A Photoresponsive Imaging Device was Fabricated as Follows</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0088">On a 75 micron thick titanized MYLAR® substrate was coated by draw bar techniques a barrier layer formed from hydrolyzed gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and which layer was of a thickness of 0.005 micron. The barrier layer coating composition was prepared by mixing 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane with ethanol in a 1:50 volume ratio. The coating was allowed to dry for 5 minutes at room temperature, about 25° C. throughout, followed by curing for 10 minutes at 110° C. in a forced air oven. On top of the blocking layer was coated a 0.05 micron thick adhesive layer prepared from a solution of 2 weight percent of an E.I. DuPont 49K (49,000) polyester in dichloromethane. A 0.2 micron photogenerating layer was then coated on top of the adhesive layer from a dispersion of hydroxy gallium phthalocyanine Type V (0.46 gram) and a polystyrene-b-polyvinylpyridine block copolymer binder (0.48 gram) in 20 grams of toluene, followed by drying at 100° C. for 10 minutes. Subsequently, a 25 micron hole transport layer (CTL) was coated on top of the photogenerating layer from a solution of N,N′-diphenyl-N,N-bis(3-methyl phenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (2.64 grams), and the polymer prepared according to Example VII (3.5 grams), 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (0.088 gram) in 40 grams of dichloromethane. The resulting device or member was dried and cured at 135° C. for 15 minutes to provide an imaging member that exhibited excellent resistance, that is substantially no adverse effects, such as dissolving, in common organic solvents such as, for example, methylenechloride, methanol, or ethanol, and which device was robust and abrasion resistant as determined by a known abrasion test with toner particles.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0089">The xerographic electrical properties of the imaging member can be determined by known means, including electrostatically charging the surfaces thereof with a corona discharge source until the surface potentials, as measured by a capacitively coupled probe attached to an electrometer, attained an initial value V<sub>o </sub>of about −800 volts. After resting for 0.5 second in the dark, the charged members attained a surface potential of V<sub>ddp</sub>, dark development potential. Each member was then exposed to light from a filtered Xenon lamp with a XBO 150 watt bulb, thereby inducing a photodischarge which resulted in a reduction of surface potential to a V<sub>bg </sub>value, background potential. The percent of photodischarge was calculated as 100×(V<sub>ddp</sub>−V<sub>bg</sub>)V<sub>ddp</sub>. The desired wavelength and energy of the exposed light was determined by the type of filters placed in front of the lamp. The monochromatic light photosensitivity was determined using a narrow band-pass filter.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0090">An illustrative wear test on a drum photoreceptor device of the present invention with the above component was accomplished as follows: Photoreceptor wear was determined by the difference in the thickness of the photoreceptor before and after the wear test. For the thickness measurement, the photoreceptor was mounted onto the sample holder to zero the permascope at the uncoated edge of the photoreceptor; the thickness was measured at one-inch intervals from the top edge of the coating along its length using a permascope, ECT-100, to obtain an average thickness value.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0091">The following table summarizes the electrical and the wear test performance of photoconductive members prepared as illustrated above, and wherein CTL represents the charge transport layers; the lower the number, the better and more desirable the wear rate. PCZ is a known polycarbonate binder, and CTL is the charge transport layer.</p>
