<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to internal combustion engines and in particular to four stroke engines sometimes referred to as Otto engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional Otto engine operates in four strokes a) Induction stroke in which the piston moves towards the crankshaft and sucks a mixture of fuel and air into the cylinder through an open inlet valve or valves b) Compression stroke in which the inlet valve(s) close(s) and the mixture is compressed as the piston moves away from the crankshaft, then ignition of the combustible gases followed by c) the power stroke as the piston is pushed down by the expanding gases preforming work, and d) the exhaust stroke as the piston moves away from the crank shaft and the exhaust valve or valves are opened so that the burnt mixture is pushed out of the cylinder. The cylinder is now ready for the next cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many different arrangements of cylinders around a single crank shaft have been proposed. The most conventional engines have multiple pistons arranged in various configurations e.g. in line, in V formation, horizontally opposed to each other, and radially.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In more recent times the moving parts of engines have become lighter which reduces problems due to lack of balance and has allowed the development of high speed (r.p.m.) engines.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,710,767, DE 3921 581 there is disclosed four stroke internal combustion engines which have double acting pistons. By “double acting” is meant pistons performing a power stroke in either direction of movement of the piston. The different engines disclosed have a disadvantage in that their pistons are rigidly fixed to a coaxial piston rod which in turn is connected to the crankshaft through a conventional connecting rod. This produces a larger heavier engine which have more large moving parts and extended sumps.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention seeks to produce internal combustion engines having better power to weight ratio.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">STATEMENTS OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present invention there is provided a four stroke internal combustion engine having at least one cylinder having a double acting piston dividing the cylinder into two combustion chambers and being reciprocable within the cylinder to perform a power stroke producing work on a crankshaft whilst moving towards or away from the crankshaft, the piston being pivotally connected directly to a connecting rod in turn connected directly to the crankshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The piston being connected directly to the crankshaft in the conventional manner allows the use of smaller sumps.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably the connecting rod passes sealingly through a separation plate separating the engine sump from the adjacent combustion chamber, the separation plate accommodating lateral movement of the connecting rod.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some cases the separation plate may move transversely or radially relative to the cylinder to accommodate associated lateral movement of the connecting rod as the piston reciprocates, or alternatively the separation plate may include a slide member that sealingly slides substantially transversely and/or radially of the cylinder axis.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an alternative embodiment, said one chamber may include a sealed portion of the crankshaft housing which in a multi-cylinder. engines is sealed from the sealed portions associated with other respective cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">During the operational cycle of the engine, one of said chambers is one step in advance of the other chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also according to the invention there is provided an internal combustion engine having at least one cylinder with a piston connected directly to a crankshaft by a connecting rod, the piston dividing the cylinder into two combustion chambers so that for each direction of movement the piston can compress an explosive mixture in one of said chambers either side of the piston and one of said chambers includes a sealed portion of the crankshaft housing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above inventions are applicable to all forms of internal combustion Otto cycle/four stroke engine including petrol, diesel, kerosene, hydrocarbon gases or liquids, alcohol and hyrodrogen.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Detailed Description of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown an internal combustion engine <b>110</b> according to the present invention and which is a four stroke engine operable on all conventional fuels e.g petrol, alcohol, fuel oil, hyrocarbon gases, hydrogen etc. The engine <b>110</b> comprises a cylinder block <b>11</b> mounted on a sump <b>12</b>. For the sake of convenience only a single cylinder <b>13</b> is shown but the block <b>11</b> could house any number of cylinders as is desired for a particular engine configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cylinder <b>13</b> is divided into two combustion chambers <b>14</b> &amp; <b>15</b> by a reciprocable piston <b>16</b>. The piston <b>16</b> is a double acting piston and is directly connected to a connecting rod <b>17</b> which sealingly passes through a separation plate <b>18</b> which separates the chamber <b>15</b> from the sump <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term “double acting” means that a power stroke for the engine can be performed in either direction of movement of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The piston <b>16</b> is connected via a pin <b>30</b> to the connecting rod <b>17</b> which in turn connected directly to the crank shaft <b>21</b> in the conventional manner. The lower combustion chamber <b>15</b> is separated from the sump <b>12</b> by a separation plate <b>18</b> which includes an aperture <b>113</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>) to accommodate lateral movement of the rod <b>17</b>. The aperture is closed by a slide portion <b>118</b> which can move radially and/or transversely of separation plate <b>18</b> and is sealed thereto. The rod <b>17</b> will also move vertically in the slide portion <b>118</b> and is sealed therein by seals <b>115</b> to accommodate such movement.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The two chambers <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> on each side of the piston <b>16</b> are each provided with respective inlet valves <b>22</b> <b>23</b>, exhaust valves <b>24</b>,<b>25</b> and spark plugs <b>26</b>,<b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The engine <b>110</b> in this example is an Otto cycle engine which utilizes a single piston <b>16</b> to produce a power stroke in both directions of movement of the piston (i.e towards and away from the crankshaft), which will hereinafter be called a double stroke cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One operational cycle of the two chamber <b>14</b> &amp; <b>15</b> will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Step 1: has the lower chamber <b>15</b> in the compression stroke with the upper chamber <b>14</b> in the induction stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Step 2: has the lower chamber <b>15</b> in the power stroke and the upper chamber <b>14</b> in the compression stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Step 3: has the lower chamber <b>15</b> in the exhaust stroke and the upper chamber <b>14</b> in the power stroke, and</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Step 4: has the lower chamber <b>15</b> in the induction stroke and the upper chamber <b>14</b> in the exhaust stroke .</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cycle then begins again at step 1.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In essence at any stage in the cycle, the stroke in the lower chamber <b>15</b> is repeated in the upper chamber <b>14</b> during the next consecutive stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An alternative operational cycle of the two chambers will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>:</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Step 1 has the lower chamber <b>15</b> in the compression stroke with the upper chamber in the power stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Step 2 has the lower chamber <b>15</b> in the power stroke with the upper chamber in the exhaust stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Step 3 has the lower chamber in the exhaust stroke with the upper chamber <b>14</b> in the induction stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Step 4 has the lower chamber <b>15</b> in the induction stroke with the upper chamber in the compression stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cycle then begins again at step 1. In essence at any stage in the cycle the stroke in the lower chamber <b>15</b> is one step, behind the stroke in the upper chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Any number of cylinders can be incorporated in an engine system, each cylinder using one of the operational cycles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> or <b>3</b>, and in some engine systems some cylinders may operate on one cycle while other cylinders operate simultaneously on the other cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A different sealing arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 and 4A</figref> in which the a pair of spring loaded seals <b>41</b>,<b>42</b> are located in the aperture <b>113</b> in separation plate <b>18</b>. The connecting rod <b>17</b> may bear against the seals, or may contact bearing guides <b>43</b> mounted against the seals <b>41</b> &amp; <b>42</b> respectively. The seals <b>41</b>,<b>42</b> reciprocate in the aperture <b>113</b> to seal around the moving connecting rod.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Yet another construction of engine <b>120</b> according to the present invention, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 &amp; 6</figref>. This engine is similar to the engine <b>110</b> excepting that the lower compression chamber <b>15</b> is includes a portion of the sump <b>12</b> in which valves <b>23</b> &amp; <b>25</b> and spark plug <b>27</b> are located in the wall thereof. Those components present in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be given the same reference numbers. Each lower chamber <b>15</b> extends only into a portion <b>213</b> of the sump with the chamber <b>15</b> sealed by bearings/seals <b>212</b> around the respective portion of the crankshaft <b>21</b>. In a preferred condition, the total extended volume of the chamber <b>15</b> including the respective portion <b>213</b> of the sump equates with the effective working volume of chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The engine should preferably be constructed from materials which withstand high temperatures such as ceramics, titanium, etc. and preferably should have shock and/or explosion resistant bearings in the connecting rod arrangement and/or crankshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Lubrication for the above engines may include the use of self lubricating fuels which may comprise added lubricants.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, or additionally lubrication may be achieved by high pressure lubrication systems pumping lubricant along internal bores in the crankshaft <b>21</b> and rods <b>17</b>,<b>113</b> and associated pins and bearings. Oil may be fed to the peripheral surfaces of the piston from the feed to the piston pin and then through pores open to the cylindrical surface of the piston or holes which open under the piston rings.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The engine may use sleeved cylinders having oil porous walls and oil drainage may be provided for the removal of excess oil.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The use of oil porous metals which are pre-impregnated with oil may be possible for short life engine for example but without limitation, racing engines which are stripped between races.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The oil may also acts as a coolant for the engine.</p>
