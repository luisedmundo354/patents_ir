<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">It is an object of the present invention to provide an optical beam scanning device and an image forming apparatus which suppress displacement of plural images formed by a different photoconductor in a sub-scanning direction by means of a simple structure even if temperature changes. The optical beam scanning device of the present invention has a single light deflecting device, a pre-deflection optical system that allows light beams from a plurality of light sources to enter the light deflecting device, and a post-deflection optical system including a first optical element for imaging reflected light beams from the light deflecting device on surfaces to be scanned for respective light beams. A second optical element, which has a positive or negative power opposite to a power of the first optical element in a sub-scanning direction, is provided in a position of the pre-deflection optical system where the light beams passes commonly and the light beams enter with distance in the sub-scanning direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a laser printer and a digital copying machine, and an optical beam scanning device that can be used in the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, a color image forming apparatus of plural drum type is constituted so that a plurality of images are created on photoconductor drums, the images are overlapped with one another on a recording medium, and one image is formed. The apparatus utilizes a plurality of image forming sections corresponding to separated color components, and an optical beam scanning device (laser exposing device). The optical beam scanning device provides image data corresponding to the color components, namely, a plurality of laser beams to the image forming sections.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such a color image forming apparatus, it is necessary to suitably establish a positional relationship of the images on the photoconductor drums, particularly the positional relationship in a sub-scanning direction in order to realize a color image without color shift (color registration error). A lot of optical elements, however, intervene between light sources and the photoconductor drums, and the optical elements are influenced by ambient temperature and humidity, thereby occasionally causing color shift.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to suppress the color shift in the sub-scanning direction (displacement between the color component images), the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,337,757 is proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this method, pre-deflection optical systems for respective color components, which are provided between light sources for the color components and a deflector shared by the color components, are provided with a hybrid cylinder lens. The hybrid cylinder lens is composed of a glass cylinder lens having a positive power in the sub-scanning direction through which light beams transmit with eccentricity and tilt, and a plastic cylinder lens having a negative power in the sub-scanning direction. As a result, displacement in the sub-scanning direction due to a change in the ambient temperature is suppressed for each color component.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above conventional method, however, the plastic cylinder lens should be provided for each color component (when the color components are yellow, magenta, cyan and black, four plastic cylinder lenses), thereby making the apparatus complicated and expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the hybrid cylinder lens is moved to an optical axial direction for focus adjustment that focuses the beams on image surfaces (surfaces of the photoconductor drums), the hybrid cylinder lens allows the light beams to transmit with eccentricity and tilt. For this reason, emitting positions on the image surfaces (beam positions) are changed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide an optical beam scanning device and an image forming apparatus that are capable of compensating a shift of beam positions of images in a sub-scanning direction caused by a change in use environment by simple structure and suppressing the displacement between the images.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first aspect of the invention is an optical beam scanning device including: a single light deflecting device; a pre-deflection optical system that allows light beams from a plurality of light sources to enter the light deflecting device; and a post-deflection optical system including a first optical element for imaging the reflected light beams from the light deflecting device on surfaces to be scanned for the respective light beams, characterized in that a second optical element having a positive or negative power opposite to a power of the first optical element in a sub-scanning direction is provided in a position of the pre-deflection optical system which allows the light beams from the light sources to pass therethrough and allows the light beams from the light sources to enter in the sub-scanning direction with distance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second aspect of the invention is an optical beam scanning device characterized by including a plurality of optical elements that are arranged on a housing and give a plurality of scanning lines to a plurality of photoconductor with an internal L, wherein linear expansion coefficients of the housing, a frame for locating the photoconductor and a shaft for driving a belt on which images developed on the photoconductor drums are overlapped are designated by αH, αF and αS, respectively, and when an interval between the beams positions on surfaces to be scanned in a sub-scanning direction at the time of developing an optical path reflection from a deflecting surface to the surfaces to be scanned is designated by BP, characteristics of components are selected so that positions of the beams in the sub-scanning direction are shifted only by −(αH−2×αF+αS)×L+αH×BP per unit temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A third aspect of the invention is an optical beam scanning device characterized by including: a single light deflecting device; a pre-deflection optical system that allows light beams from a plurality of light sources to enter the light deflecting device; and a post-deflection optical system including a first optical element for imaging reflecting light beams from the light deflecting device on surfaces to be scanned for respective light beams, wherein characteristics of components including the light deflecting device, the pre-deflection optical system and the post-deflection optical system are selected so that intervals of the light beams from the light sources on the surfaces to be scanned at the time of developing an optical path reflection from a deflecting surface to the surfaces to be scanned become small when temperature rises.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the optical beam scanning device and the image forming apparatus of the present invention, even when ambient environment such as temperature changes, displacement of the images formed by different photoconductor drums in the sub-scanning direction can be suppressed by a simple structure.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the multi-beam optical scanning device <b>1</b> has only one light deflecting device <b>5</b> as a deflecting unit that deflects the laser beams emitted from laser elements as light sources towards image surfaces arranged in predetermined positions, namely, predetermined positions of the photoconductive drums <b>58</b>Y, <b>58</b>M, <b>58</b>C and <b>58</b>B of the four image forming sections <b>50</b>Y, <b>50</b>M, <b>50</b>C and <b>50</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at a predetermined linear speed. In this specification, a direction where the laser beam is deflected by the light deflecting device <b>5</b> is called as a main scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The light deflecting device <b>5</b> has a polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>where a flat mirror with a plurality of surfaces (for example, eight surfaces) is arranged into a regular polygon shape, and a motor <b>5</b><i>b </i>which rotates the polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>at a predetermined speed. The polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>is formed of aluminum, for example. Respective reflecting surfaces of the polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>are realized in such a manner that the polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>is cut along the sub-scanning direction as a surface including the direction where the polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>rotates, namely, the surface perpendicular to the main scanning direction, and a surface protective layer such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited on a cut surface.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A post-deflection optical system <b>30</b> is provided between the light deflecting device <b>5</b> and the image surfaces. The post-deflection optical system <b>30</b> has first and second imaging lenses (so-called fθ lenses) <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>that give a predetermined optical property to the laser beam deflected to the predetermined direction by the reflecting surface of the light deflecting device <b>5</b>. The first and the second imaging lenses <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>are designed cooperatively with each other so that the image surfaces and the reflecting points on the polygon mirror surfaces establish a schematically conjugate relationship in sub-scanning direction. As a result, the first and the second imaging lenses <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>prevent a fluctuation in the sub-scanning position on the image surfaces due to an influence of tilt of the reflecting surfaces in the polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>(tilt between angles and axial lines of the center axis of the reflecting surface). For this reason, a positive power is provided in the sub-scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first and the second imaging lenses <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>are cooperative with each other so that the image surfaces and the reflecting points on the reflecting surfaces establish the schematically conjugate relationship in order to prevent the fluctuation in the sub-scanning direction on the image surfaces due to the influence of the tilt of the reflecting surfaces of the polygon mirror <b>5</b><i>a </i>(tilt between the angles and the axial lines of the reflecting surfaces). For this reason, the first and the second imaging lenses <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>have the positive power in the sub-scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the post-deflection optical system <b>30</b> has first reflecting mirrors <b>33</b>Y, <b>33</b>M, <b>33</b>C and <b>33</b>B, second reflecting mirrors <b>35</b>Y, <b>35</b>M and <b>35</b>C, and third reflecting mirrors <b>37</b>Y, <b>37</b>M and <b>37</b>C. The laser beam LB for black component emitted from the second imaging lens <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the post-deflection optical system <b>30</b> is reflected by the first reflecting mirror <b>33</b>B so as to be emitted to the photoconductor drum <b>58</b>B. Laser beams LY, LM and LC for the other color components emitted from the second imaging lens <b>30</b><i>b </i>are reflected by the first reflecting mirrors <b>33</b>Y, <b>33</b>M and <b>33</b>C, the second reflecting mirrors <b>35</b>Y, <b>35</b>M and <b>35</b>C, and the third reflecting mirrors <b>37</b>Y, <b>37</b>M and <b>37</b>C, sequentially so as to be emitted to the photoconductor drums <b>58</b>Y, <b>58</b>M and <b>58</b>C.</p>

Even when the light sources <b>3</b> (Y, M, C and B) emit a plurality of laser beams including the laser elements, the laser beams from the light sources are combined with an interval such that paired laser beams from the laser elements generally become one beam.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After predetermined convergence is given to the emanative laser beams L (Y, M, C and B) emitted from the light sources <b>3</b> (Y, M, C and B) by finite focal lenses <b>9</b> (Y, M, C and B), the sectional beam shapes are adjusted into the predetermined shapes by stops (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Predetermined convergence is further given to the laser beams L (Y, M, C and B) which pass through the stops only in the sub-scanning direction by glass cylinder lenses <b>11</b> (Y, M, C and B). The glass cylinder lenses <b>11</b> (Y, M, C and B) are composed of, for example, BK7. The laser beams L (Y, M, C and B), thereafter, are synthesized into approximately one optical path (one in the main scanning direction, but incident angles to the reflecting surface of the light deflecting device <b>5</b> or positions are slightly different in the sub-scanning direction) by optical path synthesizing units <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>and <b>13</b><i>d </i>such as reflecting mirrors or beam splitters.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The finite focal lenses <b>9</b> (Y, M, C and B) are composed of a single lens in which, for example, an UV curing plastic aspherical lens, not shown, is laminated with a spherical glass lens or an aspherical glass lens.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">This embodiment is characterized in that an environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> having the function for compensating displacement of the sub-scanning direction due to an environment change (for example, temperature change) is provided onto the common optical path (approximately combined one optical path) for the laser beams L (Y, M, C and B) before reaching the light deflecting device <b>5</b>. A free-form surface lens formed by plastic such as COP (cycloolefin polymer) or PMMA (polymethyl methacryl) is applied to the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b>. The environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> has a negative power at least in a sub-scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are conceptual explanatory diagrams of the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a diagram in the case where the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> is not provided, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a diagram in the case where the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> is provided.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, only the two of four laser beams for the color components (in this case, they are tentatively the laser beams LY and LB) are shown, and the first and the second imaging lenses (fθ lenses) <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>in the post-deflection optical system <b>30</b> are regarded as one lens having the function equivalent to the function in the case where two lenses are synthesized.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the temperature change is taken into consideration, a glass lens is more preferable than a plastic lens as the lenses applied to the device. The first and the second imaging lenses (fθ lenses) <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>, however, need to secure sufficient length in the main scanning direction, and thus the plastic lenses are adopted after their weight and cost are taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the case where the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> is not provided, the glass cylinder lenses <b>11</b>Y and <b>11</b>B are hardly influenced by the temperature change. For this reason, the laser beams LY and LB which pass through the glass cylinder lenses <b>11</b>Y and <b>11</b>B are hardly influenced by the temperature change, so as to advance the similar path. When temperature rises, however, the first and the second imaging lenses (fθ lenses) <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b>B composed of the plastic lenses are influenced by the state that as the dimension of the members become larger and the refractive index become smaller. As a result, the positive power is reduced, and when the laser beams reach the imaging surfaces (photoconductor drums <b>58</b>Y and <b>58</b>B), great displacement occurs in the sub-scanning direction. The paths shown by alternate long and short dash lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> represent this case.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the contrary, when the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> is provided, the laser beams LY and LB which pass through the glass cylinder lenses <b>11</b>Y and <b>11</b>B pass through the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> before they reach the first and the second imaging lenses (fθ lenses) <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>composed of the plastic lenses. When the plastic lenses having the negative power are adopted as the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b>, the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> functions so as to narrow the intervals between the laser beams on the reflecting surface <b>5</b>R of the light deflecting device <b>5</b> when the temperature rises. That is to say, the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> functions to an opposite direction to the direction where the first and the second imaging lenses (fθ lenses) <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>composed of the plastic lenses function when the temperature rises. As a result, it functions so as to narrow emitting positions of the imaging surfaces (photoconductor drums <b>58</b>Y and <b>58</b>B) of the laser beams LY and LB. When the power and the incident angle of the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> are set, an emitting position change amount can be set freely and can be set to be approximately equal before and after the rise of the temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to the equation (13), it is found that when the temperature rises by t, the emitting position of the laser beam LB may be moved from the position before the rise to an opposite direction only by the same amount as the absolute amount Δ expressed by the equation (13) (−Δ). The above explanation is given assuming that only the image by the laser beam LB changes, but both the emitting positions of the laser beams LB and LY change. The equation (13), therefore, expresses that when the temperature rises by t, the pitch between the laser beams LB and LY is changed only by −Δ. That is to say, the emitting positions of the photoconductor drums for the laser beams LB and LY are not fixed but the pitch between the emitting positions of the laser beams LB and LY is relatively moved only by −Δ which is opposite to the amount expressed by the equation (13). As a result, even if the ambient environment changes (particularly the temperature change), a plurality of images are not displaced (precise color registration is maintained).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For simplification of the explanation, the case of the two laser beams LB an LY is explained, but like the above embodiment, the similar function is applied to the case of the four laser beams LY, ML, LC and LB.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Only when the pitch between the beams in the sub-scanning direction expands only by αH×BP×t (here, BP is the gap between the beam positions in the sub-scanning direction on the image surfaces at the time of developing the optical path reflection from the deflecting surface to the image surfaces), the expansion of the optical system housing is just the same as the fluctuation in the gap of the laser beams from the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For this reason, the beam positions of the surfaces to be scanned (corresponding to the surfaces of the photoconductor drums) at the time of developing the reflecting mirrors are shifted only by Δ′ expressed by the equation (13′), occurrence of a shift of color overlapping due to temperature change can be prevented. As a result, an amount of the color shift without registration control can be suppressed, or the time interval of the registration control can be enlarged.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b>, as explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, suppresses the displacement in the sub-scanning direction on the surface to be scanned at the time of temperature change, but cannot completely suppress the shift of color overlapping by only setting the displacement of the beams to 0. For this reason, when the temperature rises by t, the characteristic and the shape of the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> are selected so that the beam positions on the surface to be scanned at the time of developing the reflecting mirrors shift only by −(αH−2×αF+αS)×(L×t)+αH×BP×t. As a result, the occurrence of the shift of color overlapping (error of color registration) due to temperature change can be prevented, and the amount of the color shift (error of color registration) without the registration control is suppressed or the time interval of the registration control can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In general, since the frame and the shaft are formed by iron materials, and the housing is formed of aluminum or plastic, αH&gt;αF≈αS is established. For this reason, −(αH−2αF+αS)×L&lt;0 is obtained. As a result, when the temperature rises, it is desirable that the increase in the interval in the sub-scanning direction is smaller than αH×BP×t as the optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The optimal optical power arrangement including the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> is carried out, so that the optical system, which suppress the fluctuation in the beam positions in the sub-scanning direction and reduces temperature dependency of the imaging surfaces in the sub-scanning direction, can be provided.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The optical beam scanning device and the image forming apparatus of the above-mentioned embodiment are explained according to the first concrete example.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the first concrete example, the material of the optical system housing is an aluminum die cast with linear expansion coefficient of αH=2.1×10<sup>−5</sup>, and the material of the frame for defining the intervals between the photoconductor drums is an aluminum die cast with linear expansion coefficient of αF=2.1×10<sup>−5</sup>. The material of the transfer belt driving shaft is free-cutting steel with linear expansion coefficient of αS=1.15×10<sup>−5</sup>, and the interval L between the photoconductor drums (for black and yellow) on both ends is 225 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the case where temperature rises by 15° C. (t=15), the ideal value Δ′ as a change amount of the distance between the beams on both ends in the sub-scanning direction can obtain 0.032 according to the equation (13′) (this means that when the emitting positions in the sub-scanning direction do not shift at all even if temperature changes, the shift of the color overlapping of 32 μm occurs).</p>

The distances between the adjacent surfaces of the optical elements are common among the laser beams LY (in the drawing, RAY <b>1</b>, and the same is applied to the other ones), LM (RAY<b>2</b>), LC (RAY<b>3</b>) and LB (RAY<b>4</b>) when the number is written in common row, and are different among the laser beams LY (RAY<b>1</b>), LM (RAY<b>2</b>), LC (RAY<b>3</b>), and LB (RAY<b>4</b>) when the number is written in ray<b>1</b>˜ray<b>4</b> row. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> describes data about the emitting surfaces and thereafter of the finite focal lenses <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>M, <b>9</b>C and <b>9</b>B, and the distances between the finite focal lenses <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>M, <b>9</b>C and <b>9</b>B and the imaging positions are 1159.4 mm, 1106.0 mm, 1136.0 mm and 1202.3 mm, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When the optical beam scanning device <b>1</b> of the concrete example is applied, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the laser beam LY (RAY<b>1</b>; yellow) and the laser beam LB (RAY<b>4</b>; black) move to a direction where they spread 25 μm wider than the housing expansion due to the temperature rise of 15° C. That is to say, the laser beams move to the direction where the registration shift amount of 32 μm when the emitting positions of the laser beams do not move is canceled. For this reason, even if the temperature rises by 15° C., the yellow and black overlapping shifts only by 7 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Similarly, the relationship between the laser beams LM (RAY<b>2</b>; magenta) and LB (RAY<b>4</b>; black) is such that L=75×2=150, and the registration shift amount when the light beams do not move is 22 μm. Since the relative distance between both the laser beams, however, moves 16 μm to the canceling direction, even if temperature rises by 15° C., the magenta and black overlapping shifts only by 6 μm. The relationship between the laser beams LC (RAY<b>3</b>; cyan) and LB (RAY<b>4</b>; black) is such that L=75, and the registration shift amount when the beams do not move is 11 μm. Since the relative distance of both the laser beams, however, moves by 14μ to the canceling direction, even if temperature rises by 15° C., the cyan and black overlapping shifts only by 3 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, a defocus change amount in the main scanning direction and the sub-scanning direction is suppressed to not more than 0.3.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(A-2) Second Concrete Example of the Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The second concrete example of the optical beam scanning device and the image forming apparatus according to the embodiment are explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the second concrete example, the material of the optical system housing is carbon fiber reinforced polycarbonate resin with linear expansion coefficient of αH=2.25×10<sup>−5</sup>, and the material of the frame which defines the intervals between the photoconductor drums is cold-rolled steel plate with linear expansion coefficient of αF=1.2×10<sup>−5</sup>. The material of the transfer belt driving shaft is stainless steel with linear expansion coefficient of αS=1.04×10<sup>−5</sup>, and the interval L between the photoconductor drums on both ends (for black and yellow) is 225 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the case where temperature rises by 15° C. (t=15), the ideal value Δ′ as a change amount of the distance between the beams on both ends in the sub-scanning direction can obtain −0.030 according to the equation (13′) (this means that when the emitting positions in the sub-scanning direction do not shift at all even if temperature changes, the shift of the color overlapping of 30 μm occurs).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the second concrete example, a member which defines heights of the light source (LD), the limited focal lenses and the glass cylinder lenses of the pre-deflection optical system is separated from the housing that holds all the entire optical parts. Concretely, this member is made of a metal matrix composite (ceramic reinforcement is used as a filler so as to be combined with metal matrix). The metal matrix composites with different thickness are sandwiched between the optical housing, the light sources (LD), the limited focal lenses and the glass cylinder lenses, so that the positions in the sub-scanning directions are made to be different.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The post-deflection optical system of the second concrete example is the same as the post-deflection optical system of the first concrete example.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref> are diagrams corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref> according to the first concrete example, and show only the pre-deflection optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the second concrete example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, when the temperature rises by 15° C., the laser beams LY (RAY<b>1</b>; yellow) and LB (RAY<b>4</b>; black) move to a direction where they become 5 μm smaller than the direction in the case of the housing expansion. That is to say, the beams LY and LB move to the direction where the registration shift amount of 30 μm in the case where the laser beam emitting positions do not move is canceled. For this reason, even when temperature rises by 15° C., the yellow and black overlapping shifts only by 25 μm (this value is large, but when the plastic lens with negative power is not provided to the pre-deflection optical system, as mentioned later, the shift is 114 μm, and thus 25 μm is very smaller than 114 μm).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the second concrete example, the defocus change amount in the main scanning direction and the sub-scanning direction is suppressed to not more than 0.3.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the second concrete example, when temperature rises, the intervals of the beams on the surfaces to be scanned can be small.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 20</figref> illustrate data about the optical systems in a comparative example. In the comparative example, the plastic lens is not provided as the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b>. The post-deflection optical system in the comparative example is similar to that in the second concrete example.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in the second concrete example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> in the second concrete example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a diagram corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> in the second concrete example.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the comparative example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the laser beams LY (RAY<b>1</b>; yellow) and the laser beam LB (RAY<b>4</b>; black) move to the direction where they spread 84 μm when temperature rises by 15° C.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the combination example of the materials of the housing, the frame member that defines the intervals between the photoconductor drums and the transfer belt driving shaft in the first concrete example, the registration shifts 84 μm with respect to the shift of 32 μm in the case where the laser beam emitting positions do not move. For this reason, when temperature rises by 15° C., the yellow and black overlapping shifts by 52 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the combination example of the materials of the housing, the frame member that defines the intervals between the photoconductor drums and the transfer belt driving shaft in the second concrete example, the registration shifts by 84 μm to the opposite direction in addition to the registration shift amount of 30 μm in the case where the beams do not move. For this reason, when temperature rises by 15° C., the yellow and black overlapping shifts by 114 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">It is clear that the provision of the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> (plastic lens) can suppress the color overlapping due to the temperature change.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, from the comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 12</figref> and the comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 17</figref>, the defocus change amount in the main scanning direction and the sub-scanning direction in the comparative example is larger than that in the first and the second concrete examples.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Even when the beam waist positions in the sub-scanning direction changes due to temperature change in the post-deflection optical system, the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> (plastic lens) is provided to the pre-deflection optical system, so that the imaging surfaces are shift to the opposite direction to the direction where the shift occurs in the post-deflection optical system and correction can be made. As a result, the shift of the color overlapping in the sub-scanning direction can be suppressed, and the color shift amount without the registration control can be suppressed, or the time intervals of the registration control can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Not only in the sub-scanning direction but also in the main scanning direction, the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> (plastic lens) is provided to the pre-deflection optical system, so that the similar effect can be produced in order to prevent defocus due to environment change.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">(B) Another Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The above embodiment explains the image forming apparatus where maximally four images are overlapped with one another, but the present invention can be applied to an image forming apparatus where the maximum number of images to be overlapped is smaller or larger than four. Further, the color components of the images to be overlapped are not limited to different color components.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The above embodiment explains that all the laser beams are guided onto the one surface of the polygon mirror, but the present invention can be suitably applied to an apparatus which uses the two surfaces of the polygon mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The above embodiment explains the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> which is the lens (plastic lens as one example) having the negative power, but another kind of optical element having similar incident and emission characteristics may be used. For example, transmitting or reflecting diffraction grating with non-uniform pitch can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Further, the above embodiment explains that the compensating function of the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> is determined according to the equation (13′), but the equation (13′) does not have to be considered for the compensating function. For example, when the temperature rise in the scanning optical unit is larger than the outside of the unit, as explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the compensating function may be determined so as to have temperature dependency opposite to that of the imaging lenses (first and second imaging lenses). That is to say, the compensating function does not have to be determined taking the linear expansion coefficient of the materials of the optical housing, the frame which defines the intervals between the photoconductor drums, and the transfer belt driving shaft into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The above embodiment explains the member which compensates the image shift according to the equation (13) is mainly composed of the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> provided to the position common among the plural laser beams in the pre-deflection optical system. The member, which compensates the image shift obtained by the equation (13) by means of movement of opposite positive or negative amount, may be provided on the optical paths of some of the plural laser beams. For example, the environment change compensating optical element <b>15</b> may be provided to positions obtained by synthesizing the two optical paths.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The above embodiment explains that the linear expansion coefficients of three materials of the optical housing, the frame which defines the intervals between the photoconductor drums and the transfer belt driving shaft are taken into consideration, but a number of the materials to be considered may be smaller or larger than three.</p>
