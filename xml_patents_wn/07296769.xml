<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to an insulation assembly for use with cryogenic fuel tanks and more specifically to an insulation assembly having improved bonding characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aerospace vehicle designs commonly utilize a variety of fuels to supply both launch and maneuvering power requirements. The quantity of fuel required for most missions, especially for launch requirements, often generates severe design constraints and can require considerable portions of vehicle size to be dedicated towards the carrying of fuel. The use of cryogenic fuels allows the fuels to be maintained in a liquid state rather than in their roomtemperature gaseous form. This allows a greater quantity of fuel to be stored in a smaller container. This, in turn, improves the design capabilities of aerospace vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current cryogenic fuel tank technology for expendable launch systems such as the external tank of the space shuttle use spray-on foam insulation. This technology, however, does not commonly satisfy the strength and reusability requirements associated with multi-mission flight environments. Expendable launch systems are often not considered appropriate for integration into reusable launch vehicle designs. Reusable launch vehicle (RLV) designs often require such vehicles to carry the cryogenic fuel tanks through launch, on-orbit, and reentry. The cryogenic insulation (“cryoinsulation”) is required to reduce launch pad cryogen boil-off and thermally protect fuel tanks during ground servicing, launch, on-orbit, and reentry. In addition, the cryoinsulation must be robust enough to withstand repeated thermal cycling.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cryoinsulation is applied to the exterior of the fuel tanks and can consist of a foam insulation layer and a thermal protection system (TPS) layer. It is desirable that the bond joint between the foam insulation layer and the thermal protection system be reliable to prevent peeling or other separation during the thermal cycling and other use related stresses of RLV applications. In addition, the cryoinsulation presents an opportunity for further protection of the fuel tank structure from damage due to on-orbit particle impact. Therefore, a cryogenic fuel tank system with an improved cryoinsulation design provides the opportunity to implement a variety of improvements to RLV design and application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be highly desirable to have a cryogenic fuel tank assembly with improved bonding characteristics within the cryoinsulation layers. It would further be highly desirable to develop a cryogenic fuel tank assembly with improved resilience to on-orbit particle impact.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object to the present invention to provide an cryogenic fuel tank assembly with improved bonding characteristics. It is further object to the present invention to provide a cryogenic fuel tank assembly with improved resistance to on-orbit particle impact.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the objects of the present invention a cryogenic fuel tank assembly is provided. The fuel tank assembly includes a cryogenic fuel tank wall. A foam assembly is affixed to the cryogenic fuel tank wall, the foam assembly having an inner surface and an outer surface. A first solid film bonded to the outer surface to provide a uniform outer bonding surface. A thermal protection system assembly is bonded to the uniform outer bonding surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent when viewed in light of the detailed description and preferred embodiment when taken in conjunction with the attached drawings and claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is an illustration of the fuel tank assembly <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention. The fuel tank assembly <b>10</b> is illustrated installed within an aerospace vehicle <b>12</b> such as a reusable launch vehicle (RLV). It should be understood that the fuel tank assembly <b>10</b> can be utilized in a wide variety of aerospace vehicles <b>12</b> and the vehicle shown is for illustrative purposes only. Similarly, the fuel tank assembly <b>10</b> is illustrated as comprising a forward fuel tank <b>14</b> and a rear fuel tank <b>16</b>. It should be understood, however that the number and orientation of fuel tanks <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> within the RLV <b>12</b> are contemplated to be application specific.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fuel tank assembly <b>10</b> is intended to contain a cryogenic fuel supply <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The cryogenic fuel supply <b>18</b> must be thermally protected such that the fuel is kept within a temperature range suitable to prevent boil-off or phase change. The present invention provides a unique approach to maintaining such a temperature range through the use of an insulation system <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> applied to the cryogenic fuel tank wall <b>22</b>. The insulation system <b>20</b> includes a foam assembly <b>24</b> applied and secured to the cryogenic fuel tank wall <b>22</b>. A wide variety of foam assemblies <b>24</b> are contemplated by the present invention. One embodiment contemplates a multi-layer foam assembly with individual layers such as a polyimide foam layer <b>26</b> and a polyurethane foam layer <b>28</b>. The foam assembly has an inner surface <b>30</b> nearest the fuel tank wall <b>22</b> and an outer surface <b>32</b> farthest from the fuel tank wall <b>22</b>. Although the foam layers <b>26</b>,<b>28</b> may be arranged in a variety of fashions, one embodiment contemplates placing the polyurethane foam layer <b>28</b> inboard <b>34</b> of the polyimide foam layer <b>26</b>. It should be understood that a wide variety of foam assemblies <b>24</b> are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foam assembly <b>24</b> can further include a honeycomb core <b>36</b> positioned within the foam. A wide variety of honeycomb core <b>36</b> materials may be utilized. One embodiment contemplates the use of a 2.0-pcf-density and a ⅜-inch hexagonal cell size. The honeycomb core <b>36</b> provides a solid structural base for the foam assembly <b>24</b> and may be utilized to broaden the range of foam materials that can be utilized by the present invention by removing or reducing strength requirements from the foam material. The foam assembly <b>24</b> is positioned between the fuel tank wall <b>22</b> and a thermal protection system <b>38</b>. The foam assembly <b>24</b> is affixed to both the fuel tank wall <b>22</b> and the thermal protection system <b>38</b> such that a coherent insulation system <b>20</b> is generated. Thermal protection systems <b>38</b> are well known in the art and are known to come in a variety of configurations and materials. TPS such as the ceramic tiles utilized on the space shuttle are only one example. The nature of most thermal protection systems, however, is that they are commonly comprised of semi-rigid elements.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The rigid nature of the fuel tank wall <b>22</b> and thermal protection system <b>38</b> also generates fairly smooth mating surfaces for which to affix the foam assembly <b>24</b>. The inner and outer surfaces <b>30</b>,<b>32</b> of the foam assembly <b>24</b> (with or without the honeycomb core <b>36</b>) often represent varying surfaces that can make bonding to the fuel tank wall <b>22</b> and the thermal protection system <b>38</b> difficult. This can in turn negatively impact the bond joint between the foam assembly <b>24</b> and the thermal protection system <b>38</b>. The present invention improves on this situation by including a first solid film <b>40</b> bonded to the outer surface <b>32</b> of the foam assembly <b>24</b>. The first solid film <b>40</b> is utilized to generate a uniform outer surface <b>42</b> that allows for improved bonding with the thermal protection system <b>38</b>. An adhesive material <b>44</b> may therefore be used to bond the thermal protection system <b>38</b> to the uniform outer surface <b>42</b> with resultant improved bond strength due to the uniform outer bonding surface <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention can further include a first fabric layer <b>46</b> which can be utilized alone or in combination with the first solid film <b>40</b>. The first fabric layer <b>46</b> provides not only the uniform outer surface <b>42</b> suitable for bonding, but additionally provides an increased protection of the cryogenic fuel supply <b>18</b> from particle impact experienced in on-orbit. Resistance to orbital debris and micrometeoroid impact can be important to vehicle re-entry and landing. The use of the first fabric layer <b>46</b>, such as a 1-mil thick glass fabric in one embodiment, provides additional protection by generating an additional barrier for particles that may have penetrated the thermal protection system <b>38</b>. Although a single fabric material <b>46</b> has been described, it should be understood that a wide variety of fabric laminate materials may be utilized. The amount of impact protection balanced with the added weight and resultant bond strength can be utilized to evaluate potential fabric materials <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A second fabric layer <b>48</b> may be additionally utilized to further improve impact protection. The second fabric layer <b>48</b> is bonded to the inner surface <b>30</b> of the foam assembly <b>20</b>. The second fabric layer <b>48</b> not only generates a uniform inner bonding surface <b>50</b>, but when used in combination with the first fabric layer <b>48</b> further increases the impact protection of the cryogenic fuel supply <b>18</b>. The second fabric layer <b>48</b> may also be utilized to improve the bond strength between the foam assembly <b>20</b> and the fuel tank wall <b>22</b>. The uniform inner bonding surface <b>50</b> can be bonded to the fuel tank wall <b>22</b> in a variety of fashions. One embodiment contemplates the use of a polyurethane adhesive <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although the present invention can be assembled in a variety of fashions, it is contemplated that in one embodiment the foam assembly <b>24</b>, the honeycomb core <b>36</b> and the solid film <b>40</b>/fabric <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> layers may be assembled prior to bonding to the fuel tank wall <b>22</b> and thermal protection system <b>38</b>. In this embodiment, the uneured Loam assembly <b>24</b> is used to fill the honeycomb core <b>36</b>. The solid film <b>40</b> and/or fabric combinations <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are ten also applied in an uncured state. The film <b>40</b> and fabric <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> can then be cured to the honeycomb core <b>36</b> simultaneously with the curing of the foam assembly <b>24</b>. This allows the additional strength and bonding characteristics provided by the film/fabric <b>40</b>,<b>46</b>,<b>48</b> to be imparted to the foam assembly <b>24</b> without adding time or undue manufacturing process.</p>
