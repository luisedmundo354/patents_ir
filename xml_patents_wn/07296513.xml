<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/541,421, field on Feb. 3, 2004 and incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a tool for use in arts and crafts. More particularly, the present invention relates to a tool for use in creating a textured surface on a sheet of material.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the arts and crafts field, it is often necessary and/or desirable to add a specific texture to a piece of material, be it cardstock, paper, vellum or other materials. One conventional system for adding a texture to a material involves placing a “texture plate” under the sheet of material to be manipulated, after which the user uses a stylus or similar hard object to press the material against the texture plate. This action causes the material to obtain a texture substantially identical to the texture that exists on the texture plate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although moderately useful, the above prior art method and others for adding a texture to a sheet of material have several significant drawbacks. First, using a stylus or similar implement can be difficult to control, resulting in the user inadvertently adding texture to portions of the material that he or she did not intend. Second, if the user presses too hard with the stylus against the sheet of material, the material could be torn, scratched or otherwise defaced in an undesirable manner. Additionally, a stylus or similar implement often results in an uneven texture being applied to the material, due to different pressures being applied in different locations. Furthermore, if the texture-inducing implement does not fall squarely into an individual crevice or dimple, the embossed texture will not be of an extremely high quality, resulting in an inferior overall appearance to the embossment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved texture-creating device that provides for a uniform and consistent embossment of the texture on a sheet of material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved texture-creating device that is simple to use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an improved texture-creating tool that reduces the risk of inadvertently tearing or damaging the material to be manipulated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved texture-creating tool that gives the user an increased level of accuracy in the portions of the material that are to be manipulated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the above objects, a texture tool according to the present invention comprises a body coupled to an upper cap and a lower cap. A ball holder rests in a socket defined by the inside of the body and the lower cap. The ball holder includes a plurality of balls that are mounted within depressions on the ball holder along a flat surface. When a user desires to add a texture to a material, the user simply moves the texture tool along the material such that the plurality of the balls rub against the material in the desired location, creating a consistent and uniform texture in the desired area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further advantages and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following specification and drawings illustrating the preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A texture tool constructed according to the principals of the present invention is shown generally at <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. The texture tool <b>20</b> comprises a body <b>22</b> to which is coupled an upper cap <b>24</b> and a lower cap <b>26</b>. The lower portion <b>23</b> of the body <b>22</b> and the lower cap <b>26</b> combine to form a socket <b>30</b> on the inside thereof, as is shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A ball holder <b>28</b> partially fits within the socket <b>30</b>. The ball holder <b>28</b> includes a plurality of balls <b>34</b> that are mounted within a plurality of depressions <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) on a flat surface <b>38</b> of the ball holder <b>28</b>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, there are three balls <b>34</b> that are securely mounted within the depressions <b>36</b> of the ball holder <b>28</b>, for reasons more specifically explained herein. In one embodiment of the invention, the body <b>22</b> also includes a plurality of grip portions <b>40</b> by which a user can securely hold onto the texture tool <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The ball holder <b>28</b> is free to rotate within the socket <b>30</b>, essentially creating a ball-and-socket joint and allowing the individual balls <b>34</b> to catch edges and/or texture plate depressions <b>44</b> and remain in the texture plate depressions <b>44</b>, improving the quality of the overall embossment. The ball holder <b>26</b> is substantially spherical except for the flat surface <b>38</b>. The ball holder <b>28</b> has enough clearance to permit it to rotate, allowing a neutral hand position and allowing the individual balls <b>34</b> to fall into the texture plate depressions <b>44</b> and spin with the ball holder <b>28</b> about a substantially vertical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a plurality of independent spring-loaded pins <b>46</b> could be located within the texture tool <b>20</b> and press against a flat, rotating surface <b>48</b> to accomplish the same effect. It is also possible to use other arrangements, such as a flat washer <b>50</b> with a dimple <b>52</b> in the center for accepting a stylus ball <b>54</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, to create a spinning and rotating flat surface. All of these arrangements and others have the effect of creating a plane that is free to float and spin in order to remain in contact with another surface even when the orientation of the rest of the tool is altered.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the texture tool <b>20</b> is used to create a texture on a sheet of material <b>32</b> that is placed on top of a texture plate <b>42</b>. To create the texture, the user simply positions the texture tool <b>20</b> with the flat surface <b>38</b> towards the material <b>32</b>, causing the balls <b>34</b> to come into contact with the material <b>30</b>. The user then moves the texture tool <b>20</b> back and forth in the desired locations on the material <b>32</b>, causing the balls <b>34</b> and the texture plate <b>42</b> to create an impression, or imprint, on the material <b>32</b>. This is accomplished as the plurality of balls <b>34</b> press against, and partially into, individual texture plate depressions <b>44</b>, which in turn causes the material <b>32</b> to be embossed or imprinted.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As discussed earlier, a preferred embodiment of the invention, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes three balls <b>34</b> positioned within the ball holder <b>28</b>. This is important because three points define a plane. Four or more points, however, can define multiple planes. Therefore, if there are four or more balls <b>34</b> on the flat surface <b>38</b>, there would not be sufficient support for one or more of the balls <b>34</b>. This would prevent the contact points of all of the individual balls <b>34</b> from falling partially into the texture plate depressions <b>44</b>. For those ball contact points that do not fall into the texture plate depressions <b>44</b>, there will be an inferior embossed texture. If there are less than three ball contact points, however, the user will have significantly less control over the entire texture tool <b>20</b>, since two points do not define a plane at all. This can lead to the user inadvertently dragging a portion of the texture tool <b>20</b> across the material <b>32</b> that was not intended to be embossed or imprinted.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the balls <b>34</b> are polished steel embossing balls having a diameter of about 0.125 inches. The body <b>22</b>, the upper cap <b>24</b>, the lower cap <b>26</b>, the ball holder <b>28</b> and the grip portions <b>40</b> can all be made of various plastic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be clear to those skilled in the art, that potential modifications can be made to the embodiments described above. For example, each of the individual components of the texture tool <b>20</b> could be formed from a variety of acceptable materials. It will therefore be well understood by those in the art that modifications can be made to the above embodiments without departing from the invention in its broader aspects.</p>
