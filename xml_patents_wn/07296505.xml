<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The technical scope of the invention is that of muzzle brakes for weapons.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Muzzle brakes are well known to somebody skilled in the art. After firing, they enable part of the propellant gases of a piece of ammunition to be directed towards gas reception vanes integral with the gun barrel. The gases thereby exert a force on the vanes that oppose the recoil stress.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent FR2718839 describes such a known muzzle brake.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally speaking, a muzzle brake is sought to be designed that is as efficient as possible in its braking capacity but whose mass is as small as possible so as to reduce the mechanical torques on the gun trunnions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These two requirements are, a priori, contradictory since a simple means of improving efficiency is to increases the reception surfaces for the gases thereby leading to an increase in the dimension and thus the mass of the muzzle brake.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The aim of the invention is to propose an extremely efficient muzzle brake with a mass that is as low as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further aim of the invention is to propose means enabling a muzzle brake to be simply and reliably joined to a gun barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the invention relates to a muzzle brake for a gun comprising at least one substantially cylindrical body intended to be positioned in the extension of a gun barrel, such body incorporating at least two stages of gas reception vanes, such body perforated by vents directing the propellant gases towards the vanes, brake wherein it incorporates at least one means to deflect the gas flow, such means positioned between the vents of the second stage of vanes and a front profile of the vanes of the first stage.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one characteristic of the invention, the deflector means are constituted by a flange extending angularly over all the width of the front profile of the vanes of the first stage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The vanes of the second stage may be advantageously shaped as relatively thin dividers having at least one reinforcing rib oriented substantially radially with respect to the brake axis.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each vane of the second stage may also be connected to a vane of the first stage by relatively thin dividers delimiting a chamber that communicates with the exterior by an opening having a substantially rectangular section, such dividers having at least one second reinforcing rib oriented substantially in parallel to the muzzle axis.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The dividers may have a second reinforcing rib positioned in the vicinity of the mouth of the opening delimited by the dividers, such rib extending longitudinally on either side of the first radial rib and up to the vane of the first stage.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The dividers delimiting each chamber of the second stage may incorporate substantially plane portions parallel to the brake axis and which extend up to the body by plane, substantially radial portions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The width of the chamber openings in the second stage may be between 100% and 200% of the gun calibre.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The radial portions delimiting each chamber may form an angle between 100° and 150°.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The brake will preferably be made of cast steel or cast titanium, materials having in any case a limit of elasticity greater than or equal to 1000 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another characteristic of the invention, the brake vents may be radial perforations having the profile of extensions slots extending longitudinally over the full length of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The muzzle brake will advantageously incorporate two or three vents in each chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another characteristic of the invention, the brake may incorporate an internal bore having two different diameters separated by a counter-sink forming an axial limit stop for the gun barrel, a first diameter being equal to the external diameter of a front end of the gun barrel and a second diameter being equal to the calibre of the gun barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another characteristic of the invention, the muzzle brake may incorporate an opening intended to receive a cleat to ensure its joining with the gun barrel, such cleat being fastened by flanges to the brake body and incorporating two concurrent plane surfaces intended to cooperate with matching surfaces on the gun barrel so as to prevent the relative rotation of the brake/barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cleat may advantageously incorporate means to fasten a barrel reflector.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a muzzle brake <b>1</b> according to the invention is shown fastened to the front end of a gun barrel <b>2</b>. The brake is linked in rotation with the barrel <b>2</b> by means of a cleat <b>3</b> that is made integral with the brake by four screws <b>4</b>. This cleat <b>3</b> will be described in greater detail hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The muzzle brake <b>1</b> comprises a substantially cylindrical body <b>5</b> fastened in the extension of the barrel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The body <b>5</b> has two stages <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>of gas reception vanes (refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Each stage thus incorporates two vanes placed symmetrically with respect to a vertical plane (which is also the plane of section BB traced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Thus, after firing the gases are evacuated following a substantially horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Classically, the body <b>5</b> is perforated with vents <b>7</b> enabling the propellant gases to be directed towards vanes <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>. The vents directing the gases towards the first stage of vanes <b>6</b><i>a </i>are designated as <b>7</b><i>a </i>in the Figures. Those which direct the gases to the second stage of vanes <b>6</b><i>b </i>are designated <b>7</b><i>b </i>in the Figures.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Vents <b>7</b>, here, are radial perforations and are thus perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>8</b> of the brake <b>1</b>. They have the profile of elongated slots extending longitudinally for a length that enables their impact on the ammunition to be limited.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with one characteristic of the invention, the vanes <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the second stage are formed into relatively thin dividers (of a thickness less than 10 mm) provided with reinforcing ribs <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, each vane <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the second stage is connected to a vane <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first stage by relatively thin dividers <b>10</b> (of a thickness less than 10 mm) which delimit a chamber <b>11</b> communicating with the exterior by an opening <b>12</b> with a substantially rectangular section (refer in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">These dividers <b>10</b> extend beyond the vanes <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first stage by panels <b>10</b><i>a </i>connected to the body <b>5</b> and thus delimiting two other chambers surrounding the vents <b>7</b><i>a </i>in the first stage.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As is more particularly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the dividers <b>10</b> have a first reinforcing rib <b>9</b><i>a </i>oriented substantially radially with respect to the brake axis <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, the dividers <b>10</b> also incorporate a second reinforcing rib <b>9</b><i>b </i>positioned in the vicinity of the mouth of the opening <b>12</b> delimited by the dividers <b>10</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) and which three-quarter surrounds this opening.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">This rib <b>9</b><i>b </i>extends longitudinally on either side of the radial rib <b>9</b><i>a </i>and up to the vane <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first stage. Each longitudinal rib <b>9</b><i>a </i>is thus oriented substantially in parallel to the brake axis <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This design of the brake stages in the form of thin ribbed dividers enables the muzzle brake to be made considerably lighter whilst retaining its mechanical strength.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The material implemented to make the brake will be a cast steel having high mechanical strength (limit of elasticity (Rp0.2) greater or equal to 1000 MPa. The brake may also be made of cast titanium that has a similar limit of elasticity.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first reinforcing rib <b>9</b><i>a </i>(or front rib) limits the deformation of the vent <b>6</b><i>b </i>under the effect of the gas pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The second reinforcing rib <b>9</b><i>b </i>(or peripheral rib) reinforces the dividers <b>10</b> delimiting the chambers <b>11</b> preventing them from opening under the effect of the gas pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, and as may be more particularly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the dividers <b>10</b> delimiting the chambers <b>11</b> of the second stage incorporate portions <b>10</b><i>c </i>that are substantially plane and parallel to the axis <b>8</b> of the brake <b>1</b> (and to the horizontal plane AA). These plane portions <b>10</b><i>c </i>partially delimit the rectangular opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The plane portions <b>10</b><i>c </i>extend up to the body <b>5</b> of the brake <b>1</b> by plane portions <b>10</b><i>d </i>that are oriented substantially radially with respect to the body <b>5</b> of the brake <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The plane portions <b>10</b><i>d </i>define plane radial planes <b>15</b> (or opening planes for the chambers <b>11</b> of the brake <b>1</b>) which together form an angle □ of around 120° (this angle may be of 100° to 150°).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Three vents <b>7</b><i>b </i>are positioned in each chamber <b>11</b>. The vents are evenly spaced angularly in an opening sector of 120°.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The width L of the chamber <b>12</b> openings in the second stage is thus between 100% and 200% of the calibre of the weapon.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Such an arrangement, for a given calibre, facilitates maximal withdrawal of gas and thus maximal braking efficiency. The gases are then evacuated after being channeled by the plane portions <b>10</b><i>c</i>. The gases are thus ejected in a horizontal direction parallel to plane AA.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to an important characteristic of the invention, the brake incorporates at least one means <b>13</b> to deflect the gas flow, such means being positioned between the vents <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the second stage of vanes and the front profile <b>14</b> of the vanes of the first stage (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The deflector means are constituted by a flange <b>13</b> extending angularly over the full length of the front profile <b>14</b> of the vanes <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the first stage, thus over the full angular sector α delimited by the radial planes <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The flange <b>13</b> is succeeded by a groove <b>26</b>. This results in the aerodynamic flow being deviated upon exiting the vents <b>7</b><i>b</i>. This further results in a depression in the groove <b>26</b> and along the front profile <b>14</b>. The pressure exerted along the front profile <b>14</b> is thereby limited, pressure which would otherwise exert an effect opposing the braking. The global performance of the brake is thus improved. Moreover, the deflector <b>13</b> enables the gas ejection rate to be increased further improving the performance of the muzzle brake.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With respect to a classical brake incorporating two stages of vanes, the brake according to the invention has a mass reduced by 10 to 20% (this thanks to the partitioned structure). Moreover, its performance is improved by 5 to 10% thanks to the deflector and to the chamber profile.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> reveals that the brake body <b>5</b> incorporates an inner bore which is in two parts <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>each with a different diameter and separated by a counter-sink <b>17</b> forming an axial limit stop for the gun barrel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The rear part <b>16</b><i>a </i>has a diameter equal to the external diameter of the front end of the gun barrel <b>2</b>. The front part <b>16</b><i>b </i>has a diameter equal to the calibre of the gun barrel. Thus, the counter-sink <b>17</b> is equal to the thickness of the gun barrel <b>2</b>. Thus, after firing, a projectile is guided inside the muzzle brake as it is inside the gun barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The rear part <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the bore has artillery threading <b>18</b> intended to allow the brake <b>1</b> to be screwed onto the gun barrel <b>2</b> which has matching threading.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The gun barrel <b>2</b> naturally incorporates a smooth forward seat (not shown) extending its threaded part, such seat fitting into the rear part <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the bore. This forward seat incorporates oblong drill holes (not shown) positioned angularly such that they lie opposite the vents <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the first stage of the muzzle brake.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Such a structure of the perforated gun barrel whose drill holes cooperate with the vents of a muzzle brake is well known, namely by patent FR2718839. It is thus unnecessary to describe this structure of the barrel <b>2</b> in any further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In accordance with another characteristic of the invention, the muzzle brake <b>1</b> incorporates an opening <b>19</b> intended to receive the cleat <b>3</b> ensuring it is joined with the gun barrel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">This opening is globally rectangular in shape. It is housed between the upper panels <b>10</b><i>a </i>delimiting the chambers surrounding the vents <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the first stage. Two extra thicknesses <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the brake body <b>5</b> are positioned on either side of the opening <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). They are intended to act as bearing surfaces for flanges <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>integral with the cleat <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">These extra thicknesses are threaded <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) so as to receive screws <b>4</b> to attach the cleat <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As may be more particularly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the cleat <b>4</b> incorporates two longitudinal tongues <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b</i>, between the flanges <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, each incorporating a plane end surface <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>which is intended to come into contact with a matching plane surface on the gun barrel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The end surfaces <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>are concurrent. Thus, when they are applied against the barrel <b>2</b> they prevent any relative rotation of the brake <b>1</b> with respect to the barrel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The brake is thus very simply joined to the gun barrel. Indeed, its axial immobilization is obtained by the abutment of the end of the barrel <b>2</b> against the counter-sink <b>17</b>. Its immobilization in rotation is then ensured by simply fastening the cleat <b>3</b> in the opening <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Advantageously, the cleat <b>3</b> will incorporate a prismatic extension <b>25</b> on its upper part which will enable a barrel reflector to be affixed. This may be done simply by means of the threading <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Such an arrangement simplifies the fastening of such mirrors. Indeed, in a known manner these mirrors are reference means enabling the fire control to know the actual geometric position of the end of a gun barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For firing to be accurate, it is thus essential for the mirror to be exactly positioned with respect to the barrel. Here, thanks to the invention, the position of the extension <b>25</b> with respect to the barrel is precisely controlled since this extension is integral with the tongues <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>which press directly on the barrel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thus, the cleat <b>3</b> proposed by the invention enables the muzzle brake to be joined whilst providing a spatial reference of the end of the gun barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Such a cleat may naturally be implemented with another type of muzzle brake.</p>
