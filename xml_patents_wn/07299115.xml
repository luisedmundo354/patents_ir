<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-002907 filed on Jan. 8, 2004 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electrically-driven vehicle having a push-walk function.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electrically-drive-assisted bicycle is disclosed in JP-A-2003-95182 which uses a resultant force of manpower and an assist power as a driving force. The electrically-drive-assisted bicycle is provided with a push-walk function which allows the bicycle to travel at a speed which is slower than a usual vehicle speed and is substantially equal to a speed that a man walks. The application of the push-walk function to an electrically-driven vehicle such as a scooter is hereinafter discussed. Here, the electrically-drive-assisted bicycle adopts the structure in which a one-way clutch or the like is interposed between a pedal crank and a drive shaft or between a motor and the drive shaft. Thus, even when the push-walk function is driven during usual traveling, the adjustment is configured to be performed between the speed of the pedal traveling using manpower and the speed of the push-walk function.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since the electrically-operated scooter or the like uses the power of the electrically-operated motor as the main driving force, when the push-walk function is driven during usual traveling, the driving force of the electrically-operated motor is changed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problem. It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrically-driven vehicle which allows the push walk only when a given condition is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to an electrically-driven vehicle which includes an electrically-driven motor for driving a drive wheel. A battery is provided for supplying electric power to the electrically-driven motor. A throttle is provided for adjusting the vehicle speed. A control part is provided for controlling the electrically-driven motor based on an output of the throttle. The electrically-driven vehicle includes push-walk switch means for allowing a rider to instruct push-walk traveling and vehicle state detection means for detecting a state of a vehicle. The control part controls the electrically-driven motor in the push-walk traveling only when the control part receives an instruction from the push-walk switch means and when the vehicle state which is detected by the vehicle state detection means satisfies a preset condition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The control part is configured to receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means and to control the electrically-operated motor in the push walk traveling when the vehicle state satisfies the preset condition at the time of receiving the instruction. Accordingly, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by a rider when the vehicle state does not satisfy the preset condition, the control part maintains the usual traveling as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides the control part that does not perform a control based on the output of the throttle during the exercise of the push-walk traveling.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since the control part is configured not to perform the control based on the output of the throttle during the exercise of the push-walk traveling, the control of the push-walk traveling can be continuously performed even when the rider opens the throttle during the push-walk traveling.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides that the preset condition is a condition wherein an opening of the throttle is not larger than a fixed value.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Since the control part is configured not to perform the push-walk traveling unless the opening of the throttle is not larger than the fixed value, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider in a state that the rider performs the traveling by opening the throttle, the control part can maintain the usual traveling as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides that the preset condition is a condition wherein the vehicle speed is not larger than a fixed value.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Since the control part is configured not to perform the push-walk traveling unless the vehicle speed is not larger than a fixed value, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider in a state when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value, the control part can maintain the usual traveling as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention provides the control part that does not receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The control part is configured not to receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value. Accordingly, when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value, that is, in case that the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value, even when the push-walk switch is manipulated by the rider during the usual traveling, the control part is capable of preventing the occurrence of the lowering of the speed of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The electrically-driven vehicle is configured to allow the push walk when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider during a period in which the vehicle state assumes the preset state. Accordingly, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated during the period in which the vehicle state does not assume the preset state, for example, during the usual traveling, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect wherein the usual traveling can be continued as it is without shifting the state to the push-walk state.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment not to perform the control based on the throttle manipulation in the state that the push-walk traveling is performed. Accordingly, when the electrically-driven vehicle is in the push-walk traveling state, even when the throttle manipulation is performed by the rider or the like, it is possible to have an advantageous effect wherein the push-walk manipulation can be maintained as it is without shifting the traveling control to the traveling control based on the throttle manipulation (usual traveling control).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment to perform the control of push-walk traveling in response to the manipulation of the push-walk switch means which is performed by the rider when the opening of the throttle is in the state of being not more than a given value. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect that the electrically-driven vehicle can be controlled not to perform the push-walk control even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider when the opening of the throttle is not less than the given value.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment to perform the control of push-walk traveling when the manipulation of push-walk switch means is performed by the rider in the state wherein the vehicle speed is not more than the given value. Accordingly, even when the manipulation of the push-walk switch means is performed by the rider when the vehicle speed is not smaller than the given value, for example, in the usual traveling state, it is possible to have an advantageous effect that the usual traveling state can be maintained as it is without shifting the traveling state of the electrically-driven vehicle to the push-walk traveling state.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment not to receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means when the vehicle speed exceeds the given value. Accordingly, even when the manipulation of the push-walk switch means is performed by the rider when the vehicle speed exceeds the given value, for example, during the usual traveling, the lowering of the speed of the vehicle is not generated. Thus, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect that a more favorable traveling feeling can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The constitution of the power unit <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is explained in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The wheel portion <b>161</b> is a member which has a center side (that is, a drum portion <b>167</b> side) thereof projecting to a side opposite to the motor <b>100</b> from the center in the vehicle widthwise direction of the rear wheel <b>23</b>. That is, a boss portion <b>166</b> which becomes the rotary center portion in the rear wheel <b>23</b> is in an offset state.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, in the inside of the wheel portion <b>161</b> which is offset in the above-mentioned manner, the speed reduction mechanism <b>158</b> is arranged in an embedded manner between the motor <b>100</b> and the rear wheel <b>23</b>. Accordingly, even when the reduction-type power unit <b>22</b> is adopted, the amount of projection of the power unit <b>22</b> in the vehicle-sideward direction with respect to the rear wheel <b>23</b> can be decreased. Accordingly, it is possible to arrange the power unit <b>22</b> which is a heavy object and the rear wheel <b>23</b> at an approximately center in the vehicle width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, the power transmission from the motor <b>100</b> to the rear wheel <b>23</b> is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A drive current is supplied to the stator <b>131</b> in response to the control from the driver <b>103</b>. The control of the drive current is performed using a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The PWM control is a method for controlling the rotational speed (and torque) of the motor <b>100</b> by applying a pulse-like voltage to the motor <b>100</b> and by changing a ratio of intervals of ON/OFF of the pulse (a duty ratio).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Due to the above-mentioned PWM control, the rotor <b>134</b> is rotated due to a rotary magnetic field which is generated around the stator <b>131</b> and the output shaft <b>101</b> is rotated correspondingly. The power from the output shaft <b>101</b> is subjected to a speed reduction by way of the toothed portion <b>137</b> and the toothed portion <b>155</b> and is transmitted to the axle <b>102</b>. In this manner, power from the motor <b>100</b> is subjected to a speed reduction and is transmitted to the rear wheel <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this embodiment, a speed reduction mechanism which uses the output shaft <b>101</b> and the axle <b>102</b> and has a fixed reduction ratio is illustrated. However, it may be possible that the power from the motor <b>100</b> is subjected to a changeover of speed by another transmission and is transmitted to the rear wheel <b>23</b>. For such a speed reduction mechanism, a variable-speed transmission may be used, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the electrically-driven vehicle according to this embodiment also includes a regenerative charging mechanism. That is, the electrically-driven vehicle <b>10</b> has a function that when the electrically-driven vehicle <b>10</b> is subjected to a reduction in speed by operating the drum brake device, the front brake or the like, the motor <b>100</b> is driven as a power generator and a rotational force which is transmitted from the rear wheel <b>23</b> to the motor <b>100</b> at the time of performing a reduction in speed is converted into electric energy and the electric energy is stored in the batteries <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>

An AC input port <b>25</b><i>m </i>is a port for connection with an external AC power source at the time of charging.

The memory <b>25</b><i>n </i>is connected with the speed meter <b>400</b> via the communication port <b>25</b><i>o </i>and the content of the memory <b>25</b><i>n </i>is transmitted to the speed meter <b>400</b>, and the speed meter <b>400</b> which receives this information displays the corresponding information on the respective display parts explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The battery residual quantity information is displayed on the battery residual quantity display part <b>400</b><i>a </i>and the battery residual quantity alarm display <b>400</b><i>g </i>is turned on in a given case. The total traveled distance information and the trip traveled distance information are displayed on the distance display part <b>400</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Hereinafter, an explanation is made with respect to the connection between devices other than the battery control unit <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. A throttle sensor <b>77</b><i>a </i>for detecting the opening of the throttle which is mounted on the grip <b>77</b> and a push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>for starting up the control of the push walk which is mounted on the handle bar <b>35</b> are connected with a throttle/push-walk input port <b>103</b><i>d </i>of the driver <b>103</b> via a coupler <b>404</b><i>b</i>. The seat switch <b>27</b><i>a </i>for detecting a sitting/non-sitting position of a rider and is mounted on the seat <b>27</b> and is connected with a seat switch input port <b>103</b><i>e </i>of the driver <b>103</b> via a coupler <b>404</b><i>c</i>. A rotor angle input port <b>103</b><i>f </i>of the driver <b>103</b> is connected with a rotor angle sensor of the motor <b>100</b> via the coupler <b>404</b><i>d</i>, wherein the rotor angle information of the motor <b>100</b> is transmitted to the driver <b>103</b> and the driver <b>103</b> obtains a vehicle-speed pulse based on a value of the rotor angle information. A positive pole of the driver <b>103</b> is connected to a positive pole of the left-side battery in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and one terminal of a smoothing capacitor <b>104</b> via a fuse <b>414</b>, a jack <b>410</b> and a plug <b>408</b>. A negative pole of the driver <b>103</b> is connected to a negative pole of the right-side battery <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and another terminal of the smoothing capacitor <b>104</b> via a fuse <b>412</b>, a jack <b>411</b> and a plug <b>409</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, an explanation is made with respect to functions of the battery control unit <b>25</b>. The battery control unit <b>25</b> has a function of performing a charge control of the battery based on the information obtained via a voltage detection port <b>25</b><i>c </i>and a temperature detection port <b>25</b><i>e</i>. Further, the battery control unit <b>25</b> has a function of calculating the battery residual quantity based on a voltage value of the batteries <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> and a current value obtained via a current detection port <b>25</b><i>f</i>. The battery control unit <b>25</b> is started up in response to the power source connection of an AC input port <b>25</b><i>m</i>, the turning-on of the main switch <b>42</b> and the overvoltage of the battery and processing consisting of the charge control, the start-up of the driver and the starting of the driver in an overvoltage prevention mode are respectively performed. Further, when necessary, the battery control unit <b>25</b> also has a function of instructing a refreshing discharge to the driver <b>103</b> so as to allow the batteries <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> to discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the operation up to the start-up of the motor is explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. First of all, when the main switch <b>42</b> is pushed, the battery control unit <b>25</b> is started up via the start-up port <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the battery control unit <b>25</b>, and the voltage, the charge state, the temperature state and the electric current of the batteries <b>18</b>, <b>18</b> are detected via the voltage detection port <b>25</b><i>c</i>, the charge port <b>25</b><i>d</i>, the temperature detection port <b>25</b><i>e </i>and the current detection port <b>25</b><i>f </i>of the battery control unit <b>25</b>. The battery control unit <b>25</b> reads out the information stored in the memory <b>25</b><i>n </i>and updates the battery residual quantity information and the use history information in conformity with the detected stages of the batteries <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>. Then, the battery residual information, the history information, the total traveled distance information, the trip traveled distance information and the clock information which are stored in the memory <b>25</b><i>n </i>are transmitted to the speed meter <b>400</b> via the communication port <b>25</b><i>o</i>. The speed meter <b>400</b> which receives this information displays the corresponding information on the respective display parts explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The battery residual quantity information is displayed on the battery residual quantity display part <b>400</b><i>a </i>and the battery residual quantity alarm display <b>400</b><i>g </i>is turned on in a given case. The total traveled distance information and the trip traveled distance information are displayed on the distance display pat <b>400</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, the driver <b>103</b> is started up with the electric power supplied from the batteries <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>, wherein the start-up signal is transmitted to the start-up input port <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the driver <b>103</b> from the start-up port <b>25</b><i>k </i>of the battery control unit <b>25</b> whereby the driver <b>103</b> is initialized. The driver <b>103</b> detects the opening of the throttle of the throttle sensor <b>77</b><i>a </i>from the throttle/push-walk input port <b>103</b><i>d </i>and drives the motor <b>100</b> in response to an angle of the opening of the throttle. The motor <b>100</b> drives the rear wheel <b>23</b> via the speed reduction mechanism <b>158</b> (see FIG. <b>7</b>). After the start-up of the motor <b>100</b>, the driver <b>103</b> detects the rotor angle using the rotor angle sensor of the motor <b>100</b> via the rotor angle input port <b>103</b><i>f </i>of the driver <b>103</b> and detects the vehicle speed pulse based on the information. The detected vehicle speed pulse is transmitted to the vehicle speed pulse port <b>25</b><i>i </i>of the battery control unit <b>25</b> from the vehicle speed pulse port <b>103</b><i>c </i>of the driver <b>103</b> and is further transmitted to the vehicle speed detector <b>25</b><i>p</i>. The vehicle speed detector <b>25</b><i>p </i>converts the received vehicle speed pulse into a vehicle speed and transmits the vehicle speed to the speed meter <b>400</b> via the communication port <b>25</b><i>o</i>. Thus, the vehicle speed is displayed on the speed display part <b>400</b><i>b </i>of the speed meter <b>400</b>. Further, the total traveled distance and the trip traveled distance are updated based on the information on the vehicle speed and the updated information is transmitted to the speed meter <b>400</b> in the same manner and is displayed on the distance display part <b>400</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, an explanation is made with respect to the push-walk control operation in the above-mentioned embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are provided for explaining, when the driver <b>103</b> performs the push-walk control and the throttle control during the push-walk control, a traveling speed flag and a push-walk speed flag which are used in the determination of conditions in these controls. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows states to which the traveling speed flag (FRUN in the drawing) is moved or changed in response to the change of the rotational speed of the motor. A point at which the state of the flag is changed from the stop state to the low-speed rotation state at the time of acceleration is indicated by NESTPH in the drawing, while a point at which the state of the flag is changed from the low-speed rotation state to the stop state at the time of deceleration is indicated by NESTPL in the drawing. In the same manner, a point at which the state of the flag is changed from a low-speed rotational state to a high-speed rotational state at the time of acceleration is indicated by NECRSH in the drawing, while a point at which the state of the flag is changed from a high-speed rotation state to a low-speed rotation state at the time of deceleration is indicated by NECRSL in the drawing. Further, when the rotational speed of the motor&lt;0, that is, when the rotation is inverted, the stop state is set in the traveling speed flag.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the transition of the state of the push-walk speed flag (FWLKV in the drawing) which determines whether the speed is a speed which allows the push-walk or not in the push-walk control. A point at which the push-walk speed flag is changed from the allowable vehicle speed to the inhibited vehicle speed at the time of acceleration is indicated by NEWLKH in the drawing and a point at which the push-walk speed flag is changed from the inhibited vehicle speed to the allowable vehicle speed at the time of deceleration is indicated by NEWLKL in the drawing. Further, when the rotational speed of the motor&lt;0, that is, when the rotation is inverted, the allowable vehicle speed is set in the push-walk speed flag.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, the push-walk control is explained in conjunction with a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. As a premise, the driver <b>103</b> always detects a value of the opening of the throttle and the pushing state of the push-walk switch from the throttle/push-walk input port <b>103</b><i>d</i>, and monitors the trouble state of the throttle sensor <b>77</b><i>a </i>and the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>based on a leak current of the coupler <b>404</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">First of all, in the start-up (step Sa<b>1</b>), the main switch <b>42</b> is started up and the push-walk control flag (FWLKC in the drawing) is set to the “inhibited” in the inside of the driver <b>103</b>. Next, the driver <b>103</b> determines the trouble state of the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>by making use of the leak current of the coupler <b>404</b><i>b </i>(step Sa<b>2</b>). When the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>suffers from some trouble, the push-walk control flag is set to the “inhibited” (step Sa<b>8</b>). When the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is not in trouble, the pushing state of the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is determined (step Sa<b>3</b>). When the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is not pushed, the push-walk control flag is set to the “inhibited” (step Sa<b>8</b>). When the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is pushed, subsequently, the driver <b>103</b> receives the information on the opening of the throttle (THRA in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) (step Sa<b>4</b>) and determines whether the value is not more than a given value (THRO) or not. Here, THRO which is a given value is an arbitrary voltage between a fully-closed voltage (for example, 0.8V) and a motor start-up voltage (for example, 0.9V) and the values equal to or below THRO exhibit the substantially fully-closed state. When the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value (THRO), the state of the push-walk control flag is maintained. When the opening of the throttle is substantially fully closed, subsequently, it is determined whether the push-walk speed flag (FWLKV in the drawing) is the allowable vehicle speed explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> or not (step Sa<b>5</b>). Since the push-walk control is driven provided that the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is continuously pushed, the driver <b>103</b> reads out and determines whether the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is pushed again after all of the above-mentioned conditions are satisfied or not (step Sa<b>6</b>). When the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is not pushed, the state of the push-walk control flag is maintained. When the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is pushed, the push-walk control flag (FWLKC in the drawing) is set to the “allowable” (step Sa<b>7</b>). Thus, the push-walk control becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the driver <b>103</b> assumes the state in which the push-walk control can be performed, the driver <b>103</b> inhibits the throttle control and starts the push-walk control. Thus, the motor <b>100</b> is driven at a given speed (for example, approximately 5 km/sec).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">On the other hand, in the push-walk control inhibition state, the driver <b>103</b> does not receive the push-walk control. That is, in the state wherein the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>is not pushed down, when the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value or when the vehicle speed is not an allowable vehicle speed, that is, the usual traveling state is estimated, the throttle control flag continues the “inhibited” state so that the driver does not receive the push-walk control.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Once the driver <b>103</b> assumes the push-walk allowable state, the determination of the opening of the throttle (THRA) and the determination of the push-walk speed flag (FWLKV) are not performed and the push-walk control is continued. However, when the push-walk switch <b>35</b><i>a </i>suffers from trouble or is removed, the push-walk control flag is set to the “inhibited.” Thus, the driver <b>103</b> stops the push-walk control.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flowchart including an explanation of the processing with respect to the control which does not sense the opening of the throttle and the vehicle speed when the driver <b>103</b> assumes the push-walk allowable state described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and the determination whether the throttle control is performed or not in response to the sitting/non-sitting state of the seat. A symbol FINH in the drawing is a flag which indicates a throttle traveling control flag, wherein when the throttle traveling control flag is set to the “allowable,” the throttle traveling is allowed and when the throttle traveling control flag indicates the “inhibited,” the throttle traveling is not performed. A symbol FSSW indicates a seat condition flag which shows the sitting state and the non-sitting state of the seat. The sitting/non-sitting states of the seat are also always detected from the seat switch input port <b>103</b><i>f </i>of the driver <b>103</b>. Since other flags are equal to the flags which are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the explanation thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">First of all, the main switch <b>42</b> is started up and the CPU of the driver <b>103</b> is reset (step Sb<b>1</b>). Thus, the throttle traveling control flag is set to the “inhibited” (step Sb<b>2</b>). Next, the state of the push-walk control flag (FWLKC) is determined (step Sb<b>3</b>). When the push-walk control flag is set to the “allowable,” the throttle traveling control flag is set to the “inhibited” and the throttle control is longer performed (step Sb<b>8</b>). When the push-walk control flag is set to the “inhibited,” the processing advances to the determination processing of the traveling speed flag (FRUN) (step Sb<b>4</b>). The traveling speed flag is set to any one of the stop state, the low-speed rotation state and the high-speed rotation speed depending on the state transition explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wherein when the traveling speed flag assumes the high-speed rotation state in the determination of the traveling speed flag (step Sb<b>4</b>), the throttle control flag is set to the “allowable” (step Sb<b>9</b>). Thus, the throttle control can be performed. When the traveling speed flag assumes the low-speed rotation state, the preceding state is continued. When the traveling speed flag assumes the stop state, the processing advances to the next determination of the sitting condition of the seat (step Sb<b>5</b>). The sitting or the non-sitting state is set in the seat state flag (FSSW) and this state is determined. When the sitting is set in the seat condition flag (FSSW), the processing advances to the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (THRA) (step Sb<b>6</b>). In the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (step Sb<b>6</b>), when the opening of the throttle is not more than the given value (THRO), the “allowable” is set in the throttle traveling control flag. Thus, the throttle control can be performed. When the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value (THRO), this state is continued. Next, when the seat condition flag is set to the non-sitting, the processing advances to the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (step Sb<b>7</b>). In the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (step Sb<b>7</b>), when the opening of the throttle is not more than the given value (THRO), the “inhibited” is set in the throttle traveling control flag, while when the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value (THRO), this state is continued. That is, to arrange the controls depending on the seat state, the throttle control can be performed only when the sitting is performed during the stop state and the throttle is substantially fully closed and when the rider leaves the seat during the stop, the throttle control is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The driver <b>103</b> continuously monitors the states of the respective flags and performs the control based on the throttle traveling when the throttle control flag is set to the “allowable” in other control parts. The driver <b>103</b>, when the throttle control flag is set to the “inhibited” and the push-walk control flag is set to the “allowable,” stops the reception of the control based on the throttle traveling, starts up the push-walk control, and drives the motor <b>100</b> at the given speed (for example, approximately 5 km/sec).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>
