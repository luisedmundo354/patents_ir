<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a baler for forming cylindrical bales of crop material, commonly referred to as a round baler, and more particularly to an improvement to round baler pickups having an intermediate stuffer mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For many years agricultural balers have been used to consolidate and package crop material so as to facilitate the storage and handling of the crop material for later use. Usually, a mower-conditioner cuts and conditions the crop material for windrow drying in the sun. When the cut crop material is properly dried, a baler is pulled along the windrows to pick up the crop material and form it into conveniently sized and shaped round bales. More specifically, the pickup of the baler gathers the cut and windrowed crop material and lifts it into the bale-forming chamber. In a typical round baler, the bale-forming chamber consists of a pair of opposing sidewalls with a series of belts that rotate and compress the crop material into a cylindrical shape. When the bale has achieved a desired size and density, the operator wraps the bale to ensure that the bale maintains its shape and density. The formed bale may be wrapped in its compact form by net, twine, or the like. The operator then raises the tailgate of the baler and ejects the bale onto the ground for subsequent handling. The tailgate is then closed and the cycle repeated as necessary and desired to manage the field of cut crop material. Utilization of rolls in combination with belts is shown by way of example in the round baler of U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,272, “Round Baler with Rollers and Belts” by Jennings.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During field operation, a pickup assembly picks up crop material, such as hay, from the ground and feeds it into a fixed or adjustable bale-forming chamber where it is rolled up to form a compact cylindrical package of hay.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Round balers commonly rely on a pickup with a set of tines that engage a windrow of crop material on the ground and lift it upwardly and then urge it rearwardly along a continuous path from the ground to a transverse opening to a bale-forming chamber. The path between the pickup tines and the opening to the bale-forming chamber is represented by a generally planar feed table. In certain configurations, the pickup tines disengage from the crop material before the material reaches the bale-forming chamber thereby creating the need for additional feed assist means, commonly referred to as a stuffer. The stuffer is a mechanism for conveying cut crop material from the pickup tines to the baling chamber. More specifically, the stuffer has a transverse array of stuffer fingers mounted on a drive assembly, typically a rotating crankshaft, so that each stuffer finger is moved along an elliptical path in a forward-rearward plane. When the cut crop material reaches the feed table and engages the array of moving stuffer fingers, the array feeds the cut crop material rearward into the bale-forming chamber through the inlet opening. Having entered the bale-forming chamber through the inlet opening the cut crop is formed into a bale by one of the several conventionally known methods.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modern farming practices require balers to operate efficiently with a range of cut crop material. Balers must be capable of engaging a common windrow of crop, lifting the crop in the windrow from the ground and transporting it to the bale-forming chamber. In order to effectively engage a common windrow, the pickup apparatus must be of sufficient width, i.e., the pickup is usually wider than the bale-forming chamber to increase the amount of cut crop that can be harvested per unit of time. Consolidating devices compress the incoming crop to near the width of the bale-forming chamber as it moves onto the feed table. Moving side-by-side fingers must be uniformly located along the width of the feed table to uniformly move crop material from the feed table into the bale-forming chamber and allow the baler to form bales having consistent crop compaction throughout. The result is that typical stuffer mechanisms have evolved in a manner that requires the stuffer crankshaft to span the entire width of the baling chamber, generally on the order of five feet, without any intermediate (mid-span) support of the internal mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Crop density in the windrow may also vary from low-density straw of hay to higher density silage grasses. The need to accommodate higher density crop materials places additional loads on the stuffer mechanism. These additional loads further contribute to stuffer crankshaft deflection that can lead to premature bearing and bushing wear and even failure of the stuffer crankshaft. Providing a mid-span support for the stuffer crankshaft using previously known techniques requires that stuffer fingers proximate to the support be eliminated thereby adversely affecting crop feed uniformity from the feed table to the bale-forming chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be a great advantage to provide a stuffer mechanism incorporating a central support for the crankshaft that allows stuffer fingers to be substantially uniformly distributed across the entire width of the stuffer mechanism. These and other advantages are provided by the stuffer mechanism described below.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a central stuffer crankshaft support that does not interfere with the stuffer feeder structure of the stuffer mechanism in a baler.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a stuffer mechanism for a round baler that uniformly moves a mat of crop material from a pickup apparatus to a bale-forming chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a stuffer mechanism for a round baler that includes an array of uniformly narrowly spaced, moving feeder fingers to move crop material across the stuffer mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an additional centrally-located crankshaft support having a width less than the gap between adjacent feeder fingers in a stuffer mechanism for a round baler that includes an array of uniformly narrowly spaced, moving feeder fingers to move crop material across the stuffer mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an improved stuffer mechanism that is durable in construction, inexpensive of manufacture, carefree of maintenance, easily assembled, and simple and effective to use.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other objects are achieved by providing an improved stuffer mechanism for a baler having an array of feeder fingers uniformly spaced across a stuffer feeder table and a centrally located support bearing for the stuffer feeder finger crankshaft that does not disrupt the uniform feeder finger spacing.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Many of the fastening, connection, processes and other means and components utilized in this invention are widely known and used in the field of the invention described, and their exact nature or type is not necessary for an understanding and use of the invention by a person skilled in the art, and they will not therefore be discussed in significant detail. Also, any reference herein to the terms “left” or “right,” “up” or “down,” or “top” or “bottom” are used as a matter of mere convenience, and are determined by standing at the rear of the machine facing in its normal direction of travel. Furthermore, the various components shown or described herein for any specific application of this invention can be varied or altered as anticipated by this invention and the practice of a specific application of any element may already be widely known or used in the art by persons skilled in the art and each will likewise not therefore be discussed in significant detail.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a round baler <b>10</b> having a frame <b>12</b>, a hitch <b>14</b>, a pickup assembly <b>20</b>, a bale-forming chamber <b>90</b> and a pair of supporting wheels <b>16</b> enabling the baler to be towed along the ground by a tractor or other similar prime mover. As baler <b>10</b> is towed across a field, pick up tines <b>24</b> lift crop material, usually in a windrow, from the ground and move the crop material onto a crop feeding transition area <b>26</b> at the rearward portion of pickup assembly <b>20</b>. This feeding is done either directly, such as in a case for crop material aligned with the center of the pickup assembly <b>20</b>, or indirectly, through the operation of crop transition elements such as auger screws <b>28</b> and crop deflecting plate <b>29</b>. Auger screws <b>28</b> converge the material from the full width of the pickup assembly <b>20</b> and urge it toward the central portion of the pickup assembly <b>20</b>, establishing a mat width of crop material matching the desired bale width, typically around four or five feet.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Immediately rearward from the crop feeding transition area <b>26</b> is stuffer apparatus <b>30</b>. The stuffer apparatus <b>30</b> engages the crop material moving rearwardly from pickup assembly <b>20</b> and feeds it rearwardly into the bale-forming chamber <b>90</b>. The crop material fed into the chamber <b>90</b> is continuously rolled to form a cylindrical package of the crop material. This formation of a cylindrical package takes place in a well-known manner, as generally described above, after which the package is wrapped and discharged through a tailgate (not shown) in the rear portion of the bale-forming chamber <b>90</b>. Once a bale is discharged, the tailgate is closed and the baler <b>10</b> is again ready to form another bale. The bale forming process is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,044,272, “Round Baler With Rollers and Belts,” incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> where shown is a stuffer apparatus <b>30</b> as adapted to the structure of the above described round baler is depicted in further detail. The stuffer apparatus <b>30</b> is of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,055, “Pickup Apparatus for a Round Baler,” in which the present invention is useful and shown in its preferred embodiment. It should be noted that it is not intended that its use be limited to balers of this specific nature, but that the present invention is adaptable for use on most, if not all, current round balers. U.S. Pat. No. 6,651,418, “Modular Pickup, Stuffer, and Rotor” illustrates one such example. These patents are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Stuffer apparatus <b>30</b> includes stuffer frame <b>32</b>, which supports the stuffer apparatus and provides fixtures to connect the stuffer apparatus to the baler frame. Stuffer frame <b>32</b> includes two separate end plates <b>34</b> connected to stuffer frame <b>32</b> on opposing ends of the stuffer apparatus <b>30</b> and generally define the transverse width of the stuffer apparatus <b>30</b>, shown as dimension “A” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Feed table <b>40</b> is also connected to stuffer frame <b>32</b> to form a generally planar surface for supporting crop material as it moves across the stuffer apparatus <b>30</b>. Feed table <b>40</b> comprises a plurality of side-by-side members <b>42</b> oriented generally parallel to the direction of crop movement, shown as direction arrow “B,” and arranged along the transverse width of the feed table <b>40</b> to form a plurality of longitudinally oriented slot-like openings <b>43</b> generally spanning the transverse width of the stuffer apparatus <b>30</b>. A plurality of movable feeder fingers <b>46</b> extends through the slot-like openings <b>43</b> to engage the crop material then present and urge it rearwardly toward the bale-forming chamber <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The motion of feeder fingers <b>46</b> is caused by rotation of crankshaft <b>50</b>. Crankshaft <b>50</b> is rotatably disposed along central axis of rotation <b>52</b> within stuffer apparatus <b>30</b> and supported at opposite ends by end plates <b>34</b> by bearings or other such suitable rotational support mechanism. Rotational input to crankshaft <b>50</b> is directed through a power transmission apparatus (not shown) for baler <b>10</b>, which is, in turn, typically powered by the PTO of a tractor to which the baler is connected. Rotation of the stuffer crankshaft <b>50</b> is coordinated with other well-known actions within the baler, such as crop pickup and bale forming, that those skilled in the art will recognize. As the crankshaft <b>50</b> rotates, rotational direction shown as arrow “C,” a portion of feeder fingers <b>46</b> pass from the below feed table <b>40</b>, through the forward portion of longitudinal openings <b>43</b>, to above the plane of feed table <b>30</b> where they engage the crop material present. Further rotation of crankshaft <b>50</b> moves the feeder fingers <b>46</b> rearwardly with a portion thereof remaining above the plane feed table <b>40</b> moving the crop material rearwardly as well. As the feeder fingers <b>46</b> near the rearward portion of longitudinal openings <b>43</b>, the reciprocating motion caused by crankshaft <b>50</b> causes the portion of feeder fingers previously extended above the plane of feed table <b>40</b> to move below the plane of feeder table <b>40</b>. Continued rotation of crankshaft <b>50</b> causes the feeder fingers <b>46</b> to return to the forward portion of the longitudinal openings while remaining below the plane of the feed table <b>40</b> where they will not engage crop material, and the process begins anew.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Optimal baler performance is achieved when the stuffer apparatus supplies a generally uniform mat of crop material to the bale-forming chamber. To this end, the feeder fingers <b>46</b> spanning the transverse width of the stuffer apparatus <b>30</b> are uniformly spaced across the transverse width. Finger-to-finger spacing, shown as dimension “D,” varies among various baler designs, but in general, closer spacing yields better stuffer performance; a finger-to-finger spacing interval of less than four inches in typical. In the baler in which the present invention is useful, the finger-to-finger spacing interval is two and five-eights inches. Due to the small feeder finger spacing intervals, conventional stuffer crankshafts are typically simply supported (e.g., having only two main crankshaft bearings) at either end as there is little space between the ends where the feeder fingers are located. Relying on crankshaft end-support along becomes problematic as the width of the stuffer assembly increases. Incorporating an additional crankshaft support mid-length typically requires eliminating one or more feeder fingers from the transverse array which negatively affects stuffer performance and, ultimately, bale-forming quality. The present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, incorporates an additional crankshaft support structure <b>60</b> that fits within the feeder finger spacing interval.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, crankshaft support structure <b>60</b> is shown in additional detail comprising a support plate <b>62</b>, containing a bearing housing <b>64</b> and bearing <b>66</b>. Also shown are two crank arm plates <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> which are part of crankshaft <b>50</b> and connected to each other by connector shaft <b>56</b>. Support plate <b>62</b> connects to the stuffer frame <b>32</b> to provide a structural connection between crankshaft support structure <b>60</b> and the crankshaft end bearings located in end plates <b>34</b>. Bearing housing <b>64</b> connects to and penetrates support plate <b>62</b> generally perpendicularly to the planar surface of the plate along the central axis of rotation <b>52</b> of crankshaft <b>50</b>. Bearing housing <b>64</b> is a tube-like structure configured to receive a conventional bearing <b>66</b>. In the preferred embodiment, bearing <b>66</b> is a spherical, self-aligning bearing to ease crankshaft <b>50</b> alignment along central axis of rotation <b>52</b> and to avoid unintentional stress load on crankshaft <b>50</b> due to mirror misalignment. Other forms of self-aligning bearings are envisioned may be substituted with similar result. The outer diameter of bearing <b>55</b> is such that there is a slight interference fit with the inner diameter of bearing housing <b>64</b> thereby retaining bearing <b>55</b> in place. Connector shaft <b>56</b> extends axially through bearing <b>66</b> along central axis of rotation <b>52</b>. Connector shaft <b>56</b> is similarly press-fit into the inner race diameter of bearing <b>66</b> so that connector shaft <b>56</b> is axially secured. Each end of connector shaft <b>56</b> extending away from the opposing faces of bearing <b>66</b> include a spline <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> for connecting to crank arm plates <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> in a manner that causes the crank arm plates and the connector shaft to rotate in unison. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it can be observed that the spline connections between the connector shaft <b>56</b> and crank arm plates <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> will allow the crank arm plates to move slightly axially along central axis of rotation <b>52</b>. Proper transverse alignment is maintained by the overall crankshaft mounting within the stuffer mechanism which restrains overall transverse movement along central axis of rotation by bearings located in end plates <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows the spatial relation between the stuffer feeder fingers <b>46</b> and crankshaft support structure <b>60</b>. Crankshaft <b>50</b> includes at least two crankpins <b>80</b> aligned on orbital axes of rotation <b>54</b>. Orbital axes of rotation <b>54</b> rotate about central axis of rotation <b>52</b> as crankshaft <b>50</b> rotates. The motion of crankpins <b>80</b> causes a reciprocating motion in feeder fingers <b>46</b>. Crankshafts and the numerous types motion that may be caused by them are generally well-known. In the present invention, crankshaft <b>50</b> comprises two crankpins <b>80</b> arranged opposite, that is, 180 degrees of crankshaft rotation apart. Each crankpin spans approximately one half of the transverse width of the stuffer apparatus so that the crankshaft is generally symmetrical. Other crankshaft configurations, such as those having three, four, or more crankpins, are not precluded by this invention; however, such elaborate crankshafts are not generally employed in common stuffer mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Rotatably connected on each crankpin <b>80</b> is a feeder finger base <b>82</b>, extending generally the length of the crankpin <b>80</b> and providing an attachment point for an array of feeder fingers <b>46</b>. Feeder fingers <b>46</b> are generally uniformly spaced along the length of base <b>82</b>, with the spacing interval coinciding with the spacing of longitudinal openings <b>43</b> on feeder table <b>40</b>. Though not shown, a connecting link extending from base <b>82</b> to a connection point on stuffer frame <b>32</b> prevents base <b>82</b> from rotating uncontrollably on crankpin <b>80</b> and provides an additional component to the oscillatory motion of the feeder fingers <b>46</b>, which increases stuffer mechanism effectiveness. Refer to described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,055, “Pickup Apparatus for a Round Baler,” for additional description of the feeder finger motion as caused by the above described mechanism. The operation of rotating crank stuffer mechanisms is generally well-known and not described in further detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to avoid disrupting the uniform spacing interval of feeder fingers <b>46</b>, crankshaft support structure <b>60</b> is of compact design. The design of support structure <b>60</b> is to handle primarily radial crankshaft loads of the type that can lead to excessive crankshaft deflection if left unrestrained. The splined interface between crank arm plates <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> and connector shaft <b>56</b> utilizes an involute spline design that allows the portions of crankshaft <b>50</b> disposed on either side of crankshaft support structure <b>60</b> slight axial displacement, crankshaft support structure <b>60</b> provides little resistance to such displacement. Similarly, the use of a self-aligning bearing <b>66</b> provides a tolerance for minor alignment imperfections and prevents such imperfections from causing additional stresses in the crankshaft during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be understood that changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention will occur to and may be made by those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure within the principles and scope of the invention. The foregoing description illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention; however, concepts, as based upon the description, may be employed in other embodiments without departing from the scope of the inventions.</p>
