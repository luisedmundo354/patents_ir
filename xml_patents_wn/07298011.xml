<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates in general to semiconductor manufacturing. More particularly, it relates to a semiconductor device with improved sidewall spacers and a method for fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Silicides are commonly used to reduce the gate resistance and the source/drain resistance between adjacent gate electrodes. As the physical geometry of semiconductor devices shrinks, however, the spacing between gate electrodes shrinks as well. The available space for silicide formation shrinks faster than the ground rules for gate-to-gate spacing due to the finite width of the gate spacers. Thus, the formation of silicide in narrow spaces between gates becomes more difficult, leading to an elevated and variable resistance in these regions. Furthermore, dry etching of conventional sidewall spacers is difficult to control and can result in variations in spacer width between adjacent gates. These variations in spacer width further result in poor resistance uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a cross-section of a partially completed semiconductor device is shown. Two transistor gate patterns <b>12</b> are formed overlying the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The gate patterns <b>12</b> include a gate electrode <b>14</b> overlying a gate dielectric <b>16</b>. An oxide liner layer <b>18</b> and a silicon nitride layer <b>20</b> are deposited in sequence overlying the gate patterns <b>12</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. Note that the silicon nitride layer <b>20</b> is much thicker than the oxide liner layer <b>18</b>. For example, for 80 nm node design rule, the thicknesses of the silicon nitride layer <b>20</b> and the oxide liner layer <b>18</b> are about 650 Å and 130 Å, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, conventional spacer etching is performed to provide an L-shaped oxide spacer <b>18</b><i>a </i>and a thicker nitride spacer <b>20</b><i>a</i>. After formation of source/drain regions <b>22</b>, silicides <b>24</b> are formed on the exposed surface of the gate electrode <b>14</b> and the source/drain regions <b>22</b>. As the available spaced for silicide formation is determined by the spacer widths, the variations in spacer width will result in poor resistance uniformity. With the conventional spacer scheme of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, however, large variations in spacer width during spacer etching often necessitates complex process tuning. A novel spacer scheme with better width control is desirable. It is also desirable to reduce the spacer width to enlarge the space for silicide formation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another problem associated with conventional spacers is limited top loss. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, only a trivial sidewall portion of the gate electrode <b>14</b> is exposed after the spacer dry etching. With the finite exposed area, silicide is difficult to form to provide a high-performance transistor. It would be advantageous for the gate electrode to have a larger area for silicidation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows yet another problem with conventional spacers. A contact hole <b>30</b> is etched though an inter-level dielectric (ILD) layer <b>28</b> and a contact etch stop layer <b>26</b> to expose the source/drain regions <b>22</b>. As the stop layer <b>26</b> is typically silicon nitride, the nitride spacer <b>20</b><i>a </i>is laterally etched during the contact etching process for removal of the stop layer <b>26</b>, leading to undercut <b>30</b><i>a</i>. The lateral etch poses reliability risks especially when the contact hole <b>30</b> is misaligned.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the following, a preferred embodiment of the invention will be described by referring to formation of sidewall spacers on a gate pattern of a field effect transistor. It will be appreciated, however, that the invention is applicable to any conductor pattern in an integrated circuit, for example, local interconnection or other polysilicon lines for connecting individual semiconductor elements. In this specification, expressions such as “overlying the substrate”, “above the layer”, or “on the film” simply denote a relative positional relationship with respect to the surface of the base layer, regardless of the existence of intermediate layers. Accordingly, these expressions may indicate not only the direct contact of layers, but also, a non-contact state of one or more laminated layers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is provided with a transistor gate pattern <b>102</b> thereon. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, only one gate pattern is shown for the sake of clarity though adjacent gate patterns are typically present. The semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is understood to possibly include silicon, strained silicon, silicon germanium (SiGe), silicon on insulator (SOI), or other suitable materials. The gate pattern <b>102</b> typically includes a gate electrode <b>106</b> overlying a gate dielectric <b>104</b>. The gate dielectric <b>104</b> typically comprises silicon oxide, and the gate electrode <b>106</b> typically comprises doped polysilicon, often referred to simply as polysilicon.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Lightly doped source and drain (LDD) regions (not shown) may be formed by implanting impurity ions into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> prior to forming the sidewall spacers of the invention. The implant can be performed using the gate pattern <b>102</b> as an implant mask as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an important aspect of the invention is shown. A first insulating layer <b>108</b> and a second insulating layer <b>110</b> are conformally deposited overlying the gate pattern <b>102</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, with the first insulating layer <b>108</b> being thicker than the second insulating layer <b>110</b>. The thickness ratio of the first insulating layer to the second insulating layer is at least 2:1, preferably 2-4:1. For example, for 80 nm node technology, the thicknesses of the first and second insulating layers <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are about 350-450 Å and about 100-200 Å, respectively. Preferably in this embodiment, the first insulating layer is silicon oxide deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the reactant gas, and the second insulating layer is silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride deposited by LPCVD. It will be appreciated, however, that the first and second insulating layers may be made of any materials having etch selectivity with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another important feature of the invention is shown. The first and the second insulating layers <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are fabricated into a recessed L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a </i>and a top spacer <b>110</b><i>a</i>, respectively. First, the second insulating layer <b>110</b> is anisotropically etched to form the top spacer <b>110</b><i>a </i>on sidewalls of the first insulating layer <b>108</b>. Next, using the spacer <b>110</b><i>a </i>as an etch mask, the first insulating layer <b>108</b> is anisotropically etched to form an L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a </i>positioned between the gate pattern <b>102</b> and the spacer <b>110</b><i>a</i>. In particular, the first insulating layer <b>108</b> is anisotropically etched down to reduce the vertical thickness thereof, thereby exposing a substantial portion of the upper sidewall <b>102</b><i>a</i>, for example, about 200-400 Å. The L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a </i>includes a vertical portion V between the gate pattern <b>102</b> and the top spacer <b>110</b><i>a</i>, and a horizontal portion H extending under the top spacer <b>110</b><i>a</i>. The etching process for forming the L-shaped spacer is preferably carried out by a recipe having an etch selectivity with respective to the first insulating layer <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Compared to the conventional spacer process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the spacer process of the invention may provide many advantages. First, the thicker first insulating layer <b>108</b> enables easy removal of the top portion of the L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a</i>. The L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a </i>therefore can be recessed to expose a substantial sidewall portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the gate pattern <b>102</b>, providing a larger silicide reaction area in a subsequent process. According to the invention, the ratio of the width X of the vertical portion V of the L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a </i>to the height Y of the exposed sidewalls <b>102</b><i>a </i>is preferably about 1-2:1.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Second, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the spacer profile is now determined by a thinner second insulating layer <b>110</b>. Compared to the thick nitride layer <b>20</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be deposited with a more uniform thickness across a process wafer, and result in a short etching time or allow a lower etching power for the spacer etching process, thereby reducing variations in spacer widths. Accordingly, the spacer widths of the invention can be better controlled, and the resistance uniformity between adjacent gates can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Third, as the spacer widths are better controlled, a lower margin is required for spacer etching. Thus, the total thickness of the spacer layers, i.e., layers <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, can be reduced to gain more space for silicidation between adjacent gates. This is particularly desirable when the gate spacing is reduced with the design rule. For example, for silicon oxide as the first insulating layer <b>108</b> and silicon nitride as the second insulating layer <b>110</b>, the conventional approach of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> requires a total thickness of 780 Å (oxide/nitride=130 Å/650 Å) for gate spacing of 1630 Å, while the invention only requires a total thickness of 530 Å (oxide/nitride=400 Å/130 Å) for the same design rule, saving about 30% thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the invention therefore includes a gate pattern <b>102</b> on a semiconductor device <b>10</b>. An L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a </i>is provided adjacent to the gate pattern <b>102</b>, comprising a vertical portion V and a horizontal portion H. The vertical portion V is on lower sidewalls of the gate pattern <b>102</b>, exposing upper sidewalls <b>102</b><i>a </i>thereof. A top spacer <b>110</b><i>a </i>abuts the L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a</i>, protruding above the same, thus providing a gap between the top spacer <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the upper sidewalls <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the gate pattern. The width ratio of the vertical portion V of the L-shaped spacer to the top spacer <b>110</b><i>a </i>is at least about 2:1 (X/W), preferably about 2-4:1. The width X of the vertical portion V to the height Y of the exposed upper sidewalls <b>102</b><i>a </i>is about 1-2:1 (X/Y).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, following the formation of spacers <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>a</i>, source/drain regions <b>112</b> are formed in the substrate <b>100</b> oppositely adjacent to the gate pattern <b>102</b> by ion implantation. Subsequently, a gate silicide layer <b>116</b> and a junction silicide layer <b>114</b> are formed on the gate pattern <b>102</b> and the source/drain regions <b>112</b> by methods well known in the art. The silicide layers <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> may comprise CoSi<sub>2</sub>, TiSi<sub>2</sub>, WSi<sub>2</sub>, NiSi<sub>2</sub>, MoSi<sub>2</sub>, TaSi<sub>2</sub>, or PtSi, for example. As discussed above, a sufficient silicidation area may be secured because the top surface of the L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a </i>is recessed to expose upper sidewalls <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the gate pattern <b>102</b>, and also because the space between two adjacent gates is more open. As a result, the silicide layers <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are more stably formed, and the gate silicide layer <b>116</b> is thicker than in the case of a non-recessed spacer <b>18</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref> illustrate another advantage provided by the preferred embodiment of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, following the formation of the silicide layers <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, a contact etch stop layer <b>118</b> and an ILD layer <b>120</b> are deposited covering the entire substrate. The etch stop layer <b>118</b> is typically silicon nitride and the ILD layer <b>120</b> is typically oxide or low dielectric constant materials. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a contact opening <b>122</b> is etched down to the source/drain region <b>112</b> by conventional anisotropic etching. During removal of the nitride stop layer <b>118</b> from the source/drain regions <b>112</b>, the horizontal portion H of the L-shaped spacer <b>108</b><i>a</i>, if oxide has been used, functions as an etch stop and inhibits lateral etching. Accordingly, only limited undercut, if any, is present under the top spacer <b>110</b><i>a</i>. In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of the width-U of the undercut to the height Z of the horizontal portion is less than about 0.3 (U/Z).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In view of the foregoing, it is readily appreciated that the present invention provides a simple and well-controlled spacer scheme to increase the area for silicide formation. Also, it may allow the spacer process down to the next generation design rule by reducing the spacer thickness. Further, the resulting spacer is less susceptible to undercut by lateral etching. Finally, The invention does not increase complexity of the spacer process. In the most simple way, it may merely change the thickness ratio of the spacer insulating layers of the current spacer scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. To the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements (as would be apparent to those skilled in the art). Therefore, the scope of the appended claims should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements.</p>
