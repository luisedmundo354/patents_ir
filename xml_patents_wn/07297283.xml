<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to fluid purification systems, and more specifically, to containers having a nanostructured adsorption material for removing particulates and/or contaminants from fluid.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Water quality has recently become a major concern for many people whether it is for life style reasons or health reasons. The public has become aware of the potential negative health effects associated with chlorination for disinfecting water, as well as the presence of trace quantities of heavy metals, such as lead, copper and zinc or particulates, including impure compounds, elements, and other contaminants exceeding the prescribed limits that is intended for human consumption. Moreover, consumers are increasingly seeking out better tasting water than what the local municipal water supply can provide. Consumers searching for an alternative source for substantially pure or better tasting water have caused a tremendous increase in the consumption of commercial bottled water recently, pushing sales into the billions of dollars per year.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To combat the high costs of bottled water, many are turning to a variety of water filtration products. The most popular styles being the pour through carafe. These pour through carafes are often pitcher-like in design and are made to be easily handled. They can usually hold from one to two liters of water and can be tipped for pouring. Other designs have been made available over the years to remove particulates, including impure compounds and elements, and/or contaminants from fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 703,654 discloses a canteen having two separate chambers enclosed within the canteen for filtered and unfiltered water. A filtering media is placed between the two chambers and an air-pump is connected to the chamber for unfiltered water. The air-pump is used to force unfiltered water through the filtering media into the chamber for filtered water.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The U.S. Pat. No. 4,800,018 discloses a simplified portable water purification system that provides an unfiltered water receiving compartment, a disposable filter cartridge, and a filtered water reservoir all in a single container. The disposable filter cartridge is horizontally positioned centrally and divides the container into the two compartments. Contaminated and unfiltered water is poured into the top receiving compartment of the container and is allowed to pass through filtering materials in the disposable filter cartridge into the reservoir below.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The U.S. Pat. No. 5,149,437 discloses a device that includes a filter housing having an inlet at one end for water to be purified and an outlet for purified water at an opposing end. The filter device including in sequence first, second and third layers of purification material. The first layer of purification material includes metallic particles for establishing a suitable redox potential in the first layer. The second layer of purification material includes activated carbon. The third layer of purification material includes a weak acid ion exchange resin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,830 discloses an apparatus filtering drinking water which includes a lower non-porous container to receive the filtrate. An upper vessel closed at its lower end by a high density ceramic filter is stacked in nested relationship to the lower container. When water containing contaminants and pollutants is poured into the filter vessel, it drips through the ceramic filter under gravitational forces and is stored in the lower receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The U.S. Pat. No. 5,562,824 discloses a gravity percolation water purifier assembly. The assembly includes a covered storage container having a dispensing spigot. A flanged filtration chamber is supported beneath the cover to receive untreated water. A porous filter cartridge is sealed to an outlet port. A purifier cartridge is threaded to the outlet port and supports multiple fibrous spacers and treatment chambers containing beds of treatment media, including a multi-valent iodine media, granular activated carbon, and a halogen scavenger media. In one purification cartridge, water passes from multiple inlet ports at an inlet bore through adjoining centric chambers and to the storage container via outlet ports at the periphery of the purifier cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,448 discloses a container having two chambers separated by a filter. One of the chambers is capable of being compressed so as to pressurize a volume of water to be filtered in the chamber. Upon applying pressure, the water is forced through the filter into the second chamber where it is stored for use in a clean and drinkable form. The filter includes a series of discs arranged to effectively remove particulate, chemical and other undesired contents of the water. The filtered water may be filtered to the molecular level providing an essentially sterile drinking water.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The U.S. Pat No. 6,117,332 discloses a feeder insert for a tubular water filtration cartridge utilized in household point of use water filtration systems. The feeder insert allows a chemical to be fed into a incoming water supply at a controlled rate by employing a bypass system that allows a predetermined amount of incoming water to flow past the feed chemical without contacting the chemical. The amount of water in the bypass flow can also be manually adjusted through the use of two adjustment mechanisms, an adjustable ring and a rotatable end cap, located on the feeder insert.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The U.S. Pat. No. 6,344,146 discloses an integrated water purification device which includes a receptacle modified to accommodate a filtration assembly for purifying water, and to store water following purification. The receptacle provides separate openings for water intake, and water outflow. The filtration assembly includes a pump and a multistage filter cartridge. Pump action draws water into the water purification device and forces the water though the multistage filter and into the receptacle. Purified water may be stored in the receptacle until consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The U.S. Pat No. 6,733,669 discloses a water purification system having a watertight polymeric container having an upper unfiltered water receiving chamber and a lower filtered water chamber. A disposable filter cartridge is provided between the chambers. This allows for gravity induced filtering through cartridge as opposed to pressure induced filtering.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above referenced systems are designed to filter water by way of a flow-through process utilizing either gravity or pressure. In addition, with these systems, a mechanism is not readily available to determine the level of particulates removed by the filter, as well as whether the filter can still remove particulates. Accordingly, it is desirable provide a system for removing particulate from water that not only can display the level of contaminants removed, but whether contaminants can still be removed by a particulate removal mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention described herein relates to a container designed for purification of fluid for consumption by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic, and particulate matters from the fluid. In one embodiment of the present invention, the container includes a compartment into which a volume of fluid to be treated may be placed, and a chamber for receiving treated fluid from the compartment. The container may also include a porous matrix positioned within the compartment for entrapment of the particulates and/or contaminants upon surface contact between the fluid and the porous matrix. In one embodiment, the porous matrix includes a nanostructured adsorption material and may be embedded on the interior surface of the receptacle. Alternatively, the porous matrix may be placed onto the interior surface of the receptacle as a thin film, coating, layer or as a sheet of material. The container may further include a sensor in communication with the porous matrix, so as to detect levels of particulates and/or contaminants adsorbed on the matrix or quantity of particulates and/or contaminants removed from the fluid to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention also provides a method for purification of fluid by removing unwanted particulates and/or contaminants from a fluid. In one embodiment, a compartment for accommodating a fluid to be treated may be provided. A porous matrix having nanoscaled pores may be placed within the compartment. A chamber for receiving the treated fluid from the compartment may be positioned in alignment the compartment. The fluid to be treated may next be introduced into the compartment. Thereafter, movement of the fluid within the compartment may be initiated, for example, as it drains into the chamber. Upon surface contact between the fluid and the porous matrix, the particulates and/or contaminants may be directed within the porous matrix and trapped therein. If there is no movement of fluid within the compartment, the contaminants may still removed by slow molecular displacement or diffusion into the porous matrix. In an embodiment, levels of contaminants removed from the fluid may be indicated, as well as whether the ability of the porous matrix to remove additional contaminants has been exhausted.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention provides, in one embodiment, a container having a filtration system designed to purify fluid to be consumed. In particular, the filtration system acts to remove particulates, such as impure and undesirable constituents, contaminants, such as microorganisms, biological contaminants, organic and inorganic compounds and elements, and/or matters or substances ranging from about 1 nanometer (nm) to about 100 nm or larger from a fluid, for instance water, so that the resulting treated or purified fluid will be safe to consume. In other words, the purified or treated fluid is provided with a level of contaminants not exceeding the prescribed limit intended for human consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-B</figref>, there is shown a container <b>10</b> having a compartment <b>11</b> within which a volume of fluid to be treated may be placed, and a chamber <b>12</b> into which a volume of treated fluid may exit from the compartment <b>11</b> and be accommodated therein. The compartment <b>11</b>, in an embodiment, may be positioned within the chamber <b>12</b> against a wall <b>13</b> of container <b>10</b>. To receive fluid to be treated, the compartment <b>11</b> may be provided with an inlet end <b>111</b>. Inlet end <b>111</b>, in one embodiment, may be an opening <b>112</b> of any size and/or shape, so long as it is capable of permitting fluid to be treated to be introduced into the compartment <b>11</b>. The compartment <b>11</b> may also be provided with an outlet end <b>113</b> spatially positioned below the inlet end <b>111</b> of the compartment <b>11</b>. The outlet end <b>113</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, may be designed to permit treated fluid from the compartment <b>11</b> to drain from the compartment <b>11</b> into the chamber <b>12</b> of container <b>10</b>. To this end, the compartment <b>11</b>, in an embodiment, may be sufficiently spaced from a bottom end <b>14</b> of container <b>10</b>. However, to minimize the rate of outflow of fluid from the compartment <b>11</b> prior to its treatment, outlet end <b>113</b> may be designed in such a manner so as to permit the fluid to remain within the compartment <b>11</b> for a period of time sufficient for treatment. In one embodiment, outlet end <b>113</b> may include at least one opening <b>114</b>. Alternatively, outlet end <b>113</b> may include a plurality of openings <b>114</b> or a perforated surface (not shown). To the extent desired, the opening or openings <b>114</b> may be provided with any geometric shape or may be positioned relatively to one another in any manner, so long as the fluid can remain within the compartment <b>11</b> for a sufficient amount of time for treatment. Moreover, if desired, a plate (not shown) may be situated across the outlet end <b>113</b> to prevent fluid from draining from the compartment <b>11</b> until the plate is removed. To that end, the length of time over which the fluid may be treated within the compartment <b>11</b> may be controlled. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To facilitate migration of treated fluid from within the compartment <b>11</b> toward outlet end <b>113</b>, the compartment <b>11</b> may be designed, in an embodiment, to taper from the inlet <b>111</b> towards the outlet end <b>113</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In this manner, as treated fluid drains from the compartment <b>11</b> across opening <b>114</b> at the outlet end <b>113</b> into chamber <b>12</b>, the taper design may also minimize the amount of treated fluid remaining within the compartment <b>11</b>. Of course, other designs may be employed when designing the compartment <b>11</b>, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To treat the fluid within the compartment <b>11</b>, the system <b>10</b> may include, in one embodiment, a porous matrix <b>20</b>, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, positioned within the compartment <b>11</b> along its interior surfaces for the removal of particulates and/or contaminants from the fluid. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, porous matrix <b>20</b> may include a nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> having a large volume of pores <b>23</b>. In addition, the porous matrix <b>20</b> may be provided with a fluid contact surface <b>24</b> against or across which fluid within the chamber <b>12</b> may flow, and a substantially fluid impermeable surface <b>25</b> across which fluid within the porous matrix <b>20</b> and chamber <b>12</b> cannot pass. Pores <b>23</b>, in one embodiment, may be nanoscale in size, ranging from about 1 nanometer (nm) to about 100 nm. In this manner, particles and/or contaminants ranging from about 1 nm to about 10 nm or larger can be removed from the fluid. The pores <b>23</b> may include a total volume ranging from about 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g to about 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g. In a preferred embodiment, the total volume of pores <b>23</b> may range from about 0.8 cm<sup>3</sup>/g to about 0.95 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, with a total specific surface area ranging from at least approximately 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g to approximately 3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and higher.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may include, in one embodiment, a plurality of layers <b>22</b>, each having pores <b>23</b> within a predetermined size range. In such an embodiment, layers <b>22</b> may be arranged so that the pores <b>23</b> in each successive layer <b>22</b> get successively smaller in size, moving from the layer immediately adjacent the contact surface <b>24</b> to the layer immediately adjacent the substantially impermeable surface <b>25</b>. In this manner, smaller particulates and/or contaminants may be permitted to move through the larger pores adjacent the contact surface <b>24</b> and into the smaller pores adjacent the substantially impermeable surface <b>25</b> where they can be trapped and retained.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may be designed without distinctive layers <b>22</b>, such that pores <b>23</b> of various nanoscale size ranges may be interspersed throughout the entire nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b>. Although not illustrated, it should be appreciated that the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may be provided with a plurality of layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, while each layer may include pores <b>23</b> of various nanoscale size ranges interspersed therein, similar to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The porous matrix <b>20</b> used in connection with the system <b>10</b> of the present invention may, in one embodiment, be formed from, for instance, porous char generated from various starting materials, for example, discarded or used automobile tires or other materials that can generate a relatively high fixed carbon content within the porous char. Of course, new automobile tires or similar starting materials may also be used to generated the porous char. In one embodiment, the starting materials may be heated in a reactor, within which the environment may be controlled, initially from room temperature to about 250° C. to 300° C. During this initial heating period, a mixture of condensable and non-condensable gases may be given off from the starting material within the reactor. This mixture of gases, which can be captured for reintroduction at a later stage, can typically include approximately 25%-35% carbon dioxide, approximately 10%-15% carbon monoxide, approximately 5%-10% methane, approximately 1%-5% volatile acids, with the remaining portion containing a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, hydrocarbons, i.e., organic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Upon the reaching between 250° C. to 300° C., an exothermic reaction can occur within the reactor pushing the temperature of the reactor and thus the resulting porous char to temperatures ranging from about 500° C. to about 600° C. During this period, the previously captured condensable and non-condensable gases may be reintroduced into the reactor for exposure to the porous char. The resulting porous char may contain, at this stage, mostly macro-pores and may only be moderately dense in nature. To subsequently obtain a nanostructured adsorption material, this moderately dense porous char must be transformed to a relatively high-density material with a relatively high fixed carbon content.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To generate a relatively high fixed carbon content in the porous char, impurities present in the starting materials, and in the transformed material, i.e., porous char, may be removed, using known procedures, at various stages during the conversion process to produce a fixed carbon content in the porous char of greater than about 90% to about 95%. It should be noted that, on average, approximately 20 pounds of starting material, e.g., used tires, will yield about 4 pounds of porous char with a fixed carbon content of between 90% to 95%. Once the condensable and non-condensable gases have been reintroduced into the reactor, the temperature within the reactor may be increased so that the porous char may be heated at a relatively high temperature range of from about 1000° C. to about 1100° C. to enlarge the pores within the porous char. During this stage, a controlled mixture of steam and air may be introduced into the reactor. In one embodiment, for approximately 1 pound of porous char, from about 1.0 pound to about 1.5 pounds of steam and air mixture may be injected into the reactor. The amount of steam and air may vary depending upon how much the pores within the porous char are to be enlarged, and could vary from about 0.5 pounds to over 2.0 pounds per pound of porous char. The introduction of steam and air into the reactor, in one embodiment, can generate a producer gas in the presence of the hot porous char. The content of the producer gas may vary, but can contain about 15%-20% hydrogen, 20%-25% carbon monoxide, with the remainder a mixture of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and other organic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">By exposing the porous char to such a temperature range and a mixture of steam and air, the porous char may be transformed into a relatively high density nanostructured material having the desired porosity. Typically, approximately 1 pound of the high density nanostructured material can be generated from the 4 pounds of the porous char. The exposure of the porous char to such high temperature, in addition to enlarging and generating pores of various nanoscale sizes, can provide the resulting nanostructured adsorption material with internal surface areas ranging from at least approximately 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g to approximately 3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and higher.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The resulting nanostructured material, similar to nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref>, may be used in connection with the porous matrix <b>20</b> of the present invention. It should be noted that the process of enlarging the pores structure to specific nanoscale ranges, along with the removal of impurities within the porous char can impart special properties to the nanostructured material. In particular, such a process can impart the nanostructured material with adsorption properties necessary for removal of particulates and contaminants.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition to the size of the nanoscale pores, the ability of nanostructured material to adsorb particulates and contaminant molecules can also be dependent upon the structure of the nanoscale pores, the total surface area, the carbon particle size, and the void space between carbon particles. Specifically, as the nanostructured adsorption material, such as item <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, essentially comprises nanocarbon particles <b>26</b>, the spaces <b>27</b> between these nanocarbon particles must be sufficiently small, i.e., nanoscale in size and smaller than the molecules of the fluid, so as to facilitate the fluid going through the pores <b>23</b> within the nanoadsorption material <b>21</b> and not through spaces around the pores <b>23</b>. Likewise, should the carbon particles be larger than nanoscale size, such large carbon particles may block, partially block, and/or create interference with the flow of the fluid into the pores <b>23</b>, thus allowing fluid to flow away from the pores <b>23</b>. As a result, particulates and/or contaminants within the fluid flow may escape entrapment within the pores <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be appreciated that since one surface <b>25</b> of the porous matrix <b>20</b> is substantially impermeable to fluid, the porous matrix <b>20</b> of the present invention does not have flow-through properties similar to commercially available filters. Rather, fluid flowing against or across the contact surface <b>24</b> will enter and exit along the contact surface <b>24</b>. Specifically, fluid flowing against or across the contact surface <b>24</b> into the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> cannot thereafter exit through surface <b>25</b>. In the presence of the impermeable surface <b>25</b>, the fluid directed into one opening of a pore <b>23</b> adjacent the impermeable surface <b>25</b> may subsequently be allowed to flow out another opening of pore <b>23</b> not blocked by the impermeable surface <b>25</b>, as illustrated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, and eventually make its way out through the contact surface <b>24</b>. Impermeable surface <b>25</b>, in one embodiment of the present invention, may be generated by applying a layer of a substantially fluid impermeable material to one surface of the porous matrix <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The porous matrix <b>20</b> may further, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, be impregnated with, for instance, silver or silver compound(s) so as to minimize microbial growth within the porous matrix <b>20</b>. In particular, the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may be treated with a silver compound in the presence of acid or alkaline materials, depending on the silver compound used, so that the silver compound can be substantially evenly distributed against internal surfaces of pores <b>23</b>. Since this process can generate undesirable materials during the chemical reactions, such materials can be removed, in one embodiment, by leaching. The process employed herein can enhance the properties of the porous matrix <b>20</b>. In addition to removal of particulates and contaminants, the presence of the silver compound, as noted, can minimize microbial growth within the porous matrix <b>20</b>. Furthermore, it should be noted that the silver content provided within the porous matrix <b>20</b> using the process described herein may be at a level far below the permissible limits of silver in drinking water. In an embodiment, the silver content may be approximately 1 percent by weight. Additionally, the process employed herein can minimize the leaching of the silver content from within the porous matrix <b>20</b>. In this manner, the presence of the silver compound within the porous matrix <b>20</b> does not act to elevate the level of silver above permissible limits.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition to or instead of silver or silver compound, the porous matrix <b>20</b> may include copper, zinc and/or other compounds such as ferric oxide within the pores <b>23</b>, so as to, for instance, aid in the killing of microorganisms and viruses, and aid in the removal of inorganic contaminants.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the container <b>10</b>, in one embodiment, may include, across its upper end <b>31</b>, a lid <b>32</b> to prevent spilling of fluid from within the chamber <b>12</b>. The lid <b>32</b>, in one embodiment, may be a snap-on cover, may be hingedly connected to the container <b>10</b>, or may be any other design, for instance, extruded to be integral with the container <b>10</b>, so long as it can operate to prevent fluid from spilling from within the chamber <b>12</b>. To facilitate removal of treated fluid from within the chamber <b>12</b>, lid <b>32</b> may, in an embodiment, be designed to include an spout <b>33</b> through which fluid can exit. Spout <b>33</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may include a movable cap <b>34</b> to seal spout <b>33</b> and minimize unwanted spilling of fluid from within the chamber <b>12</b> therethrough. In an embodiment, cap <b>34</b> may be hingedly attached to lid <b>32</b>. Cap <b>34</b> may also be a snap on cap. Alternatively, spout <b>33</b> may be designed without a cap <b>34</b>. Similarly, to facilitate addition of fluid to be treated into the compartment <b>11</b>, lid <b>32</b> may be provided with a movable cover <b>35</b> positioned substantially over a location at which the compartment <b>11</b> may be situated within the chamber <b>12</b>. Cover <b>35</b>, in one embodiment, may be hingedly coupled to lid <b>32</b>. Cover <b>35</b> may, in an alternate embodiment, be a snap-on cover, or may be of any design that can facilitate easy access to the compartment <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the system of the present invention may be used to purify fluid by removing particulates and/or contaminants from the fluid, such as water, when the levels of particulates and/or contaminants exceed the prescribed limits for fluid that is intended for human consumption. The limits of contaminants in the drinking fluids may be prescribed, for instance, by governmental regulators. In operation, fluid <b>41</b> that may include particulates and/or contaminants may be initially be introduced into a purification compartment positioned within the chamber of the container <b>42</b>. Once introduced within the compartment, the fluid along with the molecules of contaminants therein, when coming into contact with the porous matrix having the nanostructured adsorption material (e.g., flowing against or across the contact surface of the porous matrix), may be directed into the pores of the nanostructured adsorption material, wherein the molecules of contaminants may be trapped. It should be noted that the movement of fluid within the compartment caused by or due to, for instance, the draining of purified or treated fluid <b>44</b> from the compartment, should be sufficient to direct the flow of contaminants into the pores. If the situation is such that there is little or no movement of fluid within the compartment (e.g., when a plate is situated across the outlet end <b>113</b>), the contaminants may still be removed by slow molecular displacement or diffusion of molecules into the porous matrix within the compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the phenomenon occurs at a molecular level, the particulates and/or contaminants typically cannot be released from the pores within which they are trapped without enormous pressure or the application of heat at elevated levels. As the particulates and/or contaminants enter and become trapped within the pores, the weight of nanostructured adsorption material can increase to a measurable difference. Such an increase can be detected and displayed, for example, by a sensor, to indicate, for instance, the levels of contaminants removed from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Accordingly, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a sensor <b>43</b> may be coupled to the compartment <b>42</b>, such that the sensor <b>43</b> may be in communication with a porous matrix within the receptacle in order to display the levels of contaminants removed from the fluid. Sensor <b>43</b> can be any sensor which can detect a pressure, weight or heat differential between a porous matrix at time t<sub>o </sub>and the same porous matrix at time t<sub>n</sub>, subsequent to exposure of the porous matrix to the fluid. In one embodiment, the sensor <b>43</b> may include pressure detector sufficiently thin (e.g., thin layer wired mesh or sheet), so as to be capable of being embedded within the nanostructured adsorption material of the porous matrix, and a display in communication with the detector. The pressure detector can act to transform the pressure differential between t<sub>o </sub>and t<sub>n </sub>into electrical signals that can subsequently be process and shown on the display as the amount of particulates or contaminants in the porous matrix or the amount of contaminant removed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sensor <b>43</b> may alternatively employ a weight sensor. It is noted that if at t<sub>o </sub>the weight of the porous matrix is x milligram, then at t<sub>n</sub>, for instance, 15 seconds, when the nanostructured material of the porous matrix has had a chance to adsorb the particulates and/or contaminants, the weight of nanostructured adsorption material will be x+y, with y being the weight of contaminants that has been removed from the fluid. The weight increase due to the adsorption of the contaminants can be transformed to electrical signals, which can subsequently be displayed as information on a scale in terms of percentage of contaminants removed from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sensor <b>43</b> may also employ a heat sensor. If, for instance, at t<sub>o </sub>the temperature of the porous matrix is x degrees, then at t<sub>n</sub>, for instance, 15 seconds, when the nanostructured material of the porous matrix has had a chance to adsorb the particulates and/or contaminants, the heat generated in the nanostructured adsorption material will be x+y, with y being the temperature increase due to the adsorption of contaminants in the nanostructured material. This temperature increase can be transformed to electrical signals, which can subsequently be displayed as information on a scale in terms of percentage of contaminants removed from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Whether using the pressure, weight and/or heat detector, when the nanostructured adsorption material approaches about 90% its capacity level for trapping particulates and/or contaminants, the sensor <b>43</b>, in one embodiment, can be designed to warn the user, for instance, by audio, visual, or other applicable indicators, that the porous matrix needs replacing or that the treating compartment can no longer be used, if the treating compartment is designed to be a disposable compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The system of the present invention, accordingly, may be refilled over and over again with fluid to be treated. The system may be used successively to generate purified fluid meeting standards or limits prescribed for human consumption, until the nanostructured adsorption material of the porous matrix approaches its exhaustive capacity for trapping and retaining particles therein, i.e., having entrapped and retained therein particulates and/or contaminants at about 90% of its capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The porous matrix of the present invention may be designed for easy removal from the filtering compartment when the matrix has substantially reached its exhaustive capacity. To that end, looking again at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the porous matrix <b>20</b>, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, may be adhered directly onto walls <b>16</b> of the compartment <b>11</b>. In particular, the porous matrix may be provided as a sheet of material that can be adhered to the walls <b>16</b> of compartment <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the porous matrix may be coated onto walls <b>16</b> as a thin film or layer. Regardless of the adherence mechanism, it should be one that is non-degradable in the presence of fluid. In either embodiment, the thin film or sheet of porous matrix may be designed so that it is sufficiently flexible and pliable for removal or insertion into the compartment <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In accordance with another embodiment, the porous matrix <b>20</b> may be embedded within the compartment walls <b>16</b>, so that contact surface <b>24</b> of the matrix <b>20</b> may be exposed to the fluid within the compartment <b>11</b>, while substantially impermeable surface <b>25</b> may be positioned against chamber walls <b>16</b>. In an embodiment, the porous matrix <b>20</b> may be embedded within the walls substantially circumferentially about the compartment <b>11</b>. The matrix may be designed to extend partially up walls <b>16</b>, should it be desired, or may be permitted to extend substantially along the length of walls <b>16</b>. To embed the porous matrix <b>20</b> within the walls <b>16</b>, means known in the art may be employed, for instance, co-extrusion of the porous matrix <b>20</b> along with the material comprising compartment <b>11</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, porous matrix <b>20</b> may be provided with a thickness ranging from about 0.20 mm to about 0.30 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Looking now at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a porous matrix <b>50</b>, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, and in accordance with this particular embodiment of the present invention, may be provided as a loose mass of macro particles <b>53</b> that can freely move within compartment <b>51</b> of a fluid container. Each of the particles <b>53</b> may include a contact surface <b>531</b> having a plurality of nanoscaled pores <b>532</b> and an impermeable core <b>533</b>, so that fluid may be prevented from flowing through the particles <b>53</b>. The particles <b>53</b>, in one embodiment, may be uniform in size and shape, or as illustrated, vary in size and shape. In an embodiment, the size of the particles <b>53</b> may range from about 0.001 millimeter (mm) to about 10 mm, and may be provided in sufficient amount to substantially fill compartment <b>51</b>. The placement of such an amount within compartment <b>51</b> can create channels <b>54</b> between the particles <b>53</b>, so that fluid within the compartment <b>51</b> may flow through the channels <b>54</b>. It should be appreciated that as the fluid flows along the channels <b>54</b>, the fluid flows pass the contact surface <b>531</b> to permit the pores <b>532</b> in the contact surface <b>531</b> to entrap and retain particulates and/or contaminants within the pores <b>532</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an alternate embodiment, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a porous matrix <b>60</b> made from a nanostructured adsorption material in a shape of a block <b>63</b> may be provided within compartment <b>61</b> of a fluid container. Block <b>63</b>, in one embodiment, may include a plurality of channels <b>64</b> extending substantially from one of its end <b>631</b> to an opposite end <b>632</b>. The number of channels <b>64</b> may vary so as to provide the block <b>63</b> with a porosity ranging from about 10 percent to about 90 percent. The block <b>63</b> may also include a contact surface <b>633</b> provided circumferentially along each channel <b>64</b>, a plurality of nanoscaled pores <b>634</b> extending into the block <b>63</b> and away from the surface <b>633</b>, and an impermeable core <b>635</b> in the area between any two adjacent channels <b>64</b>. In this manner, fluid flowing through a channel <b>64</b> can be prevented from flowing over to an adjacent channel <b>64</b> to permit the pores <b>634</b> along the contact surface <b>633</b> within each channel to entrap and retain particulates and/or contaminants within the pores on the block <b>63</b>. Although illustrated as substantially conforming to the compartment <b>61</b>, the block <b>63</b>, in an embodiment, may be provided with any size or shape, so long as it permits fluid to flow therethrough (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Of course, block <b>63</b> may also not need to conform to the shape of compartment <b>61</b>, so long as it permits fluid to flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In accordance with one embodiment, similar to the porous matrix <b>20</b> above, performance of porous matrix <b>50</b> and/or <b>60</b> may be enhanced by impregnating the pores of the matrix with silver, silver compound(s), copper, zinc and/or other compounds such as ferric oxide, so as to minimize microbial growth, aid in the killing of microorganisms and viruses, and/or aid in the removal of inorganic contaminants. Of course, it is not necessary that the matrix be impregnated with such compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the container <b>10</b> of the present invention may include a handle <b>17</b> for lifting and handling of the container. Handle <b>17</b>, of course, can be of any geometric shape or size to permit handling of the container. The container may further include a lip <b>18</b> at its top end to facilitate pouring of the treated fluid from within the chamber and to minimize any spilling. As the container <b>10</b> needs to accommodate a substantial amount of fluid and withstand a good deal of handling, the container <b>10</b>, in an embodiment, may be made from a strong and rigid material. Examples of a material from which the container <b>10</b> may be made includes plastics, molded plastics, metal, a combination thereof or any other strong and rigid material. To the extent desired, the container <b>10</b> may be made from a transparent material to permit the user to see the amount of remaining treated fluid in the chamber before making a decision whether to add more fluid to be treated into the compartment <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the invention has been described in connection with the specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of further modification. Furthermore, this application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention, including such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains, and as fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
