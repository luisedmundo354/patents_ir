<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a digital signal processing apparatus and a digital signal processing method, and more particularly to a digital signal processing apparatus comprising a plurality of digital signal processing units each having a storage means wherein the digital signal processing units share respective storage means as a shared memory, and the method of controlling the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Up until now, there have been provided a wide variety of digital signal processing apparatuses, one of which comprises a shared memory and is adapted to process data stored in the shared memory. One of the conventional digital signal processing apparatuses of this type is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> as comprising a digital signal processing group <b>5</b>, consisting of a plurality of digital signal processing units, for example, digital signal processing units <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, respectively bearing reference legends “DSP #1”, “DSP #2”, “DSP #3”, and “DSP #4”, a shared memory <b>6</b> for storing data to be processed by the digital signal processing units <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, an address bus <b>7</b> through which the digital signal processing units <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are operative to specify addresses of data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b>, a data bus <b>8</b> through which the digital signal processing units <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are operative to read and write the data with the specified addresses in the shared memory <b>6</b>, and a control bus <b>9</b> through which the digital signal processing units <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are operative to receive control signals wherein the digital signal processing units <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> are operative to process the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> with reference to the control signals so as to prevent two or more digital signal processing units of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b> from requesting the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One digital signal processing unit of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b>, for example, a digital signal processing unit <b>1</b>, is operated to receive a control signal from the control bus <b>9</b>, and to judge whether or not the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> are occupied by the other digital signal processing unit <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b> with reference to the control signal thus received. The digital signal processing unit <b>1</b> can read and write the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> through the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> when it is judged that the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> are not occupied by the other digital signal processing unit <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b>. The digital signal processing unit <b>1</b>, on the other hand, can not read or write the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> through the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> when it is judged that the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> are occupied by the other digital signal processing unit <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b>. The conventional digital signal processing apparatus thus constructed is operative to have only one digital signal processing unit of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b>, i.e., the digital signal processing unit <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b> read and write the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> through the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> at a time, thereby preventing a bus contention from arising when two or more digital signal processing units of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b> request the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The conventional digital signal processing apparatus, in which any one digital signal processing unit of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b> can not read or write the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> through the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> when it is judged that the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> are occupied by the other digital signal processing unit <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b>, however, encounters a drawback that two or more digital signal processing units of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b> can not read or write the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> through the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> when the two or more digital signal processing units of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b> request the data stored in the shared memory <b>6</b> at the same time. This makes it difficult for the conventional digital signal processing apparatus to carry out real-time signal processing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each digital signal processing unit of the digital signal processing group <b>5</b>, i.e., the digital signal processing unit <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b> is required to carry out a signal processing process on acoustic signal data for every one audio sample period defined on the basis of an audio sampling frequency. Some digital signal processing units, however, may fail to carry out signal processing processes in synchronous with the audio sample period while the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b> are occupied by the other digital signal processing unit. Failure to carry out a signal processing process on acoustic signal data within one audio sample period may generate discontinuous acoustic signals, thereby resulting in acoustic noises. The conventional digital signal processing apparatus encounters another drawback that remaining digital signal processing units may not carry out a signal processing process on the acoustic signal data while one digital signal processing unit occupies the address bus <b>7</b> and the data bus <b>8</b>. The present invention contemplates resolution of such problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a digital signal processing apparatus, in which a plurality of digital signal processing units can simultaneously utilize data stored in a shared memory section regardless of bus controls.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The digital signal processing apparatus is required to carry out acoustic signal processing in synchronization with audio sample frames. In general, the audio sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, or 96 kHz is applicable to an audio DSP for digital audio signal processing. An audio sample frame is calculated as the reciprocal of the audio sampling frequency. The audio sampling frequency of, for example, 48 kHz, is applied to the digital signal processing apparatus <b>100</b> for digital audio signal processing, the digital signal processing apparatus <b>100</b> is required to carry out acoustic signal processing in synchronization with every one audio sample frame of, which is calculated as the reciprocal of 48 kHz, i.e., 1/48000 second. Failure to complete an acoustic signal processing process on an acoustic signal in synchronous with one audio sample frame may generate discontinuous acoustic signals, thereby resulting in acoustic noises. This leads to the fact that the digital signal processing apparatus, in general, permits an interrupt to occur in synchronization with an audio sample frame period, and allows every acoustic signal processing process to be carried out and completed in accordance with the interrupt.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the digital signal processing apparatus <b>100</b> starts a sample frame processing process upon an audio sample frame interrupt occurring in step S<b>11</b>. Step S<b>11</b> goes forward to step S<b>20</b> of an input/output thread of inputting and/or outputting acoustic signal data elements from and/or to external device, not shown. Step S<b>20</b> goes forward to step S<b>30</b> of audio thread of carrying out audio signal processing on the signal data elements. Step S<b>30</b> goes forward to step S<b>90</b> of post-processing thread of preparing the data elements to be transmitted. Step S<b>90</b> goes forward to step S<b>99</b> in which the sample frame processing process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Step S<b>20</b> of the input/output thread comprises steps S<b>21</b>, S<b>22</b>, and S<b>23</b>. In step S<b>21</b>, the shared memory data elements <b>50</b> of the preceding sample frame stored in the receiving buffer <b>114</b> are copied to a shared memory section <b>117</b>. Step S<b>21</b> goes forward to step S<b>22</b>, in which the process of copying shared memory data elements <b>50</b> of the preceding sample frame stored in the receiving buffer <b>114</b> to the shared memory section <b>117</b> is completed. Step S<b>22</b> goes forward to step S<b>23</b>, in which the shared memory data elements <b>50</b> stored in the shared memory section <b>117</b> are transmitted to the external device, not shown. Thus, the digital signal processing unit <b>10</b> is operated to output the shared memory data elements <b>50</b> including acoustic signal data already processed and stored therein up to the preceding audio sample frame to the external device in step S<b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Step S<b>30</b> of audio thread comprises steps S<b>31</b>, S<b>41</b>, to S<b>51</b> of performing n units of signal processing processes, viz., acoustic signal processing processes 1, 2, to n. This means that the digital signal processing unit <b>10</b> is operated to input the shared memory data elements <b>50</b> stored in the shared memory section <b>117</b> as an input signal in steps S<b>32</b>, S<b>42</b>, and S<b>52</b>, to process the shared memory data elements <b>50</b> thus inputted and to generate an output signal in steps S<b>33</b>, S<b>43</b>, and S<b>53</b>, and to write the output signal into the shared memory section <b>117</b> as shared memory data elements <b>50</b> in steps S<b>34</b>, S<b>44</b>, and S<b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Step S<b>90</b> of post-processing thread comprises step S<b>91</b>, in which shared memory data elements <b>50</b> stored in the shared memory section <b>117</b> is stored into a transmitting buffer <b>119</b>. The shared memory data elements <b>50</b> thus stored in the transmitting buffer <b>119</b> will be transmitted to the subsequent digital signal processing unit <b>20</b>.
