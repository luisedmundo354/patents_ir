<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of N<sup>6</sup>-substituted aminopurine ribofuranose nucleosides. More particularly, the invention is concerned with an improved process for preparing N<sup>6</sup>-substituted aminopurine ribofuranose nucleosides by amination of the corresponding 6-halopurine ribofuranose nucleoside in the presence of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Compounds of this type are known to be useful in the preparation of compounds having activity at adenosine receptors, e.g. the Adenosine A1 receptor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Adenosine A1 agonists and processes for their preparation are described in: EP0322242, WO97/43300, WO99/24449, WO99/24450, WO99/24452, WO99/67262, WO98/16539 (Novo Nordisk A/S); WO98/04126 (Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals Inc.); and WO98/01459 (Novo Nordisk A/S). For example, in WO99/67262 (Glaxo Group Limited), adenosine derivatives are prepared by reaction of a halopurine ribofuranose nucleoside with an amine either in the absence or presence of a solvent such as an alcohol, an ether, a substituted amide, a halogenated hydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or acetonitrile, preferably at an elevated temperature, in the presence of a suitable acid scavenger, for example, inorganic bases such as sodium, cesium or potassium carbonate, or organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, optionally in the presence of a palladium catalyst and phosphine ligand.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An alternative process for the preparation of arylamines is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,460 (Buchwald). This process involves reacting an amine with an aryl halide compound in the presence of a nickel or palladium catalyst. The present inventors found, however, that when reacting 6-halopurine ribofuranose nucleosides with certain amines (e.g. 4-chloro-2-fluoroaniline), the process had low reproducibility and tended to give incomplete reaction and very low yield. The incomplete reaction, in addition to the necessity of removing the palladium heavy metal makes the process impractical for preparing certain 6-substituted aminopurine ribofuranose nucleosides.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">CaCO<sub>3 </sub>processes for preparing adenosine derivatives are described in Kwatra et al., (1987) <i>J. Med. Chem</i>. 30:954, Fleysher et al., (1969) <i>J. Med. Chem</i>. 12:1056 and Yadava et al. (1988) <i>Himalayan Chem. Pharm Bull</i>. 5:31. For example, Fleysher et al. describes the synthesis of N<sup>6</sup>-phenyladenosine from 6-chloropurine riboside in absolute ethanol in the presence of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. However, the present inventors found that when anilines of poor nucleophilicity like 4-cholor-2-fluoroaniline were reacted with 6-chloropurine riboside under these conditions, the reaction was slow and a significant amount of N<sup>6</sup>-aryladenine by-product was derived from cleavage of the glycosyl linkage. The reaction was also found to be sensitive to the choice of solvents, for example, it had no meaningful conversion in 2-methoxyethanol and provided only 25% yield of product in isopropanol.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The problem to be solved by the present invention was therefore to provide an improved process for the preparation of N<sup>6</sup>-substituted aminopurine ribofuranose nucleosides.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors have surprisingly found that when a CaCO<sub>3 </sub>process is used for preparing N<sup>6</sup>-substituted aminopurine ribofuranose nucleosides, the addition of acid at the start of the reaction accelerates the reaction, improves the yield, and/or reduces the quantity of acid hydrolysis by-products generated. It is surprising that the addition of acid improves the efficiency of the reaction instead of neutralising the base (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and preventing the reaction. Previously, CaCO<sub>3 </sub>had been used as an acid scavenger (base) to promote reactions in which an acid was generated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing N<sup>6</sup>-substituted aminopurine ribofuranose nucleosides comprising the step of reacting a 6-halopurine ribofuranose nucleoside (e.g. a 6-chloropurine ribofuranose nucleoside) with an amine (e.g. an aliphatic amine, alicyclic amine or aromatic amine) in the presence of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, characterised in that acid is added to the reaction mixture at the start of the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further aspect of the invention is the use of the process of the invention in the preparation of compounds which have activity at adenosine receptors, e.g. the Adenosine A1 receptor.</p>

After 1.5 h, the control reaction (no CaCO<sub>3</sub>, no HCl) had only 5% product, HCl reaction 71%, CaCO<sub>3</sub>/HCl reaction 69% and CaCO<sub>3 </sub>reaction 17%. These numbers demonstrate that addition of HCl to the reaction mixture increased reaction rate. CaCO<sub>3 </sub>appeared to reduce the level of impurities (compare impurity level for reactions B and C, 10% vs. 4.5% at the 1.5<sup>th </sup>h and 27% vs. 7.7% at the 3<sup>rd </sup>h). For results at the 3 h, the last reaction (D) is not a direct comparison due to the fact the numbers in ** were taken at the 5<sup>th </sup>hour.</p>
