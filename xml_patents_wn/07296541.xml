<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to animal restraining and identification systems. In particular, the present invention relates to an animal safety collar and methods of operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Animal collars are used to restrain and identify domesticated animals. For example, dog collars generally include a tag with identification and vaccination information as well as a loop for attaching a leash. A leash is commonly attached to a collar when an animal is removed from a confined area. For example, when an owner takes their domesticated dog for a walk they generally attach a collar to prevent the dog from exhibiting bad behavior and/or escaping. Collars are positioned around an animals' neck between their shoulders and their head. The neck is utilized for collar placement because of its relatively narrow diameter with respect to the shoulders and head. Various attachment systems are used to secure the collar around an animal's neck such as clasps, buckles, etc. Likewise, collars are made of various materials including leather, nylon, plastic, metal, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional collars are composed of one or more static materials that are configured for one or more static diameters to accommodate the particular neck diameter of an animal. The static or fixed diameter property of a collar is necessary to prevent an animal from sliding out of the collar when it is attached to a leash or when it is restrained. For example, if a dog commonly pulls away from the owner during a walk, it is necessary for the collar to be rigid to prevent the dog from slipping out of the collar. A collar may also be used to constrain an animal to a particular fixed location via a long leash, cord, or rope. In this scenario, it is also necessary to prevent the animal from sliding out of the collar when it pulls against the leash, cord, or rope.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the fixed or static collar property also poses significant safety risks for an animal when it is not coupled to a leash or other containment system. It is possible for the collar to become hooked or entangled in an object. Since the collar is positioned around an animals' neck, the entanglement or hooking of the collar may compress the larynx of the animal, causing asphyxiation. Alternatively, the entanglement may cause extreme discomfort to the animal for an extended period of time. In addition, the static diameter properties of a collar may injure or hurt a second animal that inadvertently becomes entangled in the first animal's collar. For example, dogs often physically play or fight with one another by biting at neck region of one another. If during this activity, one of the dogs becomes entangled in the others collar, they are likely to pull away from one another possibly causing damage or discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need in the industry for an animal collar that overcomes the problems above while maintaining the features of conventional collars.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to an animal safety collar and methods of operation. One embodiment of the present invention relates to an animal safety collar including a strip of flexible material, an extendable material, a first coupling device, and a second coupling device. The extendable material is coupled to either end of the strip of flexible material so as to form a loop. The loop's circumference may be temporarily increased by expanding the extendable material, causing the ends of the flexible material to move away from one another. This capability allows the collar to expand so the animal can slide out of the collar when it is inadvertently coupled to a fixed object in an unsupervised scenario. The first and second coupling devices are fixably coupled to the ends of the strip of flexible material, respectively. Therefore, when the extendable material is expanded, the first and second coupling device move away from one another. The expanding capability may be disabled by rigidly coupling a device simultaneously to the first and second couplers, thereby preventing them from moving away from one another. Therefore, the expandable safety feature may be disabled when an animal is in a supervised scenario such as a walk.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention relates to an animal safety collar and methods of operation. One embodiment of the present invention relates to an animal safety collar including a strip of flexible material, an extendable material, a first coupling device, and a second coupling device. The extendable material is coupled to either end of the strip of flexible material so as to form a loop. The loop's circumference may be temporarily increased by expanding the extendable material, causing the ends of the flexible material to move away from one another. This capability allows the collar to expand so the animal can slide out of the collar when it is inadvertently coupled to a fixed object in an unsupervised scenario. The first and second coupling devices are fixably coupled to the ends of the strip of flexible material, respectively. Therefore, when the extendable material is expanded, the first and second coupling device move away from one another. The expanding capability may be disabled by rigidly coupling a device simultaneously to the first and second couplers, thereby preventing them from moving away from one another. Therefore, the expandable safety feature may be disabled when an animal is in a supervised scenario such as a walk. Also, while embodiments of the present invention are directed at an animal safety collar and methods of operation, it will be appreciated that the teachings of the present invention are applicable to other areas.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following terms are defined as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Strip of flexible material—an elongated portion of material in which the length is longer than the height and that is composed of a material that may be curved and/or flexed in at least one orientation. A strip of flexible material may include but not be limited to a piece of nylon, leather, rope, string, plastic, metal, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Internally coupled—a coupling between a first and second object in which the first object is coupled to an internal region of the second object so as to hide the coupled portion of the first object.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference is initially made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, which illustrate perspective views of a safety collar in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the collar is illustrated in a compressed and expanded configuration respectively, and designated generally at <b>100</b>. The collar <b>100</b> includes a strip of flexible material <b>105</b>, an extendable material <b>110</b>, a first coupling device <b>115</b>, and a second coupling device <b>120</b>. The illustrated strip of flexible material <b>105</b> includes a nylon material with a specific durable stitching pattern. The strip of flexible material <b>105</b> may be bent or flexed so as to change the shape, but it cannot be substantially stretched. Therefore, the strip of flexible material <b>105</b> may bend to adjust to an oval or non-linear shape rather than a circle. Various other materials and dimensions may be used and yet remain consistent with the present invention. The strip of flexible material <b>105</b> may further include an information/identification system such as a tag. The illustrated strip of flexible material <b>105</b> is internally coupled to the extendable material <b>110</b>, the first coupling device <b>115</b>, and the second coupling device <b>120</b>. This internal coupling includes disposing a portion of the extendable material <b>110</b>, first coupling device <b>115</b>, and second coupling device <b>120</b> within an internal hollow region of the strip of flexible material <b>105</b>. The illustrated strip of flexible material includes an internal lengthwise cavity. The internal coupling includes a stitch <b>125</b> that extends through the strip of flexible material, the extendable material <b>110</b>, the first coupling device <b>115</b>, and the second coupling device <b>120</b>. Various other stitching patterns or internal coupling systems may also be practiced in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The extendable material <b>110</b> is disposed between the ends of the strip of flexible material <b>105</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The extendable material <b>110</b> is configured to be both flexible and expandable. Therefore, the extendable material <b>110</b> may bend to change shape and expand to change length. In addition, the extendable material <b>110</b> is biased to a particular default length that substantially positions the first and second coupling device <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> adjacent to one another as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, the extendable material <b>110</b> may be expanded in response to an expansion force <b>150</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the extendable material <b>110</b> is expanded, the ends of the strip of flexible material <b>105</b> and the coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> are separated away from one another. Various other forces may be translated into an expansion force to expand the extendable material <b>110</b>, as discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the collar <b>100</b> in a compressed configuration, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the collar <b>100</b> in an expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The illustrated first and second coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> are positioned on the ends of the strip of flexible material and configured to extend in a substantially perpendicular orientation. The first and second coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> are composed of a substantially rigid material such as plastic or a plastic composite. The coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> are shaped to receive an external coupling device that extends through both coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> so as to disable or override the expansion capability of the extendable material <b>110</b>. Since the coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> are composed of a substantially rigid material and are coupled to the ends of the strip of flexible material <b>105</b>, a rigid external coupler that couples to both the first and second coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> will prevent or impede the coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> from separating away from one another, thereby disabling the expansion capability. The disabling of the expansion feature will be discussed in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference is next made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-C</figref>, which illustrates a sequence of operation in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, in which the collar expands to allow the animal to escape in an unsupervised scenario. A collar <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention is disposed on a dog <b>205</b>. The dog <b>205</b> is shown inadvertently coupled via the collar to a tree branch <b>210</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Because of the positioning of the collar <b>100</b> on the dog's neck, there is a risk of harm or trauma if the dog <b>205</b> remains coupled to the tree branch <b>210</b>. The dog's <b>205</b> natural instinct is to pull away from the tree branch <b>210</b>, as represented by force arrow <b>220</b>. By exerting an outward force <b>220</b> away from the fixed tree branch <b>210</b>, an expansion force is exerted upon the collar <b>100</b>, thereby causing the extendable material to expand apart. By expanding the extendable material, the overall loop length of the collar <b>100</b> is expanded. The expanded loop length and dimension of the collar <b>100</b> is sufficient to allow the dog <b>205</b> to safely pull out of the collar <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. It should be noted that the pulling out of the collar <b>100</b> is a natural reaction of the dog <b>205</b> and does not require training. The dog <b>205</b> has then released itself from the collar <b>100</b> and avoided harm and trauma. Various other inadvertent coupling scenarios may also be overcome with a similar process. Likewise, other animals will execute a similar process to release themselves from a collar under similar circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reference is next made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which illustrates a method of operation in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention, in which the expandable features of a collar are disabled to constrain the animal in a supervised scenario, designated generally at <b>300</b>. A collar <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention is positioned on a dog's <b>350</b> neck. An external rigid coupler <b>320</b> is routed through both the first and second coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b>. The illustrated external rigid coupler <b>320</b> is a leash which further includes a clasp <b>310</b> and a strap <b>305</b>. The clasp <b>310</b> rigidly extends through both the first and second coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> effectively restricting the coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> from substantially moving away from one another. Since the coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> are prevented from moving away from one another and are rigidly coupled to the ends of the strip of flexible material <b>105</b>, the collar <b>100</b> is thus prevented from expanding. For example, if the dog <b>350</b> pulls away from the clasp <b>310</b> in any direction, the collar <b>100</b> will not expand because the first and second coupling devices <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> are prevented from moving away from one another. Therefore, a user can disable the expansion capability of the collar in a supervised scenario such as a walk so as to prevent the dog <b>350</b> from slipping out of the collar <b>100</b>. The external coupling device <b>320</b> may later be removed in an unsupervised scenario to protect the dog <b>350</b> from harm or trauma due to inadvertently coupling the collar <b>100</b> to a fixed object, as previously discussed above with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-C</figref>.</p>
