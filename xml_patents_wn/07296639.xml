<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority on European Patent Application 03250242.9 filed 15 Jan. 2003; European Patent Application 03250243.7 filed 15 Jan. 2003 and European Patent Application 03076196.9 filed 24 Apr. 2003.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a wellstring assembly for use in a well extending downwardly from the earth's surface. In a particular aspect the invention relates to a well-drilling bit assembly suitable for performing a through-bit operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The expression wellstring is used to refer to any string or well tubular used for operations in a borehole, such as drilling, logging, fluid transportation. The well string does not necessarily need to be tubular over its entire length. The well string can in particular be a drill string, and can include a well-drilling bit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">International patent application with publication No. WO 00/17488 discloses a system for drilling and logging of a wellbore formed in an earth formation, wherein a logging tool can be lowered in the wellbore from inside a drill string through a well drilling bit at the lower end of the drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The known system comprises a well-drilling bit including a bit body provided with a passageway for the logging tool, and a closure element for the passageway in the form of an insert section at the bit face. The bit body is attachable to a tubular drill string at a drill-string side of the bit body, and the passageway extends from an opening at the drill-string side to the well exterior of the bit body. The closure element comprises a bit-connecting means in the form of a primary latching device for selectively connecting the closure element to the bit body, so as to selectively close the passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The known system further comprises an auxiliary tool for manipulating the closure element, which auxiliary tool forms the downstream part of a logging tool string.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the specification and in the claims the terms upstream, upper and downstream, lower are used in relation to the lowering of a tool into a borehole, so that upstream, upper is closer to the surface than downstream, lower.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The logging tool string of the known system is arranged so that it can pass from the attached drill string through the opening of the bit body at the drill-string side, along the passageway so that it can reach the closure element, when the closure element is connected to the bit body. The auxiliary tool comprises a tool-connecting means in the form of a secondary latching device for selectively connecting the auxiliary tool to the closure element. The secondary latching device is further so arranged that simultaneously with the latching of the auxiliary tool to the closure element, the primary latching mechanism is operated so that the closure element is unlatched from the bit body while remaining attached to the auxiliary tool.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The well drilling bit of the known system can be used for drilling operation, when the closure element is connected to the bit body. When it is desired to log the formation, drilling operation is stopped, and the logging tool string with the auxiliary tool at its lower end is lowered through the drill string into the passageway. The tool-connecting means (secondary latching mechanism) is connected to the closure element, and, simultaneously, the bit-connecting means (primary latching mechanism) is operated so as to release the closure element from the bit body. Then, the logging tool can be lowered into the wellbore ahead of the well drilling bit from where logging can be performed. After logging has been completed, the logging tool string can be pulled back into the drill string, so that the closure element is re-connected to the bit body and the auxiliary tool is simultaneously disconnected from the closure element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The known system has the disadvantage of limited robustness. Fail-safe operation of downhole equipment is generally very important in well drilling operations. With the known system there is for example a risk that the closure element is not sufficiently connected to the bit body in a situation wherein the auxiliary tool is not fully connected to the closure element. This can happen during removal of the closure element, and also when it is attempted to re-insert the closure element after logging was completed. Consequently, the closure element could be lost in the wellbore. The latching mechanism disclosed in International Patent Application publication No. WO 03/004825, which was unpublished at the priority date of the present application, has the same disadvantage. U.S. Pat. No. 3,554,304 discloses a well-drilling bit with cutter elements that are lowered on a conventional wireline with overshot through the drill pipe and locked to the lower end of the drill pipe by a latching mechanism. The wireline can be pulled back to surface and lowered again to reconnect to the cutter element. For removing the cutter elements to surface, the latching mechanism is released by simply pulling the wireline.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide a wellstring assembly that allows access to the well outside of the wellstring via a latching mechanism, and which allows robust and fail-safe operation. It is a particular object to provide a well-drilling bit assembly suitable for through-bit operation, which allows robust and fail-safe operation of the connections between the closure element and the bit body and between the closure element and the auxiliary tool.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To this end in accordance with the present invention there is provided a wellstring assembly comprising a wellstring element, which includes</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a tubular first wellstring part having upper and lower ends between which ends a passageway is arranged;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a second wellstring part co-operating with the lower end of the first wellstring part; and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">a releasable wellstring-interconnecting means for selectively interconnecting the first and second wellstring parts;</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">the wellstring assembly further comprising an auxiliary tool for manipulating the second wellstring part, which auxiliary tool is arranged so that it can pass along the passageway in the first wellstring part to the second wellstring part, when the first and second wellstring parts are interconnected, wherein the auxiliary tool comprises a tool-connecting means for selectively connecting the auxiliary tool to the second wellstring part, and an operating means for operating the wellstring-interconnecting means,</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">wherein the auxiliary tool comprises a first member which includes the tool-connecting means and a second member which includes the operating means, which second member is arranged movably so that it can assume a first and a second position relative to the first member, wherein in the first position the tool-connecting means is connectable, at least when the first and second wellstring parts are interconnected, to the second wellstring part without operating the wellstring-interconnecting means, and wherein after connecting the auxiliary tool to the second wellstring part the wellstring-interconnecting means can be operated by moving the second member including the operating means between the first and the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention starts from the insight that the auxiliary tool has to perform two functions. First, the auxiliary tool needs to be connected to the second (lower) wellstring part. Secondly, the wellstring-interconnecting means (e.g. a bit connecting means which connects the closure element to the bit body) needs to be operated so as to disconnect the wellstring parts from each other. It was further realized that the robustness of the manipulation of the second wellstring part (e.g. the closure element) using the auxiliary tool can be increased, if the two functions of the auxiliary tool are decoupled from each other in a specific way, so that the wellstring-interconnecting means can only be operated when the auxiliary tool is connected to the second wellstring part. In this way it is prevented that the second wellstring part can be lost in the wellbore, since it can only be disconnected from the upper first wellstring part if it is fully connected to the auxiliary tool. When the opening up of the weUstring is reversed, after an operation in the open wellbore has been performed, the auxiliary tool can only be removed when the wellstring parts are properly interconnected again.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention achieves the decoupling of functions in that the auxiliary tool comprises first and second members, each of which is associated with mainly one of the functions, and which are movable relative to each other. In a first relative position between first and second members the auxiliary tool can be connected to the second wellstring part, and by moving the first and second members into their second relative position, the wellstring-interconnecting means is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a particular embodiment the wellstring assembly of the invention is a well-drilling bit assembly suitable for through-bit operation, wherein the wellstring element is a well-drilling bit, wherein the first wellstring part is a bit body attachable at its upper end to a tubular drill string, and wherein the passageway extends between an opening at the upper end and the exterior of the bit body; wherein the second wellstring part is a closure element for the passageway; and wherein the wellstring interconnection means is a bit-connecting means for releasably connecting the closure element to the bit body so as to selectively close the passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another particular embodiment the first wellstring part comprises a tubular wellstring having upper and lower ends, and the second wellstring part comprises a wellstring having upper and lower ends, which upper end is arranged to co-operate with the auxiliary tool and with the lower end of the first wellstring part, and which lower end is attachable to a well-drilling bit. In this embodiment the first and second wellstring parts form a wellstring which can be telescopically opened and closed above the well-drilling bit.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an advantageous embodiment of the auxiliary tool, the tool-connecting means is arranged near the downstream end of the first member, the operating means is arranged near the downstream end of the second member, and the second member is arranged longitudinally slideably along the passageway with respect to the first member. Suitably then in the first relative position the second member is in an upstream position with respect to the first member, and the second member is moved in downstream direction when moving it towards the second relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This embodiment is advantageous because it allows simple operation of the wellstring-interconnecting means by longitudinal motions alone. By lowering the auxiliary tool with the second member in the first relative position, the auxiliary tool can connect to the second wellstring part. With a further longitudinal motion of the second member with respect to the first member, the wellstring-interconnecting means can be operated. Such a longitudinal motion can easily be induced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Suitably the passageway upstream of the second wellstring part and/or the auxiliary tool are provided with an orienting device for angularly orienting the auxiliary tool, so that a fail safe operation can be further ensured by bringing auxiliary tool and second wellstring part in a predetermined angular orientation with respect to each other at the moment of connecting (on order to open the passageway) and also in a predetermined angular position for closing the passageway again. The term angular orienting is used in relation to a rotation about the longitudinal axis of the wellstring, and the angle is in the transverse plane. Suitably, to this end, the auxiliary tool at its outer wall is provided with an outwardly projecting key, and the inner wall of the passageway is provided with two guiding rims forming a central guiding groove through which the key can pass, the guiding groove having upstream and downstream ends, further with an upstream camming rim extending from a position upstream of the guiding groove to the upstream end of the guiding groove fully around the inner wall, and with a downstream camming rim extending from a position downstream of the guiding groove to the downstream end of the guiding groove fully around the inner wall, wherein the camming rims and the guiding rims project sufficiently into the passageway so as to engage, when the auxiliary tool is moved through the passageway, the key and to guide the key into the guiding groove, thereby angularly orienting the auxiliary tool. Alternatively, the camming rims and guiding groove can also be provided on the circumference of the auxiliary tool, and a key on the inner surface of the passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The tool-connecting means of the auxiliary tool and the co-operating part of the closure element are further suitably shaped such that only in the correct predetermined relative angular position between them, as determined by the orienting device, connecting/disconnecting of the auxiliary tool to/from the second wellstring part, and further operation of the wellstring-interconnecting means is possible.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A first embodiment of the invention will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. In this embodiment the wellstring assembly is a well-drilling bit assembly suitable for through-bit operation, the wellstring element is a well-drilling bit, the first wellstring part is a bit body provided with a passageway, the second wellstring part is a closure element for the passageway; and the wellstring interconnection means is a bit-connecting means for releasably connecting the closure element to the bit body so as to selectively close the passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, showing a longitudinal cross-section of a well drilling bit <b>1</b> for through-bit operation, which bit is suitable for use with the present invention. The well drilling bit <b>1</b> is shown in the borehole <b>2</b>, and is attached to the lower end of a drill string <b>3</b>. The well drilling bit <b>1</b> comprises a bit body <b>6</b> including a bit shank <b>7</b> which together form a central longitudinal passageway <b>8</b> for a tool, between the interior <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the drill string <b>3</b> and the borehole <b>2</b> exterior of the well drilling bit <b>1</b>, as will be pointed out in more detail below. Bit nozzles are arranged in the bit body <b>6</b>. Only one nozzle <b>9</b> is shown for the sake of clarity. The nozzle <b>9</b> is connected to the passageway <b>8</b> via the nozzle channel <b>9</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The well drilling bit <b>1</b> is further provided with a removable closure element <b>10</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in its closing position with respect to the passageway <b>8</b>. The closure element <b>10</b> of this example includes a central insert section <b>12</b> and a latching section <b>14</b>. The insert section <b>12</b> is provided with cutting elements <b>16</b> at its front end, wherein the cutting elements are arranged so as to form, in the closing position, a joint bit face together with the cutters <b>18</b> at the front end of the bit body <b>6</b>. The cutting elements <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> can be polycrystalline diamond cutters. The insert section is also provided with nozzles <b>19</b>. Further, the insert section and the cooperating surface of the bit body <b>6</b> are shaped suitably so as to allow transmission of drilling torque from the drill string <b>3</b> and bit body <b>6</b> to the insert section <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The latching section <b>14</b>, which is fixedly attached to the rear end of the insert section <b>12</b>, has substantially cylindrical shape and extends into a central longitudinal bore <b>20</b> in the bit body <b>6</b> with narrow clearance. The bore <b>20</b> forms part of the passageway <b>8</b>, it also provides fluid communication to nozzles in the insert section <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Via the latching section <b>14</b> the closure element <b>10</b> is removably attached to the bit body <b>6</b>. The latching section <b>14</b> of the closure element <b>10</b> comprises a substantially cylindrical outer sleeve <b>23</b> which extends with narrow clearance along the bore <b>20</b>. A sealing ring <b>24</b> is arranged in a groove around the circumference of the outer sleeve <b>23</b>, to prevent fluid communication along the outer surface of the latching section <b>14</b>. Connected to the lower end of the sleeve <b>23</b> is the insert section <b>12</b>. The latching section <b>14</b> further comprises an inner sleeve <b>25</b>, which slidingly fits into the outer sleeve <b>23</b>. The inner sleeve <b>25</b> is provided with an annular rim <b>26</b>, which is biased in upstream direction against an inward shoulder <b>28</b> of the outer sleeve <b>23</b>. The biasing force is exerted by a partly compressed helical spring <b>30</b>, which pushes the inner sleeve <b>25</b> away from the insert section <b>12</b>. At its lower end the inner sleeve <b>25</b> is provided with an annular recess <b>32</b> which is arranged to embrace the upper part of spring <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The outer sleeve <b>23</b> is provided with recesses <b>34</b> wherein locking balls <b>35</b> are arranged. A locking ball <b>35</b> has a larger diameter than the thickness of the wall of the sleeve <b>23</b>, and each recess <b>34</b> is arranged to hold the respective ball <b>35</b> loosely so that it can move a limited distance radially in and out of the sleeve <b>23</b>. Two locking balls <b>35</b> are shown in the drawing, however it will be clear that more locking balls can be arranged. As an alternative for locking balls, locking dogs can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the closing position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the locking balls <b>35</b> are pushed radially outwardly by the inner sleeve <b>25</b>, and register with the annular recess <b>36</b> arranged in the bit body <b>6</b> around the bore <b>20</b>. In this way the closure element <b>10</b> is locked to the well drilling bit <b>1</b>, and the locking balls <b>35</b> together with the groove <b>36</b> form part of a bit-connecting means for connecting the closure element <b>10</b> to the bit body <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The inner sleeve <b>25</b> is further provided with an annular recess <b>37</b>, which is, in the closing position, longitudinally displaced with respect to the recess <b>36</b> in the direction of the drill string <b>3</b>, i.e. in upstream direction. There can also be provided inner recesses <b>38</b>. As will be explained in more detail below, the bit-connecting means can be operated by inducing a longitudinal motion of the inner sleeve <b>25</b> with respect to the outer sleeve <b>23</b>, because in this way the locking balls <b>36</b> can be locked into and released from the groove <b>36</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The latching section <b>14</b> further comprises a two-way orienting device <b>40</b> and a spring-biased activation button <b>45</b>, which are both arranged to co-operate with an auxiliary tool which can be deployed through the interior of the drill string for manipulating the closure element <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The auxiliary tool <b>50</b> for manipulating the closure element <b>10</b> is arranged so that it can pass from surface through the interior of the drill string <b>3</b>, along the passageway to the closure element <b>10</b>, when the closure element is connected to the bit body <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. To this end the auxiliary tool is elongated and substantially cylindrical having a maximum outer diameter of less than the inner diameter of the drill string <b>3</b>. The most downstream part of the auxiliary tool which has to pass into and possibly through the drill bit has a maximum outer diameter of less than the minimum diameter of the passageway. A typical minimum diameter of the passageway is 6 cm (2.5 inch), when the drilling bit <b>1</b> has a diameter of as low as 15 cm (6 inch), or 21 cm (8.5 inch), or 31 cm (12.25 inch).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The auxiliary tool comprises a first, outer member <b>55</b> and a second member in the form of inner piston <b>56</b>. The outer member <b>55</b> of this example has a housing formed by parts <b>57</b>,<b>58</b>,<b>59</b>, which are assembled by screws <b>60</b>,<b>61</b>. The outer member <b>55</b> includes a tool-connecting means at its most downstream end. The tool-connecting means includes four latching petals <b>63</b>, which are arranged to co-operate with the latching recesses <b>39</b> in the latching section <b>14</b> of the closure element <b>10</b>, so as to selectively and releasably connect the auxiliary tool to the closure element.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The inner piston <b>56</b> is provided with an operating means at its downstream end, in the form of a plunger <b>64</b>. The plunger <b>64</b> has a cross-shaped cross-section at its most downstream end, as is best visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and serves to longitudinally shift the inner sleeve <b>25</b> with respect to the outer sleeve <b>23</b> of the latching section. To this end the inner piston <b>56</b> is longitudinally movable with respect to the outer member <b>55</b>. The plunger <b>64</b> is shown at <b>66</b> in a first, retracted position. This position at the same time characterizes the relative position between the first, outer member <b>56</b> and the inner piston (second member) <b>56</b>. This is also visible from the upstream part of the auxiliary tool <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein the shaft <b>67</b> that is connected to the upper part of the inner piston <b>56</b> is fully retracted from the upper part of the outer member <b>55</b>. The shaft <b>67</b> has a shoulder <b>68</b>, and is connected via a swivel <b>69</b> to other equipment (not shown) such as tubing or a logging tool. The swivel allows rotation of such other equipment with respect to the auxiliary tool.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With the plunger in this retracted position, the latching petals <b>63</b> of the outer member <b>55</b> have transverse flexibility towards the axis <b>70</b> of the auxiliary tool, so that they can enter into the latching section <b>14</b> and connect into the latching recesses <b>39</b>. The inner piston <b>56</b> can also be longitudinally moved to assume other positions relative to the outer member <b>55</b>. One such position is indicated dashed at <b>71</b>, and in this position the petals <b>63</b> cannot flex anymore towards the axis.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The plunger <b>64</b> is arranged so that it can push onto the upper end of the inner sleeve, thereby forming an operating means for the bit-connecting means as discussed before.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">This will be discussed in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The auxiliary tool is further provided with several parts that even further support fail-safe operation: Upstream trigger <b>72</b> forming a first retaining device and downstream trigger <b>73</b> forming a second retaining device are arranged on the outer member <b>55</b> to co-operate with a recess <b>75</b> on the inner piston <b>56</b> and with the button <b>45</b> of the bit body <b>6</b>, as will be explained in more detail below. The triggers <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> are provided with notches <b>77</b>, <b>78</b> extending through an opening <b>80</b> in the housing <b>58</b>, and are pivotably mounted about axes <b>82</b>,<b>83</b>, wherein the ends opposite the notches are biased in the direction of the inner piston <b>56</b> by means of a spring <b>86</b>,<b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The housing is further provided with a key <b>90</b> projecting out of the substantially cylindrical outer surface of the downstream part of the outer member <b>55</b>, co-operating with the two-way orienting tool <b>40</b> of the bit body <b>6</b>. The key <b>90</b> is elongated, parallel to the direction of the axis <b>70</b>, and has tapered edges giving it a boat-like shape. The key is supported by springs <b>92</b>. Instead of a boat-shaped elongated key also two separate keys that are longitudinally spaced apart can be arranged. Downstream of the key <b>90</b> and slightly angularly displaced there is an anti-collision button in the form of a radially outwardly extending tip <b>95</b> supported by a spring <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The inner piston <b>56</b> can further be provided with fingers (not shown for the sake of clarity) extending more downstream than the plunger <b>64</b>, which fingers can co-operate with recesses <b>38</b> in the closure element <b>10</b>. In this way, also the inner piston can be connected to the insert section in a predetermined position, which can further contribute to fail-safe operation in the event of strong longitudinally outward forces on the insert section <b>12</b> due to pulling or pumping.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The function of the parts to ensure fail-safe operation will become clear from the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5-7</figref> showing several stages of the interaction between the auxiliary tool and the well drilling bit and interconnection means <b>18</b>. Reference numerals correspond to those already used in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The well drilling bit <b>1</b> with the closure element <b>10</b> in the closing position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be used for progressing the wellbore <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The well drilling bit <b>1</b> with the closure element <b>10</b> in the closing position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has the shape and full functionality of a conventional PDC well drilling bit and can thus be used for normal drilling operation in the same way as well known in the art, e.g. by rotating the drill string <b>3</b> and putting weight on the bit.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When it is desired to open the passageway <b>8</b> by removing the closure element <b>10</b> from its closing position, the well drilling bit is first positioned a distance above the bottom of the borehole. Then, the closure element <b>10</b> can be outwardly removed from the closing position in the well drilling bit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To this end, the auxiliary tool <b>50</b> is lowered from surface or from a position inside the drill string <b>3</b> along the passageway <b>8</b> from the drill string through the opening of the drill string side of the bit body into the bit body <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When lowering the auxiliary tool <b>50</b>, the inner piston <b>56</b> is in its retracted position <b>66</b>, which is also referred to as the first position relative to the outer member <b>56</b> in the specification and in the claims. When the lower part of the auxiliary tool enters the bit body <b>6</b>, the key <b>90</b> engages the upstream camming rim <b>43</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> for the sake of clarity) and the auxiliary tool is turned about the swivel <b>69</b> so that a predetermined angular position between the tool-connecting means and the latching section <b>14</b> is achieved just before the point where the auxiliary tool contacts the latching section <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The petals <b>63</b>, forming the tool-connecting means on the downstream end of the outer member <b>56</b>, are received and guided by the funnel-shaped upstream end <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the outer sleeve <b>23</b> into the latching section <b>14</b>. The legs of the petals <b>63</b> are inwardly deformed until the petals <b>63</b> register with the recesses <b>39</b> so that they can snap outwardly. This position, wherein the auxiliary tool <b>50</b> is connected to the closure element <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is also clear from the drawing that the button <b>45</b> has engaged the notch <b>77</b> of the upstream trigger <b>72</b> (which forms a first retainer device), thereby lifting the upstream end of the trigger <b>72</b> out of the recess <b>75</b>. Therefore, when the petals <b>63</b> have connected into the recesses <b>39</b>, the first retainer device <b>72</b> is operated (released) so that it does not block anymore downstream motion of the inner piston <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further pushing on the upstream end of the auxiliary tool <b>50</b> will cause the inner piston <b>56</b> to slide longitudinally relative to the outer member <b>55</b>. The plunger <b>64</b> engages the upstream end of the inner sleeve <b>25</b>, which has a smaller inner diameter than the diameter of the plunger <b>64</b>. Further downstream motion of the inner piston causes the inner sleeve to be pushed against the force of the spring <b>30</b>, until the locking balls <b>35</b> register with the recesses <b>37</b>. This situation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The locking balls are therefore allowed to move inwardly, thereby unlocking the closure element from annular recess <b>36</b>, i.e. from the bit body. In this way the plunger <b>64</b> forms an operating means for the bit-connecting means. The relative position between the inner piston <b>56</b> and the outer member <b>55</b> at which the locking balls are fully released from the annular recess <b>36</b> is referred to as the second relative position in the specification and in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the inner piston <b>56</b> prevents inward flexing of the petals <b>63</b>, so that the auxiliary tool <b>50</b> is securely locked to the closure element <b>10</b>. Also, in this position the recess <b>75</b> on the inner piston has moved so far that it registers with the downstream trigger <b>73</b> (second retainer device). The downstream end of the downstream trigger <b>73</b> is forced into the recess <b>75</b> by the action of the spring <b>87</b>, and blocks the longitudinal upstream motion of the inner piston <b>56</b> with respect to the outer member <b>56</b> when the closure element <b>10</b> is unlatched.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">By further pushing on the auxiliary tool <b>50</b> in downstream direction the closure element <b>10</b> is outwardly removed from the bit body <b>6</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Suitably the auxiliary tool can be hung off in the bottom hole assembly, so that it can easily be retrieved. The auxiliary tool can for example be mounted on the lower end of a logging tool, so that the logging tool can in this way be passed into the open borehole ahead of the bit body <b>6</b>, where logging measurements can be performed. If instead of a logging tool a fluid injection tool is used, fluid injection operations can be performed in the borehole, e.g. cementing, injection of lost circulation material, or jet cleaning of the borehole wall or of the bit cutters.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The well drilling bit <b>1</b> and auxiliary tool <b>50</b> are such designed that the closure element <b>10</b> can be re-latched to the bit body <b>6</b> if that is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When starting from the situation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the auxiliary tool is pulled in upstream direction, the downstream trigger <b>73</b> interacting with the recess <b>75</b> keeps the inner piston in the position relative to the outer member <b>55</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The key <b>90</b> interacts with the downstream camming rim <b>44</b> (which is only shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the sake of clarity) so as to bring the closure element <b>10</b> with attached auxiliary tool <b>50</b> into a predetermined angular orientation with respect to the bit body <b>6</b>. This predetermined angular orientation needs to be provided at a different, lower position of the auxiliary tool than before, when the auxiliary tool was to engage and connect to the closure element <b>10</b>. To this end the key <b>90</b> is elongated, or two keys are arranged at a suitable longitudinal spacing. In this way orientation occurs at different longitudinal positions. This could in principle also be achieved by making the guiding groove <b>41</b> longer. The advantage of the elongated key means is that less space is needed for the orienting device <b>40</b> as part of the wellstring or drilling bit. The elongation of the key means can be chosen longer than the length of the guiding groove.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is reached, the locking balls <b>35</b> are about to be forced back into the annular recess <b>36</b>. At this position, the button <b>45</b> activates the downstream trigger <b>73</b> so that it is released from the recess <b>75</b>, and the inner piston <b>56</b> including the plunger <b>64</b> at its downstream end can be moved in upstream direction. The inner sleeve <b>25</b> including the recesses <b>37</b> shifts upwardly, and the locking balls are locked again into the annular recess <b>36</b>. At this stage the bit body and closure element are interconnected again.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">After interconnecting, the auxiliary tool can be disconnected again from the closure element. To this end the inner piston is moved to the position relative to the outer member as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and no longer blocks inward flexing motion of the petals <b>63</b>. Therefore, by further pulling the auxiliary tool up, e.g. from surface, the petals <b>93</b> disengage from the recesses <b>39</b>, and to this end the upstream edges are slightly bevelled as shown in the drawing. After pulling slightly further, the button <b>45</b> disengages from the upstream trigger <b>72</b> which will subsequently prevent the inner piston from moving in downstream direction again.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shall be clear from the foregoing discussion, the present invention allows fail-safe removal of the closure element of a well drilling bit, by simply passing/pushing the auxiliary tool down the drill string (e.g. by using tubing extending to surface or pumping). The invention in particular prevents that the closure element can be lost in the well bore. Also, fail-safe re-connecting is possible by simply passing/pulling the auxiliary tool up again (e.g. by tubing or wireline).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An alternative embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed. This embodiment relates to a wellstring assembly suitable for performing an operation (such as drilling) in relation to a borehole and/or earth formation external of the wellstring in the borehole, in the course of which operation, it is desired to have access to the borehole exterior of the wellstring. Different from the embodiment discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, the present embodiment does not require a special well-drilling bit, in that access to the borehole can be provided by opening up the wellstring above the drill bit. Operations in the open borehole outside of the wellstring can be performed through the opening at the lower end of the upper part of the wellstring assembly.</p>

The first wellstring part will hereafter also be referred to as the upper wellstring part <b>108</b> and the second wellstring part as the lower wellstring part <b>105</b>. The lower wellstring part <b>105</b> has an upper end <b>110</b> and a lower end <b>111</b>, and at the lower end in this case a conventional drill bit <b>112</b> is attached. The lower wellstring part <b>105</b> can also include other elements of a bottom hole assembly such as a drill collar, directional steering devices, mud motor, measurement-while-drilling system (not shown).

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-15</figref>, and with reference to these Figures an orienting device will be discussed for angularly orienting an elongated tool such as the auxiliary tool when moving through the orienting device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-13</figref> such an orienting device has been indicated with reference numerals <b>40</b>, <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A certain angular orientation between the auxiliary tool and the second well string part is preferred for a fail-safe operation of the latching means, both when the auxiliary tool is lowered into the wellbore, and also when it is retracted again. This allows the correct re-positioning of the wellstring interconnection means for reconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the art of drilling it is known to use so-called mule-shoe devices, which serve to assure that equipment that is lowered in a drill string lands at a predetermined longitudinal position and angular orientation. In a mule-shoe device the landing position is determined by the cooperating action of a key and a circumferential camming rim, which camming rim is arranged so as to guide the key into a slot when the equipment is lowered into the drill string. When the key is in the slot the predetermined longitudinal position and angular orientation have been reached.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The key can be arranged to project inwardly from the inner wall of the drill string, or to project outwardly from the outer surface of the equipment, and the camming rim and slot are arranged on outer surface of the equipment or the inner wall of the drill string, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The present invention also provides an orienting device for angularly orienting an elongated tool, such as the auxiliary tool discussed hereinbefore, when moving longitudinally inside a tubular wellstring irrespective of the direction of the longitudinal motion.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">To this end there is provided an orienting device for angularly orienting an elongated tool when moving longitudinally through a passageway in the orienting device, wherein the elongated tool at its outer wall is provided with an outwardly projecting key, wherein the inner wall of the passageway is provided with two guiding rims forming a central guiding groove through which the key can pass, the guiding groove having upstream and downstream ends, further with an upstream camming rim extending from a position upstream of the guiding groove to the upstream end of the guiding groove fully around the inner wall, and with a downstream camming rim extending from a position downstream of the guiding groove to the downstream end of the guiding groove fully around the inner wall, wherein the camming rims and the guiding rims project sufficiently into the passageway so as to engage, when the elongated tool is moved through the tubular member, the key and to guide the key into the guiding groove, thereby angularly orienting the elongated tool.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The upstream and downstream camming rims of the orientation device according to the invention allow orienting of the elongated tool irrespective of the direction of longitudinal motion. The central guiding groove through which the key can pass determines the angular orientation of the elongated tool, and allows the elongated tool to pass on, with a predetermined orientation, through and beyond the orienting device in either direction.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Preferably, the guiding groove is arranged substantially parallel to the central longitudinal axis, so that the angular orientation of the elongated tool after passing through the orienting device is the same irrespective of the direction of longitudinal motion.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In connection with the present invention the passageway of the orienting device forms part of the passageway of the first wellstring part.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">There is also provided a self-orienting elongated tool for assuming a predetermined angular orientation when moving longitudinally through a passageway for the elongated tool, wherein the inner wall of the passageway is provided with a radially inwardly projecting key, wherein the outer wall of the elongated tool is provided with two guiding rims forming a central guiding groove through which the key can pass, the guiding groove having upstream and downstream ends, further with an upstream camming rim extending from a position upstream of the guiding groove to the upstream end of the guiding groove fully around the outer wall, and with a downstream camming rim extending from a position downstream of the guiding groove to the downstream end of the guiding groove fully around the outer wall, wherein the camming rims and the guiding rims project sufficiently outwardly from the outer wall so as to engage, when the elongated tool is moved through the passageway, the key and to guide the guiding groove over the key, thereby angularly orienting the elongated tool.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the schematic embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> the orienting device <b>301</b> is shown as a substantially cylindrical tubular member <b>302</b> having a passageway <b>303</b> with a central longitudinal axis <b>304</b>. The tubular member suitably forms part of the first wellstring part (<b>6</b>, <b>108</b>) The orienting device <b>301</b> serves for angularly orienting the substantially cylindrical elongated tool <b>305</b>, when it is moved longitudinally through the passageway <b>303</b> of the orienting device <b>301</b>, as indicated by the arrows <b>306</b>. The elongated tool <b>305</b> at its outer wall <b>308</b> is provided with a radially outwardly projecting key <b>310</b>, corresponding to the key <b>90</b> shown discussed above. The sum of the diameter of the elongated tool <b>305</b> and the radial thickness of the key <b>310</b> is smaller than the inner diameter of the cylindrical tubular member <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The key <b>310</b> is suitably elongated in longitudinal direction as shown in the Figure, with tapering upstream and downstream ends resulting in a boat-like shape. The key can also be formed by two parts that are spaced apart in longitudinal direction by a suitable distance. The distance can be less then, but also more than the length of the guiding groove <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Suitably the key is mounted on the elongated tool in such a way that it has some radial flexibility, e.g. by supporting the key by one or more springs. However, the radial flexibility should be such that even when the key is fully retracted, it extends radially far enough out such that it cannot be forced over a camming rim, so that it must be deflected.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Optionally, one or two anti-collision buttons are arranged upstream and/or downstream of the key <b>310</b> and slightly angularly displaced, like the tip shown with reference numeral <b>316</b>, which is also supported by a spring.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The inner wall <b>312</b> of the tubular member is provided with a central guiding groove <b>315</b> formed by two rims <b>317</b>, <b>18</b> projecting out of the inner wall <b>312</b>. The spacing between the rims <b>317</b> and <b>318</b> is somewhat larger than the width of the key <b>310</b>, so as to allow the key to pass through the guiding groove <b>315</b>. The rims <b>317</b>, <b>318</b> of this embodiment are arranged substantially parallel to the central axis <b>304</b>. There is further arranged an upstream camming rim formed by the rims <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>322</b><i>b</i>. Each of the rims <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>322</b><i>b </i>forms an extension of one of the rims <b>317</b>,<b>318</b> from the upstream end <b>319</b> of the guiding groove <b>315</b>, and spirals halfway around the inner wall <b>312</b> to a point <b>325</b> upstream of the guiding groove <b>315</b> where the rims <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>322</b><i>b </i>join. Substantially symmetrically to the upstream camming rim a downstream camming ream is arranged, formed by the rims <b>328</b><i>a</i>, <b>328</b><i>b</i>. Each of the rims <b>328</b><i>a</i>, <b>328</b><i>b </i>extends from one of the rims <b>317</b>,<b>318</b> at the downstream end <b>329</b> of the guiding groove <b>315</b>, and spirals halfway around the inner wall <b>312</b> to a point <b>330</b> downstream of the guiding groove <b>315</b> where the rims <b>328</b><i>a</i>, <b>328</b><i>b </i>join.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The free diameter of the passageway <b>303</b> as defined by the rims <b>317</b>,<b>318</b>,<b>322</b><i>a</i>,<b>322</b><i>b</i>,<b>328</b><i>a</i>,<b>328</b><i>b </i>is slightly larger than the diameter of the elongated tool <b>305</b> (not taking the thickness of the key <b>10</b> into account). The radial thickness of the key and of the rims are selected such that the key can be reliably guided by the rims, for example, in the order of 1-10 mm or more, but with careful design also smaller rims can be used. For an inner diameter of 6 cm (2.5 inch) of the tubular member, a suitable overall length from point <b>325</b> to point <b>330</b> is 25-40 cm. This allows the orienting device to be arranged as part of a shank of a well drilling bit of 15 cm (6 inch) or 21 cm (8.5 inch) diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">During normal operation of the orienting device of this embodiment the elongated tool <b>305</b>, such as the auxiliary tool <b>30</b> discussed hereinbefore, is lowered through the wellstring of which the orienting device forms part, until the elongated tool slides into the tubular member <b>302</b> and the key <b>310</b> engages the upstream rim <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>322</b><i>b</i>. Should the key happen to approach exactly the point <b>325</b>, the slightly angularly displaced anti-collision button <b>316</b> engages the camming rim first, and deflects the tool slightly to one side so that the key does not run against point <b>325</b>. Contrary to the key <b>310</b>, the anti-collision button is supported such by its spring that it can retract sufficiently so that it can run over a camming rim, for example in the case that the anti-collision button runs against point <b>325</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">At further lowering the rim exerts a torque on the key <b>310</b>, either left-handed or right-handed depending on which of the rims <b>322</b><i>a </i>and <b>322</b><i>b </i>is engaged by the key <b>310</b>. The elongated tool is thereby angularly deflected until the key slides into the guiding groove <b>315</b>. With the key <b>310</b> in the guiding groove <b>315</b> the elongated tool <b>305</b> is angularly oriented with respect to the orienting device <b>301</b> and the attached drill string.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The elongated tool can be further lowered so that the key leaves the guiding groove <b>315</b> at the side of the downstream rim. When no torque is applied on the elongated tool itself the key <b>310</b> will not normally engage the rims <b>328</b><i>a</i>, <b>328</b><i>b </i>when the elongated tool is moved completely through the passageway <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The elongated tool <b>305</b> can then for example be operated through a well-drilling bit suitable for through-bit operation which is attached at the downstream side of the orienting device.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When the elongated tool is to be retracted again, it can in general be in an arbitrary angular orientation. During retracting the key <b>310</b> will then engage the downstream rim <b>328</b><i>a</i>,<b>328</b><i>b</i>, and the elongated tool <b>305</b> will be angularly deflected until it slides into the guiding groove <b>315</b>. Since the guiding groove <b>315</b> is arranged parallel with the axis <b>304</b> of the tubular member <b>302</b>, the guiding groove <b>315</b> ensures an angular orientation which is the same as it was during lowering. With the auxiliary tool <b>30</b> as elongated tool <b>305</b> the predetermined angular orientation ensures correct operation of the latching/unlatching means.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">It shall be clear that this orientation is provided at a known, more downstream, position when the elongated tool is retracted in upstream direction, than when inserting it in downstream direction. The length of the key <b>310</b> and of the guiding groove determines the spacing between these positions. Using an elongated key allows a substantial spacing even for a short guiding groove. For use with the present invention the cooperating guiding groove and key are so arranged that, only when the key is properly oriented by the guiding groove, the auxiliary tool can connect to the second wellstring part. When retracting the predetermined angular position allows fail-safe interconnection of the wellstring parts.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The same can also be achieved in a complementary way by exchanging the roles of passageway and elongated tool. To this end the guiding rims/groove, and the upstream and downstream camming rims are arranged on the outer surface of the elongated tool, and the key is arranged on the inner surface of a passageway through which the elongated tool can pass, e.g. a tubular member such as an orienting sub of a drill string. The arrangement of the rims and guiding grooves can be analogous to the embodiment discussed with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In particular, the elongated tool can preferably have substantially cylindrical shape with the rims projecting out of the cylindrical wall, and the plan view of the unrolled outer surface of the elongated tool can be the same as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Such an elongated tool is self-orienting when moving longitudinally through the passageway with key on the inner wall. The elongated tool can be provided with connecting means to other equipment, so that the elongated tool can serve as an orienting means for that other equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The orienting device of the present invention suitably has the form of an orienting sub arranged in the lower part of the upper wellstring part. It can be an integral part of the bit body as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that no separate orienting sub is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The auxiliary tool can be the elongated tool itself, it can be connectable to the elongated tool, or it can be separate therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">While the illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described with particularity, it will be understood that various other modifications will be readily apparent to, and can be easily made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the following claims be limited to the examples and descriptions set forth herein but rather that the claims be construed as encompassing all features which would be treated as equivalents thereof by those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains.</p>
