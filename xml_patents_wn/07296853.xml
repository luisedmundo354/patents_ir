<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the reference number <b>10</b> designates a chair according to the present invention. The chair <b>10</b> comprises a fixed base structure <b>12</b> bearing a seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The fixed base structure <b>12</b> comprises two front legs <b>16</b>, two rear legs <b>18</b> and a cross member <b>20</b> situated at the top end of the legs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. The front and rear legs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> extend downwards starting from the cross member <b>20</b> and are respectively inclined forwards and backwards relative to a vertical plane passing through the cross member <b>20</b>. In the illustrated example, the legs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and the cross member <b>20</b> are constituted by metallic tubular elements welded to each other. The legs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are preferably provided at their lower ends with pivotable wheels <b>22</b>. The longitudinal axes of the legs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are contained in respective vertical planes, parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The front legs <b>16</b> and the rear legs <b>18</b> are mutually offset in order to allow the mutual nesting of the base structures <b>12</b> when two identical chairs are approached to each other horizontally in the longitudinal direction. In the illustrated example, the distance between the front legs <b>16</b> in transverse direction is less than the distance between the rear legs <b>18</b>. In other words, each front leg <b>16</b> is displaced in transverse direction inwards relative to the rear leg <b>18</b> of the same side of the chair. In nested configuration, the front legs <b>16</b> of a first chair are inserted between the rear legs of a second chair.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> comprises a seat portion <b>24</b> and a backrest portion <b>26</b>. In the example shown in the figures, the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> is constituted by a monolithic element made of plastic material, e.g. injection molded. Alternatively, the seat portion and the backrest portion <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> could be two distinct elements fastened or articulated to each other. The backrest portion <b>26</b> can be fixed relative to the seat portion <b>24</b> or it can be tiltable backwards under the thrust exerted by the user's back. The backrest portion <b>26</b> can also be fixed relative to the seat portion <b>24</b> and elastically deformable in order to tilt backwards under the user's thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In any case, the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> forms an autonomous constructive element borne by the fixed support structure <b>12</b>. Consequently, the seat and the backrest are not connected to the support structure <b>12</b> separately from each other. On the contrary, the seat and the backrest are mutually connected in fixed or articulated fashion and they form a constructive assembly <b>14</b> which is connected to the support structure <b>12</b> in the manner described below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> comprises two support flanges <b>28</b> fastened on the lower side of the seat portion <b>24</b>. As shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each support flange <b>28</b> is preferably constituted by a metal plate element having a cross section with reversed U shape with a flat upper wall <b>30</b> and two mutually parallel lateral walls <b>32</b>. The lateral walls <b>32</b> of each support flange <b>28</b> are provided with respective openings <b>36</b> with reversed U shape. Each upper wall <b>30</b> is provided with holes <b>34</b> for fastening, e.g. by means of screws, the support flange <b>28</b> to the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each support flange <b>28</b> bears an articulation element <b>38</b> housed between the lateral walls <b>32</b> of the support flange <b>28</b>. Each articulation element <b>38</b> is fastened to the respective support flange <b>28</b>, e.g. by means of a plurality of pivot pins <b>39</b> that are inserted through aligned holes of the lateral walls <b>32</b> and of the articulation element <b>38</b>. Each articulation element <b>38</b> has a semi-cylindrical articulation seat <b>40</b> and has guiding formations <b>42</b> on its upper surface. Each articulation element <b>38</b> is also provided at its front end with an upwardly turned tab <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cross member <b>20</b> of the fixed support structure <b>12</b> bears two stop elements <b>46</b>, fixed relative to the cross member <b>20</b>. Each stop element <b>46</b> can be formed, for example, by a bent piece of metal plate provided with two parallel walls <b>48</b> with aligned holes into which is inserted the cross member <b>20</b>. The stop elements <b>46</b> can be fastened to the cross member <b>20</b> for example by welding. Each stop element <b>46</b> can be provided with a block <b>50</b> fastened, e.g. by means of a rivet <b>52</b>, to a bridge portion <b>54</b> that extends between the parallel walls <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each support flange <b>28</b> is connected in articulated fashion to the cross member <b>20</b>. In particular, each support flange <b>28</b> with the respective articulation element <b>38</b> is free to rotate relative to the cross member <b>20</b> around a transverse horizontal axis <b>56</b> coinciding with the longitudinal axis of the cross member <b>20</b>. Said articulation element <b>38</b> is positioned between the two parallel walls <b>48</b> of the respective fastening member <b>46</b>. The articulated connection of the support flange <b>28</b> relative to the cross member <b>20</b> is completed by means of an Ω shaped element <b>58</b> fastened, e.g. by means of screws <b>60</b>, to the respective articulation element <b>38</b>. A half-shell <b>62</b> made of material with low friction coefficient can be positioned between the Ω shaped element <b>58</b> and the outer surface of the cross member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that the seat-backrest <b>14</b>, being fastened to the two support flanges <b>28</b>, can oscillate around the transverse axis <b>56</b>. The oscillating motion of the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> relative to the fixed base structure <b>12</b> has two stop positions. The first stop position is defined by the abutment between the support flanges <b>28</b> and the stop elements <b>46</b>. More specifically, said abutment is defined by the contact position between the upper planar surface <b>30</b> of the support flanges <b>28</b> with the bridge elements <b>54</b> of the stop elements <b>46</b>. This first end stop position corresponds to the position of normal use of the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A second stop position is represented by the condition in which the front part of the seat portion <b>24</b> abuts against the front legs <b>16</b>. In this second stop position, the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> is inclined forwards, with the seat portion <b>24</b> inclined downwards. It should be noted that, to avoid interference during the forward tilting of the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b>, the support flanges <b>28</b> are moved in the transverse direction towards the interior relative to the front legs <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> is provided with a locking device to lock the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> in the position of normal use shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the locking device comprises two cursors <b>64</b>, each of which is slidable in orthogonal direction relative to the axis of articulation <b>56</b>. Each cursor <b>64</b> is preferably constituted by bent metal plate and its cross section is substantially shaped a reversed U. Each cursor <b>64</b> is positioned between the articulation element <b>38</b> and the respective support flange <b>28</b> and it slidably engages the guiding formations <b>42</b> of the articulation member <b>38</b>. A helical compression spring <b>66</b> is positioned between the tab bent towards the side <b>44</b> of the articulation element <b>38</b> and a front wall <b>68</b> of the cursor <b>64</b>. The helical spring <b>66</b> tends to thrust the respective cursor <b>64</b> towards a blocking position. Each cursor <b>64</b> has at its rear end an engagement formation <b>70</b> with a rounded lower surface. The engagement formation <b>70</b> is destined to engage the block <b>50</b> of a respective stop member <b>46</b>. The two cursors <b>64</b> are fastened to the ends of an unlocking lever <b>72</b>, preferably constituted by a metal rod bent into a Ω shape. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ends <b>74</b> of the unlocking lever <b>72</b> are inserted into transverse holes <b>76</b> of the cursors <b>64</b>. The ends <b>74</b> of the unlocking lever <b>72</b> also slidably engage slots <b>78</b> formed in the lateral walls <b>32</b> of the support flanges <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, the operation of the locking device is as follows. In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the engagement formations <b>70</b> of the cursors <b>64</b> engage the lower surface of the blocks <b>50</b> of the arresting elements <b>46</b>. In this position, the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> is locked in the position of normal use because the abutment between the arresting formations <b>70</b> of the cursors <b>64</b> and the arresting elements <b>46</b> prevents the forward rotation of the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the unlocking lever <b>72</b> is pulled forward in the direction indicated by the arrow <b>80</b>, the cursors <b>64</b> are moved forward against the thrust of the springs <b>66</b>. It can be noted that in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the engagement formations <b>70</b> of the cursors <b>64</b> are disengaged from the blocks <b>50</b> of the arresting members <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After disengaging the cursors <b>64</b>, the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> is free to rotate forward as indicated by the arrow <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As indicated previously, the forward rotation of seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> is delimited by the abutment condition between the front end of the seat with the legs <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To bring the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> back to the condition of normal use, it is sufficient to rotate upwards the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b>. The rounded shape of the engagement formations <b>70</b> of the cursors <b>74</b> causes the cursors <b>14</b> automatically to engage the locking elements <b>46</b> when the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> reaches the position of normal use.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The forward tilting of the seat-backrest assembly <b>14</b> enables to nest in the horizontal direction several identical chairs, with a high degree of mutual co-penetration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows two chairs <b>10</b>′, <b>10</b>″ according to the present invention in mutually nested position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the reference numbers with an apex refer to a first chair and the reference numbers with two apexes refer to a second chair. As can be noted, in the nested position, the front legs <b>16</b>′ of the first chair <b>10</b>′ are positioned between the rear legs <b>18</b>″ of the second chair <b>10</b>″. The front legs <b>16</b>′ of the first chair <b>10</b>′ extend underneath the front legs <b>16</b>″ of the second chair <b>10</b>″. The seat portion <b>24</b>′ of the first chair <b>10</b>′ is situated below and behind with respect to the seat portion <b>24</b>″ of the second chair <b>10</b>″.
