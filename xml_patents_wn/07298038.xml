<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit packaging, and more particularly to an integrated circuit package system including die stacking.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Integrated circuits are what power many of today's consumer electronics, for instance, cellphones, video cameras, portable music players, computers, etc. Integrated circuits are employed in a multitude of environments, and consequently their packaging must protect them from various environmental conditions of contamination, such as, moisture, temperature, mechanical vibration, and even physical abuse.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As customer demand improves integrated circuit (IC) performance, faster, more reliable, and higher-density circuits, need to be produced. Various techniques, such as, flip chip, gall grid array (BGA), chip on board (COB), and multi-chip modules (MCM), have been developed to meet the continued demands for improving system performance and hardware capabilities, while the space in which to provide these improved hardware capabilities continues to decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">MCM may include two or more chips stacked one on top of another (i.e.—vertically stacked). This mounting technique permits a higher density of chips or integrated circuits on the MCM substrate. The substrate may include one or more layers of electrically conductive material separated by dielectric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although vertically stacked MCM's may increase the effective density of chips, over that of horizontally placed MCM components, it has the disadvantage in that the MCM's must usually be assembled before the component chips and chip connections can be tested. These extra manufacturing steps can lead to increased cost and decreased product yield if the chips are defective.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another common problem associated with vertically stacked MCM's is that the bottom chip must be larger than the top chip to accommodate the plurality of bond pads located on the bottom chip. Due to the constraint of limited space available for mounting individual chips on a substrate, the larger configuration of the bottom chip decreases the number of chips per semiconductor wafer, and correspondingly, increases the cost of manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another problem of vertically stacked MCM's is the lack of sufficient electrical interconnections and signal routing possibilities between the chips themselves, and between the chips and the input/output terminals of the package. Consequently vertically stacked MCM's in a leadframe package format have typically been limited to a simple fan-out interconnection of the chips to the leads, with very limited chip-to-chip interconnection and signal routing capability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, despite recent developments in semiconductor packaging techniques, a need still remains for improved packaging methods of fabrication to increase semiconductor chip densities while efficiently using wafer space. In view of the ever-increasing need to save costs and improve efficiencies, it is more and more critical that answers be found to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides an integrated circuit package system including a leadframe with an aperture formed therein. An integrated circuit package is mounted to the leadframe over or under the aperture and a die is mounted within the aperture to the integrated circuit package.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain embodiments of the invention have other advantages in addition to or in place of those mentioned above. The advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The following embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments would be evident based on the present disclosure and that process or mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail. Likewise, the drawings showing embodiments of the invention are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown exaggerated in the drawing FIGS. In addition, where multiple embodiments are disclosed and described having some features in common, for clarity and ease of illustration, description, and comprehension thereof, similar and like features one to another will ordinarily be described with like reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The term “horizontal” as used herein is defined as a plane parallel to the plane or surface of the leadframe, regardless of its orientation. The term “vertical” refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms, such as “on”, “above”, “below”, “bottom”, “top”, “side” (as in “sidewall”), “higher”, “lower”, “upper”, “over”, and “under”, are defined with respect to the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">What follows is a brief description of a generalized process flow overview for the manufacturing of an integrated circuit package system including a stacked die.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The process flow begins with loading a leadframe into an apparatus for processing. The apparatus manipulates the leadframe by forming an aperture in a portion of the leadframe. A package is then mounted to the leadframe. The package may be a known good die package and may be mounted to cover the exposed aperture. The package is then adhered to the leadframe by a reflow process.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After adhering the package to the leadframe, an epoxy is dispensed on an exposed portion of the package. The exposed portion of the package may occur within the aperture and may include a substrate. A die is then attached to the epoxy on the package. The epoxy securing the die is then cured.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After securing the die to the package, the die is interconnected to the leadframe by wire bonding. The leadframe, the package, the die and the wire bonds are then encapsulated by a molding compound, thereby increasing the durability and improving the reliability of the device operation. After encapsulation, a post-mold-cure (PMC) is then performed. The structure thus formed is then trimmed and formed for its intended purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The manufacturing process for fabricating an integrated circuit package system including a stacked die can be further described by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, which depict an exemplary manufacturing sequence for a generalized package assembly flow for the production of an integrated circuit package system <b>100</b>. As will be described further hereinbelow, the present invention provides for chip stacking on an integrated circuit package. The chip and the integrated circuit package may include active components, passive components, surface mount components, stacked components, and so forth, in numerous configurations and arrangements as may be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, therein is shown a sectional view of a leadframe <b>102</b> of the integrated circuit package system <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The leadframe <b>102</b> may be a dual row leadframe, for example, and includes electrical contacts <b>104</b> on the top and bottom. The electrical contacts <b>104</b> may be pre-plated with, but not limited to, an alloy of nickel (Ni) and palladium (Pd). The outer leads of the leadframe <b>102</b> may be pre-plated with, but not limited to, an alloy of lead (Pb), tin (Sn), gold (Ag) and copper (Cu). The outer leads are typically formed integrally with the inner leads and extend from the package body for establishing an external electrical connection.
