<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A railroad signaling method includes measuring a track current on a first track section, measuring a local voltage on the railroad line wires, determining whether a magnitude of the track current meets or exceeds a threshold value independent of the local voltage, and determining whether the track current and the local voltage are nominally in phase with one another in a manner that is independent of the track current measuring step. A first signal is provided only if the magnitude is determined to meet or exceed the threshold and the track current and local voltage are determined to be nominally in phase. The first signal is an indication that a train is not present in the track section, that the track section does not have a broken rail, and that the insulated joints that bound the track section do not include a fault condition. An associated relay arrangement is also provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to signaling system for railroads, and in particular to an electronic vital relay used to detect the presence of a train or a broken rail in particular track sections and/or track fault conditions between track sections.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Railroad systems, such as electrified railroad systems that employ power frequently track circuits, utilize signaling systems to provide signals for train operators and to control the operation of railroad crossing gates and warning lights. In such systems, each track circuit is bounded by insulated joints so that the presence of a train can be defined to a unique section of track. Railroad signaling systems use what is termed a vital relay or track relay to detect the presence of a train or a broken rail in particular track sections and/or track fault conditions between track sections (i.e., a fault in the insulated joint connecting two track sections). The signaling system only permits trains to pass and/or crossing gate and warning light systems to be in an off condition when the relay is in an operated condition. The relay will drop out of an operated condition if a train or a broken rail is in the particular track section being controlled or if there is otherwise a fault on the system which prevents an accurate detection of the presence of a train.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical use of a vital relay in a track circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a track section T of a stretch of electrified railroad is shown with its rails <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> illustrated by conventional single line symbols. The rails of section T are electronically insulated from the rails of the adjoining sections by the insulated joints <b>3</b>, also illustrated by conventional symbols. In order to provide a return circuit for the propulsion current, impedance bond windings <b>4</b> are connected across rails <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> at each end of section T and the associated ends of the adjoining sections. The center taps of each associated pair of bond windings <b>4</b> are connected by a lead <b>5</b> to provide a conventional circuit path through section T for propulsion current.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The signaling system for this stretch of railroad is based on continuous train detection using a track circuit for each track section such as section T. Signaling energy for the track circuits is provided from a central source S having a frequency of, for example, 50, 60 Hz or 100 Hz, and is distributed along the stretch of railroad by the line wires <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. Energy is supplied across the rails of section T at the left or transmitting end through a track transformer <b>8</b> from the line wires <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. Even though AC energy is used, the supply connections are such that the instantaneous polarity of the rails on each side of the insulated joints <b>3</b> are opposite, as indicated by the polarity markings at the rails <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. The supply connections include a selected resistor <b>11</b> which limits the current flow when a train shunts the rails <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> at the transmitting end. At the other or receiving end of section T, a vital relay circuit <b>12</b> is connected across the rails <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> through a track transformer <b>13</b> and a control coil <b>14</b> (alternatively, they may be directly connected) and to the line wires <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> through a local coil <b>15</b>. As discussed above, the vital relay circuit <b>12</b> detects the presence of a train or a broken rail and/or an insulated joint track fault condition in the section T, which detection is in turn used by the signaling system to provide signals for train operators.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As will be appreciated, if a train is not present and no rail is broken in the section T, a substantial amount of current will be present in the control coil <b>14</b>. However, if a train is present in the section T, it will shunt the rails <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, thereby resulting in little or no current in the control coil <b>14</b>. Similarly, there will be little or no current in the control coil <b>14</b> if a rail is broken in the section T. In addition, if the insulating joints <b>3</b> are intact, the current in the control coil <b>14</b> and the current in the local coil <b>15</b> will be substantially in phase. However, if a fault condition develops at the insulating joints <b>3</b>, the current in the control coil <b>14</b> and the current in the local coil <b>15</b> will be out of phase. These principles are utilized by vital relays to detect the presence of trains and fault conditions in track sections.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A common type of vital relay in use in electrified railroad systems is what is known as a vane relay. A vane relay operates by a principle similar to that of a watt-hour meter. A vane relay includes a vane positioned in the magnetic gap between two coils (i.e., the control coil <b>14</b> and the local coil <b>15</b>). The vane is responsive to the product of: (i) the current in the control coil, (ii) the current in the local coil, and (iii) the cosine of the angular difference of the current in the two coils. Maximum torque in a first direction is produced in the vane if current of a certain magnitude is present and the angular difference is zero (cosine of 0°=1), and maximum torque is produced in a second, opposite direction if current of a certain magnitude is present and the angular difference is 180° (cosine of 180°=−1). In addition, as the level of current decreases, the level of torque in either direction will decrease. The vane is fitted with a ladder structure so that a multiplicity of electrical contacts will close only when the vane rotates with sufficient torque in the first direction, which proves that the current in the two windings is nominally in phase and the current is of sufficient magnitude, i.e., there is not a train or a broken rail in the track section and there is no insulated joint fault condition. Just as important for railway train detection purposes, the contacts will not close if the phase relationship is reversed (indicates a fault at insulating joints <b>3</b>), regardless of the magnitude of the product of current and angular difference, or if the current in one of the windings is not of sufficient magnitude (i.e., substantially zero) (indicates the presence of a train or broken rail).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The problem with vane relays is that, as an electromechanical device with moving parts, they require considerable preventive maintenance to assure reliable operation. In addition, because vane relays are a product based device, the control current required to close the contacts is inversely effected by the local voltage. If local voltage regulation is poor, safety or reliable operation can be impacted. For example, if the local voltage decreases, track current decreases proportionally, but the control current required to maintain the track relay energized is increased. In such a situation, the potential exists for the track relay to drop and falsely indicate that the track circuit is occupied. Alternatively, at increased local voltage, the rail current is greater, but the current that is required to maintain the track relay energized is decreased. This increases the risk of the track relay's failure to drop in the presence of a broken rail.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention relates to a signaling method for a railroad system having a plurality of track sections that are connected to one another. Each of the track sections is bounded on either side by an insulated joint. Signaling energy is provided to the track sections by a source, and the source has line wires connected thereto. The method includes measuring a track current on a first one of the track sections at a first location thereon, wherein the signaling energy is provided to first one of the track sections at a second location thereon. The method further includes measuring a local voltage on the line wires, determining whether a magnitude of the track current meets or exceeds a threshold value independent of the local voltage, and determining whether the track current and the local voltage are nominally in phase with one another in a manner that is independent of the step of determining whether the magnitude of the track current meets or exceeds the threshold value. Finally, the method includes providing a first signal only if the magnitude is determined to meet or exceed the threshold value and the track current and the local voltage are determined to be nominally in phase with one another. The first signal is an indication-that a train is not present in the first one of the track sections, that the first one of the track sections does not have a broken rail, and that the particular insulated joints that bound the first one of the track sections do not include a fault condition. The first signal may cause a relay of the railroad system to be in an operated condition, or, alternatively, the first signal may be provided directly to a signaling system of the railroad system. In the preferred embodiment, the step of determining whether the track current and the local voltage are nominally in phase with one another includes synchronously rectifying the local voltage in response to the phase relationship between the local voltage and the track current.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention also relates to a vital relay arrangement for a railroad system having a plurality of track sections connected to one another. Each of the track sections are bounded by insulated joints. Signaling energy is provided to the track sections by a source having line wires connected thereto. The vital relay arrangement includes a control transformer for generating a track voltage signal that is proportional to a track current on a first one of the track sections at a first location thereon, wherein the signaling energy is provided to the first one of the track sections at a second location thereon, and a local transformer for generating a local voltage signal that is proportional to a local voltage on the line wires. The vital relay arrangement also includes a means for converting the track voltage signal to a DC voltage, a means for determining whether the DC voltage meets or exceeds a voltage threshold value, and a means, independent of the means for determining whether the DC voltage meets or exceeds a voltage threshold value, for determining whether the track voltage signal and the local voltage signal are nominally in phase with one another. The vital relay arrangement provides a first signal only if the DC voltage is determined to meet or exceed the voltage threshold value and the track voltage signal and the local voltage signal are determined to be nominally in phase with one another.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of an electronic vane relay architecture <b>20</b> according to the present invention. The electronic vane relay architecture <b>20</b> may be used in connection with the track configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein it is the vital relay circuit <b>12</b>. As described above, a prior art electromechanical vane relay operates by producing torque that drives mechanically linked metallic contacts wherein the torque is proportional to the product of: (i) the current in the local winding, (ii) the current in the control/track winding, and (iii) the cosine of the angular difference of those currents. The current portion of the product is an indication of whether a train or a broken rail is present in the track section being monitored, and the phase portion of the product is an indication of whether a fault condition exists between track sections. In contrast, in electronic vane relay architecture <b>20</b>, the determination of sufficient current and phase difference for operation of the relay are determined independently from one another in an electronic manner and combined as a logical (digital) AND function to deliver a DC output. In addition, the current determination is based solely on the control/track current, entirely independent of the local voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a control transformer <b>25</b> (connected to a track transformer such as track transformer <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (not shown)) operates as a current transformer, i.e., it translates the primary track current into a proportional voltage. The transfer function (secondary voltage/primary current) is controlled by the turns ratio of the control transformer <b>25</b> and the secondary load provided by resistor <b>30</b>. To achieve a particular input impedance, such as the input impedance of the vane relays used in many systems (i.e., 62 Ω), a resistor <b>35</b> is connected in series with the control transformer <b>25</b>. Diodes <b>40</b> and <b>45</b> take the output of the control transformer <b>25</b> and produce a DC voltage proportional to the track current. The DC voltage is input into level detector <b>50</b>. As is known in the art, a level detector is a device that takes a voltage as an input and outputs an oscillating signal, e.g., a square wave, if the input voltage is greater than or equal to a predetermined threshold voltage value, and outputs nothing if the input voltage is less than a predetermined threshold voltage value. Example level detectors are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,250, entitled “Vital Vehicle Movement Detector.” and U.S. Pat. No. 4,056,739, entitled “Fail-Safe Electronic Polarized Relay,” the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the predetermined threshold voltage value of level detector <b>50</b> is the voltage that is produced by control transformer <b>25</b> and diodes <b>40</b> and <b>45</b> in response to a control current of approximately 50 mA, and the output of level detector <b>50</b> when the predetermined threshold value is met or exceeded is a square wave switching at approximately 20 kHz. The output of level detector <b>50</b> is provided as one input into optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b>. The second input into optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b> and the output thereof will be described in greater detail herein. However, the important point to note is that the level detector <b>50</b> will output an oscillating signal only when the voltage output by control transformer <b>25</b> and diodes <b>40</b> and <b>45</b> meets or exceeds the predetermined threshold voltage value, i.e., when the control/track current meets or exceeds the predetermined threshold voltage value. Those values are chosen to be the values that indicate that a train is not present and there is no broken rail in the track section being monitored by the electronic vane relay architecture <b>20</b>. Thus, according to this aspect of the invention, the level detector <b>50</b> will output an oscillating signal only if there is sufficient current to indicate that neither a train nor a broken rail is present in the track section in question. This is determined by the control/track current and voltage only, and independent of the local voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the AC voltage output of the control transformer <b>25</b> (which is proportional to the control/track current) is input into high speed solid state relay <b>60</b>. The solid state relay <b>60</b> in turn optically transmits a control signal based on the received input voltage signal to synchronous switching element <b>65</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, electronic vane relay architecture <b>20</b> also includes a local transformer <b>70</b> (connected to the track supply line wires such as line wires <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (not shown)) that operates as a step down transformer, i.e., it translates the local voltage into a lower proportional AC voltage. That AC voltage is input into the synchronous switching element <b>65</b>. Thus, the synchronous switching element <b>65</b> has input thereto a control signal that controls the switching of the synchronous switching element <b>65</b> based on the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current and an AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage. The solid state relay <b>60</b> and the synchronous switching element <b>65</b> together operate as a synchronous rectifier. As used herein, the term synchronous rectifier shall refer to a device that takes two AC signals having the same frequency as inputs and outputs a first signal (e.g., half wave rectified) having a first polarity if the signals are in phase and a second signal (e.g., half wave rectified) having a second, opposite polarity if the signals are 180° out of phase. Other phase relationships (e.g., 90° out of phase) will result in a signal of mixed polarity (wherein the average voltage for a 90° out of phase condition will be zero). Thus, synchronous switching element <b>65</b> outputs a signal having a first polarity (e.g., positive) if the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current and the AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage are in phase with one another, and a signal having an opposite polarity (e.g., negative) if the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current and the AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage are 180° out of phase with one another. In particular, synchronous switching element <b>65</b> includes a switching mechanism that turns on and gates the AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage through during the positive half cycle of the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current, and turns off and gates nothing through during the negative half cycle of the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The output of synchronous switching element <b>65</b> is input into averaging filter <b>75</b>. Averaging filter <b>75</b> produces a DC output signal that is an average of the AC voltage signal that is input thereto. It should be noted that the inductance value of the inductor forming a part of the averaging filter <b>75</b> is extremely high, e.g., on the order of 50-150 Henries. The use of averaging filter <b>75</b> is preferred to ensure that level detector <b>80</b>, described below, responds only if the synchronous switching element <b>65</b> is operating properly. If a peak filter (simple capacitor) were used instead, a sequence of component failures could satisfy the level detector <b>80</b> regardless of phase differential between the control/track current and the local voltage. Of chief concern is a series of component failures, each of which is undetectable, followed by a shorted synchronous switching element <b>65</b>, the consequence being continued operation regardless of phase reversal and therefore continued operation of the output in the event of a failed insulated joint.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The voltage signal output by the averaging filter <b>75</b> is input into level detector <b>80</b>. As described above in connection with level detector <b>50</b>, level detector <b>80</b> will output an oscillating signal, e.g., a square wave, only when the voltage output by averaging filter <b>75</b> meets or exceeds a predetermined threshold voltage value, and will output nothing if the voltage output by averaging filter <b>75</b> is less than the predetermined threshold voltage value (including negative values). The predetermined threshold voltage value is chosen to correspond to the voltage that would be output by averaging filter <b>75</b> in cases where the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current and the AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage are nominally in phase, meaning they are in phase within a particular predetermined amount. For example, the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current and the AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage may be considered to be nominally in phase when they are at least within 45° of one another. Such tolerance to phase shift is necessary because in operation, the control input will typically lag the local input due to the inductance of the rails. Thus, as will be appreciated, level detector <b>80</b> will output an oscillating signal only when the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current and the AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage are nominally in phase, because it is only then that output of synchronous switching element <b>65</b> and averaging filter <b>75</b> will output a positive polarity signal of sufficient magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Diodes <b>85</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>95</b> and <b>100</b> are coupled to local transformer <b>65</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Diodes <b>85</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>95</b> and <b>100</b> produce positive and negative rectified (DC) voltage sources (+L) and (−L).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The output level detector <b>80</b> and positive source +L are input into a half-wave doubler circuit <b>105</b>. As is known in the art, a half-wave doubler circuit receives a DC source voltage and produces a DC output voltage of polarity opposite (the magnitude may differ) to that of its source voltage only if it also receives a second, oscillating input such as a square wave input. If either the source voltage or the oscillating input is missing, the half-wave doubler circuit outputs nothing. Essentially, a half-wave doubler circuit functions as a fail-safe AND gate, i.e. it produces an opposite polarity output only with an oscillating input AND an applied source voltage. Both inputs, oscillating and source voltage, are required for an opposite polarity output. With only one of the two inputs, no component or combination of component failures can produce an opposite polarity output. Examples of suitable half wave doubler circuits for use in the present invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, half-wave doubler circuit <b>105</b> will output a negative polarity voltage signal only if it receives an oscillating signal from level detector <b>80</b>. As noted above, level detector <b>80</b> will output an oscillating signal only when the AC voltage that is proportional to the control/track current and the AC voltage that is proportional to the local voltage are in phase. Thus, the output of half-wave doubler circuit <b>105</b> is an indicator of the phase relationship between the control/track current and the local voltage, i.e., if a negative polarity voltage signal is present at the output of the half-wave doubler circuit <b>105</b>, it means the two currents are nominally in phase.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The output of half-wave doubler circuit <b>105</b> is input into optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b>. As noted above, optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b> also receives the output of level detector <b>50</b>. The optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b> will output an oscillating signal only if: (i) the output of level detector <b>50</b> is an oscillating signal (meaning that the control/track current has been determined to be of sufficient magnitude to indicate that no train is present and not rail is broken), AND (ii) the output of half-wave doubler circuit <b>105</b> is a negative polarity voltage signal (meaning that the control/track current and local voltage are nominally in phase and thus there is not an insulated joint fault condition); if either signal is missing, then optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b> outputs nothing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The output of optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b> is input into half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b>. Also input into the half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b> is the negative source (−L) generated by diodes <b>85</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>95</b> and <b>100</b>. The half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b> will output a positive polarity signal only if the input it receives from optical isolator/vital AND gate <b>55</b> is an oscillating signal. Thus, a positive polarity signal output from the half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b> proves that the control/track current is greater than the predetermined threshold value (e.g., 50 mA) and that the local AND control/track currents are nominally in phase. Because control/track input current magnitude and phase comparison are independently determined according to the present invention, sensitivity to control/track current is not influenced by phase or magnitude of the local input.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The output of the half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b> may be used directly as an input to the railroad signaling system in question, wherein it acts as the vital relay output. However, in most applications, the output of the half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b> is not of sufficient power for that purpose. Thus, as an alternative, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the output of the half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b> may be input into output circuitry <b>115</b> that acts as a power conversion circuit for driving relay <b>120</b>, such as a PN-150 relay manufactured by the assignee of the present invention. The output circuitry <b>115</b> includes pulse width modulator <b>125</b> and power switching FETs <b>130</b> that drive a transformer <b>135</b>. Output of half-wave doubler #<b>1</b> furnishes the control voltage to the 1524 control chip; it produces the gate signals that alternately turn on the FETs driving the transformer. In this case, the output power of the half-wave doubler circuit <b>110</b> is insufficient to also act as the source for the power switching FETs <b>130</b>, and therefore the positive source +L is used as the source for the power switching FETs <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are a schematic diagram of the electronic vane relay architecture <b>20</b> according to one particular embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> show one particular implementation of the solid state relay <b>60</b> and the synchronous switching element <b>65</b>. The elements identified as K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b> are solid state relays, such as the model AQV225 relay sold by Aromat Corporation of New Providence, New Jersey. Switching speed is preferably on the order of about 100 microseconds. A diode symbol bounded by terminals a and b is intended as a representation of the control element, and the mechanical switch enclosed in the dashed box is intended as a representation of the switching element (pseudo contacts). Current through terminals a and b effectively produces a low resistance connection from terminals c to d. The control element and the switching element (pseudo contacts) share no common connection; they are isolated, being optically coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">On each positive excursion at A of the control transformer <b>25</b>, the pseudo contact of K<b>1</b> closes and a 200 microsecond negative going pulse is delivered to terminal e of the 555 timer <b>140</b>. In response, its output on pin f switches high for a much greater time, controlled by the resistor and capacitor connected to pins g &amp; h. Additionally, the pseudo contacts of K<b>2</b>, coupled to 12V to 5V DC to DC converter <b>143</b>, close and gate the triac <b>145</b> ON. The time is set to approximately 75% of one half the period of the operating frequency. For example, for 50 or 60 Hz applications, the time is set to approximately 6 milliseconds, and for 100 Hz applications, the time is set to approximately 3 milliseconds. It is expected B of the local transformer <b>75</b> is nominally in phase with A of the control transformer <b>25</b> and therefore the triac <b>145</b> is turned ON for a substantial portion of time during which A and B are simultaneously positive. It is important that the gate of the triac <b>145</b> be switched OFF before the negative half-cycle of A is initiated otherwise it will remain ON continuously and disrupt the synchronous rectification process. Limiting ON time of the gate of the triac <b>145</b> also allows for a moderate amount of phase shift of local with respect to control. By limiting the ON time of the gate of the triac <b>145</b> to 75% of one-half the period of the operating frequency, a phase shift of approximately 45 degrees can be tolerated. In track circuit operation, the control input will lag local due to inductance of the rails, and therefore, tolerance to phase shift is necessary. Thus, if A and B are nominally in phase, a positive voltage the level detector <b>80</b> and the half-wave doubler <b>105</b>, thereby producing a negative polarity voltage signal that, as discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, confirms the phase relationship of A and B.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If A and B are out of phase, meaning they are not nominally in phase, which can occur resulting from a failed insulated joint <b>3</b>, synchronous rectification will produce a negative voltage. The level detector <b>80</b> will not respond to a negative voltage and thus the failed insulated joint <b>3</b> is detected because the relay <b>120</b> will de-energize.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is shown that synchronous rectification is critical to the task of ensuring that local and control are essentially in phase but it is of great importance to ensure no component failures can mask the in phase relationship. For example, if the triac <b>145</b> or gate control thereof fails and the triac <b>145</b> is either shorted or ON continuously, the voltage at A<b>1</b> will revert to a sine wave instead of half-wave rectification. In that event, the averaging filter <b>75</b> will average the input to the level detector <b>80</b> to zero volts; the level detector <b>80</b> will not respond and the relay <b>120</b> will de-energize. The averaging filter <b>75</b> was selected instead of a peak filter because its failure modes preclude the possibility of continued operation with a series of component failures.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Peak filtering is realized with a single capacitor. Under normal conditions, a peak filter will produce a much greater voltage than an averaging filter like averaging filter <b>75</b>. However, the level detector <b>80</b> can be scaled to operate at a significantly greater voltage and, therefore, a peak filter could operate just as well. Sequential component failures are undetectable, however, and can result in inability to detect phase reversal as the result of a failed insulated joint <b>3</b>. With a single capacitor, if either connection opens, the level detector <b>80</b> input will revert to positive half sine wave DC pulses. The level detector <b>80</b> will respond with an output approximately one-half the time corresponding to each input pulse. The pulsating response will ripple through to the final output stage (<b>115</b>), producing reduced voltage to the relay <b>120</b>, but still sufficient to retain the relay <b>120</b> in an energized state. Thus, an open lead to the peak filter capacitor is undetectable. Subsequently, if the triac <b>145</b> or control thereof fails and it is continuously in conduction, the level detector <b>80</b> will continue its pulsating response with the relay <b>120</b> held energized. If phase reversal then occurs as a result of a failed insulated joint <b>3</b> it will be undetected and jeopardize integrity of the signal system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the averaging filter <b>75</b>, disconnection of either capacitor thereof decreases the voltage to the level detector <b>80</b> and response to an AC input averages an output to zero. If both capacitors open, the net DC that is produced will decrease, but the level detector <b>80</b> will marginally continue to function. Thereafter, if the triac <b>145</b> shorts, it will provide an AC input to the averaging filter <b>75</b>, which in turn will produce an output that is well blow the level required by level detector <b>80</b> (it will be at or near zero). The failure of triac <b>145</b> is thus detectable.</p>
