<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a network system, and more particularly, to an apparatus for generating a time slot in a network system for information terminals using a home phone network application (PNA) 2.0 protocol, which is included in each of the information terminal and indicates the time when data is transmitted, and a method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, home PNA 2.0 protocol has been suggested to constitute a home network. The home PNA 2.0 protocol, unlike home PNA 1.0 protocol, generates a time slot for determining when data will be transmitted to minimize the probability of data collision occurring between stations. The home PNA 2.0 protocol can transmit certain data after giving priority on the certain data using the time slot and thus can improve the quality of the transmitted data.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A time slot in the home PNA 2.0 protocol is generated using a carrier sense signal. However, it may be possible to generate a wrong carrier sense signal due to noise on a phone line. As a result, a wrong time slot may be generated by the wrong carrier sense signal. Therefore, it is important to generate a correct time slot irrespective of various carrier sense signals some of which may include errors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve the above-described problems, it is a first object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for generating a time slot in a network system based on home PNA 2.0 protocol, which is included in each information terminal and indicates the time when data is transmitted, and a method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a second object of the present invention to provide a recording medium, on which the method for generating a time slot is recorded as program codes that can be processed in a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the first object, there is provided an apparatus for generating a time slot in a home networking system for networking of information terminals, which is included in each of the information terminals and shows the time when data is transmitted. The apparatus includes a signal analyzer which receives a carrier sense signal indicating whether or not data exists on a network line, generates a counter control signal according to the level of the carrier sense signal, outputs a state signal for indicating whether or not effective data is received, whether or not data collision occurs, or whether or not an error happens to the carrier sense signal and a time counting value for generating a time slot using counter values provided in response to the carrier sense signal, a counting unit which counts a clock signal in response to the counter control signal and outputs the result of the counting as the counter values with respect to the length of a first level of the carrier sense signal and the length of a second level of the carrier sense signal where the second level is complementary to the first level, and a time slot generator which has regulations related to the period of time of each section of a time slot, generates a time slot according to the state signal output from the signal analyzer using the time counting value to meet the regulations, and stops generation of the time slot in response to the state signal for indicating that an error happens to the carrier sense signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the second object, there is provided a method for generating a time slot performed in an apparatus for generating a time slot which is included in each information terminal and shows the time when data is transmitted in a home networking system for networking of information terminals. The method includes (a) determining whether or not effective data is received, whether or not data collision occurs, or whether or not an error happens to the carrier sense signal using the carrier sense signal indicating whether or not data exists on a network line, (b) generating a time slot corresponding to the result of the determination if it is determined that effective data is received or it is determined that data collision occurs, and (c) stopping generation of the time slot if it is determined that an error happens to the carrier sense signal, and standing by to generate a new time slot.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, the present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an apparatus for generating a time slot according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus for generating a time slot includes a signal analyser <b>10</b>, a counting unit <b>20</b> having first through third counters <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b>, and a time slot generator <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the signal analyser <b>10</b> receives a carrier sense signal CS, which indicates whether or not data exists on a network line, and generates first through third counter control signals CNT1 through CNT3 for controlling the first through third counters <b>12</b> through <b>16</b>, respectively, according to the state of the carrier sense signal. In addition, the signal analyser <b>10</b> outputs a state signal S1, which indicates whether or not normal data is received, whether or not data collision occurs, or whether or not noise is generated, and a time counting value for generating a time slot to the time slot generator <b>18</b> in response to the outputs of the first through third counters <b>12</b> through <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The counting unit <b>20</b> counts a clock signal CLK in response to the first through third counter control signals CNT1 through CNT3 and outputs the results as counter values with respect to the lengths of the low and high sections of the carrier sense signal CS to the signal analyser <b>10</b>. Specifically, the counting unit <b>20</b> includes the first through third counters <b>12</b> through <b>16</b>. The first through third counters <b>12</b> through <b>16</b> count the clock signal CLK having a predetermined frequency, for example, a frequency of 16 MHz, in response to the first through third counter control signals CNT1 through CNT3, respectively, and output the results. The first counter <b>12</b> counts the clock signal CLK in the high section of the carrier sense signal CS in response to the first counter control signal CNT1, and the second and third counters <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> count the clock signal CLK in the low section of the carrier sense signal CS in response to the second and third counter control signals CNT2 and CNT3, respectively. The second counter <b>14</b> counts the clock signal CLK in the low section of the carrier sense signal CS just before an interframe gap (IFG) is detected in response to the second counter control signal CNT2, and the third counter <b>16</b> counts the clock signal CLK in the low section of the carrier sense signal CS directly after the IFG is detected in response to the third counter control signal CNT3. The result of counting the clock signal using the third counter <b>16</b> is used as the time counting value.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The time slot generator <b>18</b> memorizes time regulations for each section of a time slot and generates a time slot based on the state signal S1 output from the signal analyser <b>10</b> to meet the time regulations by using the time counting value output from the signal analyser <b>10</b>. In other words, the time slot generator <b>18</b> can recognize whether or not effective data is received or whether or not data collision occurs based on the state signal S1 and generates a time slot based on whether or not effective data is received or whether or not data collision occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) through <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>) are diagrams showing various carrier sense signals CS. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) through <b>2</b>(<i>d</i>), a carrier sense signal CS is maintained at a high level during data is received. In a case where normal data is received, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), the carrier sense signal CS is maintained at a high level for at least 92.5 μs. After the data is completely received, the carrier sense signal CS is maintained at a low level for at least 29 μs, which represents an interframe gap (IFG) section.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a case where data collision occurs, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), the carrier sense signal CS is maintained at a high level for 32-92.5 μs. After data is completely received, the carrier sense signal CS must be maintained at a low level for at least 29 s. If the carrier sense signal CS is maintained at a low level for less than 29 μs in a section <b>201</b> where an IFG section is supposed to exist, a time slot is determined to have an error. In this case, a home PNA terminal must abandon the time slot currently used and must generate a new time slot. If a terminal using a wrong time slot exists on a network, the terminal negatively affects the whole network, and thus the network falls into confusion. In addition, if data collision occurs, a back-off signal (BOS) section <b>202</b> exists. In the BOS section <b>202</b>, a maximum of three carrier sense signals CS of 10 μs may be generated. If there is no carrier sense signal CS, four or more carrier sense signal CS are generated, or a carrier sense signal CS greater than 10 μs exists in the BOS section <b>202</b>, a time slot is determined to have errors. Therefore, a new time slot must be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) is a timing diagram of a carrier sense signal in a case where data collision occurs after data is normally received, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>d</i>) is a timing diagram of a carrier sense signal in a case where data is normally received after data collision occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines whether or not a carrier sense signal CS currently input has an error by comparing the shape of the currently input carrier sense signal CS with the shapes of the carrier sense signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Then, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> outputs the result to the time slot generator <b>18</b> and thus can prevent the time slot generator <b>18</b> from generating a time slot in response to a wrong carrier sense signal CS.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a time slot suggested by home PNA 2.0 standards. According to the home PNA 2.0 standards, a time slot is supposed to have an IFG section that lasts for 29 μs at one end of a frame. In a case where data collision occurs, three BOS sections SIG<b>0</b>, SIG<b>1</b>, and SIG2 sequentially follow the IFG section, and each of the BOS sections SIG<b>0</b>, SIG<b>1</b>, and SIG<b>2</b> lasts for 32 μs. Eight priority slots, which will be loaded with data desired to be transmitted, follow the BOS sections SIG<b>0</b>, SIG<b>1</b>, and SIG<b>2</b>. In other words, a home PNA terminal decides the priority ranking of data desired to be transmitted and transmits the data according to the priority ranking and between the priority ranking, time delay for 21 μs exists. For example, data holding the seventh rank is transmitted directly after the BOS sections SIG0, SIG<b>1</b>, and SIG<b>2</b>, and data holding the fifth rank is transmitted 42 μs later from the BOS sections SIG<b>0</b>, SIG<b>1</b>, and SIG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a case where data collision does not occur, eight priority slots directly follow the IFG section without the BOS sections SIG<b>0</b>, SIG<b>1</b>, and SIG<b>2</b> intervening between the IFG section and the eight priority slots. In a case where the priority slots are not loaded with data, an unsynchronous section where data can be transmitted any time irrespective of the time slot comes after the priority slots.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram of a home network system based on home PNA 2.0 protocol. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, all terminals including active terminals, which get ready to transmit data, and passive terminals, which have no plan to transmit data, generate time slots using received signals and use the time slots.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a case where terminal <b>1</b> (<b>120</b>) is an active terminal, data is transmitted in the following way. Received data passes through a channel <b>302</b>, and a carrier sense signal detected through a bandwidth pass filter <b>303</b>, an ADC <b>304</b>, and a notch filter <b>305</b><i>a </i>and a carrier sense signal detector <b>305</b><i>b </i>of a demodulator <b>305</b> is output to a MAC <b>301</b>. The received data is output to a frame processor <b>306</b>. The MAC <b>301</b> includes the apparatus for generating a time slot shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the apparatus for generating a time slot generates a time slot using the carrier sense signal CS received from the demodulator <b>305</b> and outputs the time slot to the frame processor <b>306</b>. The frame processor <b>306</b> can determine the time TxOn when data will be transmitted based on the time slot provided by the MAC <b>301</b> and transmits the data to a modulator <b>307</b> according to the time slot. The data is transmitted to an object terminal via a DAC <b>308</b> and the channel <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the home PNA 2.0 standards, the transmission of a BOS section and a priority slot section must be started within 4 μs after the starting point of each time slot when being measured in a W1 line shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Accordingly, terminal designers must design terminals so that time delay caused by each of the terminals can be no greater than 4 μs. However, the time delay caused by each of the terminals may be no less than 4 μs according to the designers, and thus it is impossible to meet the regulation related to the transmission of the BOS section and the priority slot section. For example, in the case of the terminal <b>1</b> (<b>120</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, data is transmitted via the modulator <b>307</b>, the DAC <b>308</b>, and the channel <b>302</b>. During the data passes through the modulator <b>307</b>, the DAC <b>308</b>, and the channel <b>302</b>, the transmission of the BOS section and the priority slot section may not be started within 4 μs after the starting point of each time slot when being measured in the W1 line.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing a time slot generated by an apparatus for generating a time slot according to the present invention, in which a BOS section or a priority slot section begins directly after an IFG section that lasts for 29 μs in a W1 line irrespective of time delay caused by a terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the time generator according to the present invention can select the period of time, for which an IFG section lasts, from between 24 μs and 29 μs. If data transmission is delayed by as much as 2 μs by a terminal, the IFG section is adjusted to last for 26 μs. On the other hand, if data transmission is delayed by as much as 5 μs, the IFG section is adjusted to last for 24 μs. In other words, according to the amount of time delayed by the modulator <b>307</b>, the DAC <b>308</b>, and the channel <b>302</b> inside a terminal, the apparatus for generating a time slot according to the present invention, which is included in the MAC <b>301</b>, selects the time period of the IFG section from between 24 μs and 29 μs. Accordingly, the IFG section lasts for 29 μs in the WI line irrespective of time delay caused by the modulator <b>307</b>, the DAC <b>308</b>, and the channel <b>302</b> inside the terminal. Therefore, it is possible to meet the home PNA 2.0 standards, in which the transmission of a BOS section and a priority slot section must be started within 4 μs after the starting point of each time slot.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref> and Table 1, when the signal analyzer <b>10</b> is reset, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> is in an idle state <b>200</b>. Later, an input carrier sense signal CS may be in a high or low state. The signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines whether or not data is normally received or whether or not data collision occurs and generates a time slot based on the result of the determination. If the carrier sense signal CS which is in a high state is input in the idle state <b>200</b>, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> waits until the carrier sense signal CS becomes low. On the other hand, if the carrier sense signal CS which is low is input in the idle state <b>200</b>, the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes from the idle state <b>200</b> to an early low state <b>210</b>. Then, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> generates the second counter control signal CNT2 to allow the second counter <b>14</b> to count the clock signal CLK and thus check the duration of the low section of the carrier sense signal. As the result of the counting, if the low state of the carrier sense signal CS is determined to last for no less than 293 μs, which is the same as the sum of all time periods of the time slot shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the carrier sense signal CS is determined to belong to an unsynchronous section where data can be transmitted any time. The time slot generator <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> outputs a signal for indicating the unsynchronous section.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If a counter value CS_Low1 of the second counter <b>14</b> in the early low state <b>210</b> is shorter than 29 μs, which represents the duration of an IFG section, as shown in <b>401</b> condition of Table 1, the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes from the early low state <b>210</b> to an early high state <b>220</b>, and generation of a new time slot is prevented. In other words, in a case where a carrier sense signal CS is shorter than 29 μs, the carrier sense signal CS is determined as being caused by noise and is ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the early low state <b>210</b>, if the length of the low section counted by the second counter <b>14</b> is no less than 29 μs, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines the low section as an IFG section, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes from the early low state <b>210</b> to state <b>1</b> (<b>280</b>). The signal analyzer <b>10</b> generates the first counter control signal CNT1 and checks the duration of a high section of the carrier signal. If the high state of the carrier sense signal CS lasts for no less than 92.5 μs in the state <b>1</b> (<b>280</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that normal data is received. When the carrier sense signal CS becomes low, the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>405</b>) from the state <b>1</b> (<b>280</b>) to state <b>2</b> (<b>240</b>), and the signal analyzer <b>10</b> outputs a state signal S1 for indicating that data is normally received and a counter value CS_Low2 provided from the second counter <b>14</b> to the time slot generator <b>18</b>. The time slot generator <b>18</b> generates an appropriate time slot in response to the state signal S1 by using the counter value CS_Low2.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, in the state <b>2</b> (<b>240</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> compares the counter value CS_Low2 with the length of the IFG section. If the counter value CS_Low2 is smaller than the length of the IFG section, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that a wrong carrier sense signal CS is received. Then, the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>406</b>) to the early high state <b>220</b>, and simultaneously, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> generates an error signal ER for indicating that the carrier sense signal CS has an error to the time slot generator <b>18</b>. The time slot generator <b>18</b> initializes the time slot in response to the error signal ER and generates a new time slot. On the other hand, if the counter value CS_Low2 is greater than the length of the IFG section in the state <b>2</b> (<b>240</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> is maintained to be in the state <b>2</b> (<b>240</b>) for a while. Then, the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>407</b>) from the state <b>2</b> (<b>240</b>) to state <b>3</b> (<b>260</b>) when the carrier sense signal CS becomes high, and the signal analyzer <b>10</b> generates the first counter control signal CNT1 to allow the first counter to count the high section of the carrier sense signal CS.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If a counter value CS_High of the first counter <b>12</b> is no less than 92.5 μs in the state <b>3</b> (<b>260</b>), the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>409</b>) from the state <b>3</b> (<b>260</b>) to state <b>4</b> (<b>230</b>). If the counter value CS_High is no less than 32 μs and less than 92.5 μs, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that data collision occurs. Then, the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>408</b>) from the state <b>3</b> (<b>260</b>) to the early low state <b>210</b>, and the time analyzer <b>10</b> begins to generate a new time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the counter value CS_High is no less than 32 μs and less than 92.5 μs in the state <b>1</b> (<b>280</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that data collision occurs, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes from the state <b>1</b> to the state <b>4</b> (<b>230</b>). Next, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> generates the second counter control signal CNT2 to allow the second counter <b>14</b> to count the low section of the carrier sense signal CS. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), even in a case where data collision occurs, the carrier sense signal CS must be maintained in a low state for as much as the length of the IFG section. If the low section of the carrier sense signal CS do not last for as much as the length of the IFG section in the state <b>4</b> (<b>230</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that the carrier sense signal CS has an error, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>417</b>) from the state <b>4</b> (<b>230</b>) to the early low state <b>210</b>. In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the IFG section and the BOS sections must come after data collision occurs. Thus, the period of time, for which the low state of the carrier sense signal CS lasts, must be shorter than the sum of the time periods of the IFG section and the BOS sections, as shown in the <b>412</b> conditions of Table 1. In other words, if the counter value CS_Low2 of the second counter <b>16</b> meets the <b>412</b> conditions of Table 1 in the state <b>4</b> (<b>230</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that a BOS signal is normally generated, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>412</b>) from the state <b>4</b> (<b>230</b>) to state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>). If the counter value CS_Low2 is shorter than the length of the IFG section in the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that the carrier sense signal CS has an error, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>460</b>) from the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>) to the early high state <b>220</b>. Next, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> outputs the error signal ER to the time slot generator <b>18</b> to stop generating a time slot. If the counter value CS_Low2 meets the <b>411</b> conditions of Table 1 in the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>), in other words, if the counter value CS_Low2 is greater than the sum of the time periods of the IFG section and the BOS sections, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that the BOS signal is not generated, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes (<b>411</b>) from the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>) to the early low state <b>210</b>. The signal analyzer <b>10</b> generates the error signal ER to the time slot generator <b>18</b> to make the time slot generator <b>18</b> abandon the time slot being currently generated and generate a new time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>), the signal analyzer <b>10</b> generates the first counter control signal CNT1 to allow the first counter <b>12</b> to count the clock signal CLK and determines whether or not the carrier sense signal CS is maintained at a high state for as long as the duration of the BOS, in other words, whether or not the <b>414</b> conditions of Table 1 are satisfied. If the high state of the carrier sense signal CS lasts for as long as the duration of the BOS, the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> changes from the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>) to state <b>6</b> (<b>270</b>). According to the home PNA 2.0 standards, the BOS signal must be maintained at a high level for 10 μs, as described above. However, as shown in the <b>414</b> conditions of Table 1, a signal lasting for 9-17 μs is considered as the BOS signal. The signal analyzer <b>10</b> is maintained in the state <b>6</b> (<b>270</b>) for a while, and then the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> moves to the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>) when the carrier sense signal CS becomes high.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the <b>415</b> conditions of Table 1 are satisfied in the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>), in other words, if the first counter value CS_High is no less than 32 μs and less than 92.5 μs, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that data collision occurs, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> moves (<b>415</b>) to the state <b>4</b> (<b>230</b>). The signal analyzer <b>10</b> outputs the state signal S1 for indicating that data collision occurs and the counter value CS_Low2 to the time slot generator <b>18</b>. If the <b>416</b> conditions of Table 1 are satisfied in the state <b>5</b> (<b>250</b>), in other words, if the second counter value CS_High is no less than 92.5 μs, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that data is normally received, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> moves (<b>416</b>) to the state <b>2</b> (<b>240</b>). The signal analyzer <b>10</b> outputs the state signal S1 for indicating that data is normally received and the counter value CS_Low2 of the third counter <b>16</b> to the time slot generator <b>18</b>. If none of the <b>415</b> conditions, <b>414</b> conditions, and <b>416</b> conditions of Table 1 are satisfied, in other words, if the <b>413</b> conditions of Table 1 are satisfied, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> determines that the carrier sense signal CS has an error, and the state of the signal analyzer <b>10</b> moves (<b>413</b>) to the early low state <b>210</b>. Then, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> outputs the error signal ER to the time slot generator <b>18</b> to make the time slot generator <b>18</b> stop generating a time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, the signal analyzer <b>10</b> can determine whether or not the carrier sense signal CS being currently input has an error using a counting value output from the counting unit <b>20</b>, and accordingly, it is possible to generate a precise time slot by controlling the operation of the time slot generator <b>18</b> based on the result of the determination.</p>
