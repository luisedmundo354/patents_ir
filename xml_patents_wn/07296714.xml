<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention pertains generally to devices for dispensing a heated liquid and, more particularly, to a device for dispensing a heated liquid having a flexible hydraulic seal.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A typical dispensing device for supplying a heated liquid, such as a hot melt adhesive, generally includes a heated dispenser body constructed from a heat transferable metal, such as aluminum, brass, or stainless steel, and typically is coupled to a manifold, or other heater block, adapted to heat a liquid. The dispenser body includes a liquid inlet in fluid communication with the manifold to receive the heated liquid, and further includes a valve element that opens and closes a liquid outlet in communication with the inlet for dispensing discrete amounts of the heated liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The valve element is usually operated by pressurized air to dispense the heated liquid. As such, an air passage or chamber typically is located in an upper area of the dispenser body, i.e. at an end opposite the liquid outlet. This air passage usually contains an actuating element, e.g. a piston, connected to the valve element and may further cooperate with a spring return mechanism. Under sufficient air pressure, the piston and valve element may be moved in a direction away from the liquid outlet to discharge liquid. When the air pressure on one side of the piston is relieved, the spring return mechanism will automatically return the valve element to a normally closed position. Air pressure may also be used to close the valve element. The spring return mechanism may be used to adjust valve stroke such as by varying its compression, thereby varying the amount of air pressure required to open the valve. Adjustment of the spring compression will also adjust the biasing force used to close the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Notably, the dispensing devices related to the present invention generally situate at least one seal around the valve between the liquid passage and the upper area in an attempt to prevent heated liquid from entering the area. The seal usually is a standard O-ring, or spring-energized cup seal, tightly fit around the valve for axial movement therewith along an inner surface of the dispenser body. This seal arrangement, commonly referred to as a sliding-fit condition, can reduce the lifespan of the seal due to the reciprocating axial movement along the inner surface of the dispenser body. Also, costly, critical-surface machining on the surface of the valve element is required to provide the tight fit for the seal. Furthermore, the sliding-fit condition has a tendency to permit unfavorable leakage between the seal interface and the valve element. This leakage can reduce the performance of the dispensing device, for example, by decreasing the lifespan of the actuating element.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved device for dispensing heated liquids, such as hot melt adhesives, which eliminates or reduces hydraulic seal leakage and critical valve surface machining thereby reducing costs and extending the life of the dispensing device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides for a device for dispensing a heated liquid having a flexible hydraulic seal. To this end, the device includes a heated dispenser body having a liquid inlet in fluid communication with a heated manifold to receive a heated liquid, a liquid passage in communication with the liquid inlet, and a liquid outlet in communication with the liquid passage. The dispenser body further includes a valve element having an outer surface with a circumferential groove therearound and is adapted to selectively allow and prevent flow of the heated liquid through the outlet from the liquid passage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An inner surface of the dispenser body may include a stepped portion and further is provided with a plug situated about the valve element and adjacent the liquid passage. The stepped portion is spaced apart from the plug to define a recessed portion cooperating with the groove to define a cavity about the valve element. The plug preferably is threadably engaged with the inner surface of the dispenser body. In an alternate embodiment, the stepped portion and plug are switched such that the stepped portion is situated adjacent the liquid passage with the plug being spaced apart therefrom to define the recessed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A flexible seal is situated within the cavity separating the liquid passage containing the heated liquid and an upper area of the dispenser body. The seal is a standard O-ring type seal composed of an elastomeric material, such as a fluorelastomer, or may be a spring-energized cup seal. A first portion of the seal is configured to form a fluid-tight seal within the recessed portion and a second portion is configured to form a fluid-tight seal about the valve element during reciprocation thereof relative to the recessed portion. The seal is situated so that the second portion flexes about a central axis of the valve element during reciprocation while the first portion remains relatively stationary within the recessed portion. This seal arrangement prevents liquid from leaking out of the liquid passage past the flexible seal into the upper area and further helps extend the lifespan of the seal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The features and various advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a device <b>10</b> for dispensing a heated liquid (not shown), such as a hot melt adhesive, having a flexible hydraulic seal <b>12</b> generally includes a dispenser body <b>14</b> having a valve element <b>16</b> adapted to be pneumatically driven for dispensing discrete amounts of the heated liquid. One alternative to the device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> could be an electrically actuated dispenser device (not shown) instead of the pneumatically actuated dispenser device <b>10</b>. A suitable pneumatically driven device <b>10</b> that may be modified to incorporate the flexible hydraulic seal <b>12</b> of the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,155 to Byerly et al., which is hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The dispenser body <b>14</b> is adapted to be heated and is constructed from a heat transferable, non-interactive metal, such as aluminum, brass, stainless steel, or the like. The dispenser body <b>14</b> further is coupled by means commonly known in the art, such as bolts or screws, to a manifold <b>18</b>. The manifold <b>18</b> includes a chamber (not shown) for holding a liquid, a heating element <b>20</b> adapted to heat the liquid, a liquid outlet port <b>22</b> in communication with the chamber, and an air outlet port <b>24</b> for supplying pressurized air. The operation of the manifold <b>18</b> is well understood by one of ordinary skill in this field and delivers pressurized air and heated liquid to the dispenser body <b>14</b>, respectively, via the air and liquid outlet ports <b>24</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The dispenser body <b>14</b> further is provided with a liquid inlet <b>28</b> in fluid communication with the liquid outlet port <b>22</b> to receive the heated liquid, a liquid passage <b>30</b> in communication with the liquid inlet <b>28</b>, and a liquid outlet <b>32</b> in communication with the liquid passage <b>30</b>. More specifically, the liquid passage extends within the dispenser body <b>14</b> from the liquid inlet <b>28</b> into a nozzle <b>34</b> that is securely attached to the dispenser body <b>14</b> by means commonly known in the art, such as by bolts or screws. An end <b>35</b> of the nozzle is provided with the liquid outlet <b>32</b> such that heated liquid flows from the liquid inlet <b>28</b>, to the liquid passage, and out the device <b>10</b> through the liquid outlet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The dispenser body <b>14</b> also includes an upper area <b>36</b> provided with an air passage <b>38</b> in communication with air inlet <b>40</b> that receives and directs pressurized air from the air outlet port <b>24</b> to the air passage <b>38</b>. Air passage <b>38</b> is used to operate the valve element <b>16</b> as will be discussed below. O-rings <b>42</b> are respectively disposed about inlets <b>28</b>, <b>40</b> to seal these connections. Air and liquid inlets <b>28</b>, <b>40</b> respectively have annular lips <b>44</b> that hold O-rings <b>42</b> in place. The O-rings <b>42</b> provide a face seal with manifold <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the dispenser body <b>14</b> further includes an inner surface <b>46</b> having a stepped portion <b>48</b> and a plug <b>50</b> releasably and threadably engaged therewith adjacent the liquid passage <b>30</b>. The stepped portion <b>48</b> is provided spaced apart from the plug <b>50</b> to define a recessed portion <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the valve element <b>16</b> is situated substantially centrally within the dispenser body <b>14</b> and is adapted to selectively allow and prevent flow of the heated liquid from the liquid passage <b>30</b> through the liquid outlet <b>32</b>. More specifically, the valve element <b>16</b> has a valve tip <b>56</b> configured to engage a valve seat <b>58</b> such that when the valve tip <b>56</b> is engaged therewith, no pressurized fluid can travel from the liquid passage <b>30</b> through the liquid outlet <b>32</b> of the nozzle <b>34</b>, i.e., fluid remains within the liquid passage <b>30</b>. In the alternative, when the valve element <b>16</b> is disengaged from the valve seat <b>58</b>, then pressurized fluid is dispensed through the outlet <b>32</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> and <b>3</b>, the valve element <b>16</b> also includes an outer surface <b>62</b> having a circumferential groove <b>64</b> therearound cooperating with the recessed portion <b>52</b> to define a cavity <b>66</b> about the valve element <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With further reference to FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B, the flexible seal <b>12</b> is situated within the cavity <b>66</b> between the liquid passage <b>30</b> and the upper area <b>36</b> of the dispenser body <b>14</b>. A first portion <b>68</b> of the seal <b>12</b> is configured to form a fluid-tight seal within the recessed portion <b>52</b> and a second portion <b>70</b> is configured to form a fluid-tight seal about the valve element <b>16</b> during reciprocation thereof relative to the recessed portion <b>52</b>. This seal arrangement prevents liquid from leaking out of the liquid passage <b>30</b> past the flexible seal <b>12</b> and into the upper area <b>36</b>. The groove <b>64</b> and recessed portion <b>52</b> may be provided with rounded edges <b>126</b> to help maintain the integrity of the seal <b>12</b> during reciprocation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the seal <b>12</b> is a standard O-ring type seal but can be other seal types, such as a spring-energized cup seal, and the like, and can include any variety of shapes. The seal <b>12</b> is composed of an elastomeric material, such as a fluorelastomer, and more exemplary, a fluorocarbon. The seal <b>12</b> is adapted for high temperatures and can sustain temperatures of at least about 400° F. to 500° F. The size of the seal <b>12</b> advantageously is equal to or slightly larger than that of the cavity <b>66</b> so that the seal <b>12</b> is compressed therein to provide for a tight seal. A preferred seal <b>12</b> is distributed by Alltek Seal and Packing of Jacksonville, Fla. and identified as Model No. 2-102 V3819-75. Another preferred seal <b>12</b>, also distributed by Alltek Seal and Packing, is Model No. 2-102 FF500-75. In addition to being stable at high temperatures, both preferred seals have high tear resistance and low compression set at high temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the upper area <b>36</b> further includes actuating element <b>74</b>, i.e. a piston, cooperating with the valve element <b>16</b> and includes spring return mechanism <b>76</b> positioned to urge the piston <b>74</b> and, thus, the valve element <b>16</b> downward. Movement of the piston <b>74</b>, as further described below, is sufficient to overcome the force of spring <b>78</b> of the spring return mechanism <b>76</b> and move the valve element <b>16</b> upward to dispense heated liquid through the outlet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The piston <b>74</b> is provided with a glass impregnated PTFE disc <b>82</b> (sold as Rulon type AR by Furon Company) sandwiched between two rigid metal discs <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> that may be crimped or otherwise secured together. Disc <b>86</b> preferably is crimped into rigid engagement with valve element <b>16</b> by deforming a lower annular portion <b>88</b> thereof into a circumferential groove <b>90</b> contained in the valve element <b>16</b>. Likewise, an upper annular crimped portion <b>92</b> is deformed into a circumferential groove <b>94</b> in valve element <b>16</b>. Finally, the upper portion <b>92</b> of disc <b>84</b> is also deformed outwardly, as shown by crimped portion <b>96</b>, into firm engagement with disc <b>84</b> to hold the piston <b>74</b> together. As indicated above, pressurized air may be introduced into air passage <b>38</b> to move the piston <b>74</b> and valve element <b>16</b> away from valve seat <b>58</b> during a liquid dispensing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The upper area <b>36</b> of the dispenser body <b>14</b> further is provided with a seal assembly <b>102</b> disposed about the valve element <b>16</b> between the air passage <b>38</b> and liquid passage <b>30</b> to further seal these passages <b>38</b>, <b>30</b> from one another. Accordingly, the seal assembly <b>102</b> generally retains pressurized air within air passage <b>38</b> during operation of the device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pivoting force transfer element <b>106</b> is disposed between the spring <b>78</b> and valve element <b>16</b> to transfer the spring force to the valve element <b>16</b> and maintain valve element <b>16</b> in a normally closed position against valve seat <b>58</b>. A load screw <b>108</b> receives spring <b>78</b> and includes external threads <b>110</b> that engage internal threads <b>112</b> of a sleeve <b>114</b> secured to the dispenser body <b>14</b> in a manner to be described. Preferably, load screw <b>108</b> is formed of stainless steel and sleeve <b>114</b> is formed of brass. A lock nut <b>118</b> is threaded onto the outside of load screw <b>108</b> for allowing a spring adjustment to be locked in place. A machine screw <b>120</b> is preferably used to close a hole <b>122</b> within load screw <b>108</b>. Hole <b>122</b> may be used to insert a probe into device <b>10</b>, such as to determine whether valve element <b>16</b> is operating correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To assemble the dispenser body <b>14</b> and valve element <b>16</b>, the valve element <b>16</b> generally may be inserted into the dispenser body <b>14</b> from above and centrally positioned therein. Then, the seal <b>12</b> is placed around the valve tip <b>56</b> from below the dispenser body <b>14</b> and slid along the valve element <b>16</b> until the seal <b>12</b> is securely positioned within the groove <b>64</b>. The plug <b>50</b> then is threadably engaged with the inner surface <b>46</b> of the dispenser body <b>14</b> around the valve element <b>16</b> to wedge the seal <b>12</b> between the stepped portion <b>48</b> and plug <b>50</b> so that at least the first and second portions <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> of the seal <b>12</b>, respectively, seal within the recessed portion <b>52</b> and about the valve element <b>16</b>. The plug <b>50</b> and stepped portion <b>48</b> accordingly define the recessed portion <b>52</b> that cooperates with the groove <b>64</b> to define the seal cavity <b>66</b>. The spring return mechanism <b>76</b> and nozzle <b>34</b> then further may be installed and adjusted (as needed).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternate embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the stepped portion <b>48</b> and plug <b>50</b> are switched such that the stepped portion <b>48</b> is situated adjacent the liquid passage <b>30</b> with the plug <b>50</b> being spaced apart therefrom to define the recessed portion <b>52</b>. To assemble this embodiment, the plug <b>50</b> first may be provided around the valve element <b>16</b> then the seal <b>12</b> placed around and slid along the valve element <b>16</b> from the bottom until the seal <b>12</b> is securely positioned within the groove <b>64</b>. The valve element <b>16</b> is inserted into the dispenser body <b>14</b> from above and centrally positioned therein so that the seal <b>12</b> rests against the stepped portion <b>48</b>. The plug <b>50</b> then is threadably engaged with the inner surface <b>46</b> of the dispenser body <b>14</b> to wedge the seal <b>12</b> between the stepped portion <b>48</b> and plug <b>50</b> so that at least the first and second portions <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> of the seal <b>12</b>, respectively, seal within the recessed portion <b>52</b> and about the valve element <b>16</b>. It should be understood that other assembly methods may be equally suitable for assembling the dispenser body <b>14</b> having the flexible seal <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>, the valve element <b>16</b>, is initially situated in a fully closed positioned, i.e. the valve tip <b>56</b> meets the valve seat <b>58</b>, such that the second portion <b>70</b> of the seal <b>12</b> is flexed about a central axis <b>130</b> of the valve element <b>16</b> while the first portion <b>68</b> remains fixedly secured within the recessed portion <b>52</b>. Reciprocal movement of the valve element <b>16</b> with seal <b>12</b>, from this fully closed position, is described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">During operation of the device <b>10</b>, liquid is introduced under pressure into liquid inlet <b>28</b> such that liquid passage <b>30</b> is filled. Sufficient pressurized air is delivered to air passage <b>38</b> allowing the piston <b>74</b> to carry valve element <b>16</b> away from the valve seat <b>58</b>, thereby forcing transfer element <b>106</b> in a direction toward sleeve <b>114</b> until surface <b>132</b> contacts surface <b>134</b>. Pressurized liquid contained in liquid passage <b>30</b> will then flow through liquid outlet <b>32</b>. Notably, when the valve element <b>16</b> moves upward from the fully closed position to a fully open position, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the second portion <b>70</b> of the seal <b>12</b> similarly flexes, in a reverse direction, about the central axis <b>130</b> of the valve element <b>16</b> while the first portion <b>68</b>, again, remains fixedly secured within the recessed portion <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the pressurized air directed through air outlet port <b>24</b> is turned off or sufficiently reduced, spring <b>78</b> will force transfer element <b>106</b> to push valve element <b>16</b> so that the valve tip <b>56</b> rests against valve seat <b>58</b>, as again shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>, thus closing the liquid outlet <b>32</b>. It should be understood that there are other equally suitable ways to provide for movement of the valve element <b>16</b>. Other exemplary designs of the dispenser body <b>14</b> providing for such movement of the valve element <b>16</b> are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,155 to Byerly et al., which is hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The valve stroke, i.e. the amount of movement of the valve element <b>16</b> from a fully closed to a fully opened position, plays a key role in determining the amount of flexing of the seal <b>12</b>. This movement, or total reciprocation of the valve element <b>16</b>, for example, is no greater than about 0.016 inches, i.e. the second portion <b>70</b> of the seal <b>12</b> flexes no greater than about 0.008 inches about the central axis <b>130</b> in either direction. It is understood that other stroke lengths and dimensional parameters may be used depending on the application requirements and/or the desired flow rate. The stroke length may be easily and permanently set by moving valve element <b>16</b> against valve seat <b>58</b> and sleeve <b>114</b> against force transfer element <b>106</b> and then allowing sleeve <b>114</b> to back out under the force of spring <b>78</b> until reaching the desired stroke length. Then, sleeve <b>114</b> and body <b>14</b> are crimped together at crimped area <b>140</b> to set stroke length. In addition, the groove <b>64</b> and recessed portion <b>52</b> advantageously are provided with rounded edges <b>126</b> to help maintain the integrity of the seal <b>12</b> during reciprocation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, during reciprocation of the valve element <b>16</b> relative the recessed portion <b>52</b>, the first and second portions <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> of the seal <b>12</b>, respectively, maintain fluid tight seals within the recessed portion <b>52</b> and about the valve element <b>16</b>, thereby preventing liquid from leaking out of the liquid passage <b>30</b> past the flexible seal <b>12</b> and into the upper area <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, it should be understood by one of ordinary skill that any number of alternative dispenser bodies <b>14</b> may be used herein. For example, dispenser bodies <b>14</b> may include integrally formed heater blocks and/or be integrally formed with a manifold, or other similar assembly. In addition, the term “valve element” is used herein in a generic sense and is intended to encompass a wide range of movable members having a variety of shapes and contours.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in some detail, it is not the intention of the Applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art. The various features of the invention may be used alone or in numerous combinations depending on the needs and preferences of the user. This has been a description of the present invention, along with the preferred methods of practicing the present invention as currently known.</p>
