<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to power supply systems and more particularly to power supply systems having a plurality of power supply units, one of such units being provided for redundancy in the event of a power supply unit failure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As is known in the art, many electrical systems include a power supply system and more particularly to power supply systems having a plurality of power supply units, one of such units being provided for redundancy in the event of a power supply unit failure. Such power supply systems are sometimes referred to as N+1 power supply systems where N is the number of units used in normal operation and the “1” refers to the redundant power supply unit. Thus, N may be one or more than one.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is also known in the art, with an N+1 power supply systems it is difficult to detect a latent fault with either one of the power supply units or the cabling which connects a unit to a common power bus. More particularly, N+1 power supply systems typically have internal logic OR-ing diodes to interconnect the individual power supply units to the common power bus. If one of the N+1 power supply units fails it would be desirable to isolate the particular one of the N+1 power supply units that has failed. This is of particular use for standby voltage rails, which do not have any additional means of detecting or isolating failure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with the present invention, a system is provided for detecting a fault in a power supply having at least one power supply unit and a redundant power supply unit. The system includes a printed circuit board and a common voltage bus disposed on the printed circuit board. The system includes a plurality of diodes disposed on the printed circuit board having first electrodes connected to the common voltage supply bus and each of such diodes having second electrodes connected to a corresponding one of the at least one power supply unit and the redundant power supply unit. The plurality of diodes are connected to the common bus in a logic OR configuration. The system includes a controller, disposed on the printed circuit board, fed by a voltage at the second electrode of a corresponding one of the plurality of diodes and a reference voltage for determining whether the voltage at the second electrode of the corresponding one of the plurality of diodes is producing a proper predetermined voltage relative to the reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the second electrodes of the plurality of diodes are connected to first terminals of the printed circuit board. The first terminals are fed a first voltage produced by the corresponding one of the at least one power supply unit and the redundant power supply unit. The printed circuit board has a second terminal fed by a second voltage produced by the one of the at least one power supply unit and the redundant power supply unit. The system includes a DC-to-DC voltage converter disposed on the printed circuit, such converter being connected between the second terminal and the controller. The converter produces a second reference voltage for the controller. The controller compares the voltage at the second electrode of a corresponding one of the plurality of diodes with the first-mentioned reference voltage and in the event that such comparison indicates a fault condition, the controller compares the first-mentioned reference voltage with the second reference voltage.</p>

It is noted these second reference voltages V<sub>b</sub>-V<sub>g </sub>are known tested voltages because the +12 Volts has been tested internally, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Likewise, the converter <b>80</b>B is connected between the third common bus <b>62</b> to feed the other one of the plurality of controllers <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B, here controller <b>26</b>B, the voltage produced on the third common bus <b>62</b> after converting said voltage to a plurality of second reference voltages, here voltages V′<sub>b</sub>-V′<sub>g</sub>.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">By adding external monitoring points +5V_PSU_A and +5V_PSU_B at the second electrodes <b>24</b> of the diodes <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, respectively, the controllers <b>26</b>A, <b>6</b>B (e.g., microcontrollers programmed to perform the process to be described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), compares the voltages measured at +5V_PSU_A and +5V_PSU_B, with a known good references (V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>and V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>B</sub>, respectively). In the event that comparing +5V_PSU_A against V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>indicates a fault condition, the controller <b>26</b>A checks V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>against other known voltages on the board (V<sub>b </sub>through V<sub>g</sub>). If, as a result of the comparison, the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>appears correct as compared with at least one of the known voltages on the board (V<sub>b </sub>through V<sub>g</sub>), the controller <b>26</b>A deduces that V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>is correct and +5V_PSU_A is faulty. If, as a result of the comparison, the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>does not appear correct as compared with at least one of the known voltages on the board (V<sub>b </sub>through V<sub>g</sub>), the controller <b>26</b>A deduces that V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>is incorrect and +5V_PSU_A is good.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Likewise, in the event that comparing +5V_PSU_B against V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>B </sub>indicates a fault condition, the controllers <b>26</b>B checks V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>B </sub>against other known voltages on the board (V′<sub>b </sub>through V′<sub>g</sub>). If at least one other voltage appears correct, the controller <b>26</b>B deduces that V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>B </sub>is correct and +5V_PSU_B is faulty.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The output of the converters <b>80</b>A and <b>80</b>B are wired in a logic OR configuration and are fed to loads LOAD_b to LOAD_g, respectively. The output voltage on the first-mentioned common bus <b>18</b> is fed to a LOAD, as indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and considering one of the controllers, here controller <b>26</b>A and recognizing that controller <b>26</b>B operates in like manner, the process compares the voltage at the second electrode <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), i.e., the voltage +5_PSU_A with the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A</sub>, Step <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">If in Step <b>202</b> the voltage +5_PSU_A is equal to the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>to within a tolerance of ΔV<sub>a</sub>, the voltage +5_PSU_A is considered valid, Step <b>204</b>, and the process returns to Step <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">On the other hand, if in Step <b>202</b> the voltage +5_PSU_A is not equal to the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>to within a tolerance of ΔV<sub>a</sub>, the process compares the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>with each of the reference voltages V<sub>b </sub>through V<sub>g</sub>, Step <b>206</b>. If, in Step <b>210</b>, at least one of these V<sub>b </sub>through V<sub>g </sub>compares properly with the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A</sub>, the voltage +5_PSU_A is considered invalid, Step <b>214</b>, and such condition is reported by a communication link to a remote station, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">On the other hand, if in Step <b>202</b> the voltage +5_PSU_A is not equal to the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A </sub>to within a tolerance of ΔV<sub>a</sub>, and in Step <b>210</b> the process determines that none of the voltages V<sub>b </sub>through V<sub>g </sub>compares properly with the reference voltage V<sub>REF</sub><sub><sub2>—</sub2></sub><sub>A</sub>, the process determines that the voltage Vref_A is considered invalid in Step <b>215</b> and the process returns to Step <b>200</b>.</p>
