<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Cooling apparatuses and methods are provided for cooling an assembly including a planar support structure supporting multiple electronics components. The cooling apparatus includes: multiple discrete cold plates, each having a coolant inlet, coolant outlet and at least one coolant carrying channel disposed therebetween; and a manifold for distributing coolant to and exhausting coolant from the cold plates. The cooling apparatus also includes multiple flexible hoses connecting the coolant inlets of the cold plates to the manifold, as well as the coolant outlets to the manifold, with each hose segment being disposed between a respective cold plate and the manifold. A biasing mechanism biases the cold plates away from the manifold and towards the electronics components, and at least one fastener secures the manifold to the support structure, compressing the biasing mechanism, and thereby forcing the parallel coupled cold plates towards their respective electronics components to ensure good thermal interface.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to cooling apparatuses and methods for removing heat generated by electronics components (e.g., devices, modules, systems, etc.) and to methods of constructing such cooling apparatuses. More particularly, the present invention relates to cooling apparatuses and methods for extracting heat from heat generating electronics components of an electronics assembly, such as a plurality of multichip and/or single-chip modules disposed on a support structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is known, operating electronic devices produce heat. This heat should be removed from the devices in order to maintain device junction temperatures within desirable limits. Failure to remove the heat thus produced results in increased device temperatures, potentially leading to thermal runaway conditions. Several trends in the electronics industry have combined to increase the importance of thermal management, including heat removal for electronic devices, including technologies where thermal management has traditionally been less of a concern, such as CMOS. In particular, the need for faster and more densely packed circuits has had a direct impact on the importance of thermal management. First, power dissipation, and therefore heat production, increases as device operating frequencies increase. Second, increased operating frequencies may be possible at lower device junction temperatures. Further, as more and more devices are packed onto a single chip, power density (Watts/cm<sup>2</sup>) increases, resulting in the need to remove more heat from a given size chip or module. Additionally, a common packaging configuration for many large computer systems today is a multi-drawer rack, with each drawer containing one or more processor modules along with associated electronics, such as memory, power and hard drive devices. These drawers are removable units so that in the event of failure of an individual drawer, the drawer may be removed and replaced in the field. A problem with this configuration is the increase in heat flux at the electronics drawer level. The above-noted trends have combined to create applications where it is no longer desirable to remove heat from modern devices solely by traditional air cooling methods, such as by using traditional air cooled heat sinks. These trends are likely to continue, furthering the need for alternatives to traditional air cooling methods.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One approach to avoiding the limitations of traditional air cooling is to use a cooling liquid. As is known, different liquids provide different cooling capabilities. In particular, liquids such as refrigerants or other dielectric fluids (e.g., fluorocarbon fluid) exhibit relatively poor thermal conductivity and specific heat properties, i.e., when compared to liquids such as water or other aqueous fluids. Dielectric liquids have an advantage, however, in that they may be placed in direct physical contact with electronic devices and interconnects without adverse affects such as corrosion or electrical short circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other cooling liquids, such as water or other aqueous fluids, exhibit superior thermal conductivity and specific heat compared to dielectric liquids. Water-based coolants, however, must be kept from physical contact with electronics components and interconnects, since corrosion and electrical short circuit problems are likely to result from contact. Various methods have been disclosed for using water-based coolants, while providing physical separation between the coolant and the electronics components. For example, a cold plate can be employed wherein coolant passes through channels within the cold plate, and the plate is physically coupled to the one or more electronics components, thereby facilitating the extraction of heat therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Notwithstanding the above, there remains a large and significant need to provide further enhanced cooling apparatuses and methods of fabrication thereof for facilitating cooling of electronic assemblies such as electronic modules disposed on a common support structure, e.g., in a multi-drawer electronics rack.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, “electronics subsystem” comprises any housing, compartment, drawer, blade, etc., containing one or more heat generating components of a computer system or other electronics system requiring cooling. The term “electronics rack” includes any frame, rack, blade server system, etc., having a heat generating component of a computer system or electronics system, and may be, for example, a stand alone computer processor having high, mid or low end processing capability. In one embodiment, an electronics rack may comprise multiple electronics subsystems, each having one or more heat generating electronics components requiring cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each “heat generating electronics component” may comprise a multichip electronics module, a single-chip electronics module, one or more unpackaged integrated circuit die, etc. A “support structure” for the electronics assembly is in one embodiment a substantially planar structure, which may comprise a board, a stiffener, a substrate, etc. A “biasing mechanism” refers to any biasing structure, such as one or more springs, leafs, etc., with the four spring arrangement per cold plate being illustrated in the examples provided herein by way of example only.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One example of coolant for a cooling apparatus in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is water. However, the concepts disclosed herein are readily adapted to use with other types of coolant. For example, one or more of the coolants may comprise a brine, a fluorocarbon liquid, a liquid metal, or other similar coolant, or a refrigerant, while still maintaining the advantages and unique features of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As noted briefly above, power levels in computer equipment such as processors are rising to a level beyond simple air cooling capacity. The electronics components might thus be water cooled. Heat dissipated by a processor can be transferred to water via a water cooled cold plate. Facility water typically available at customer locations (i.e., data centers) is often not suitable for use in cold plates. First, condensation formation is a concern as the temperature of the data center water, ranging from 7° C. to 15° C., is far below the room dew point (typically 17-28° C.). Second, the relatively poor quality of the facility water (in chemistry, cleanliness, etc.) impacts system reliability. It is therefore desirable to utilize a water cooling/conditioning unit that circulates higher quality water to/from the electronics subsystems and rejects the heat to the data center water. As used herein, “facility water” or “facility coolant” refers to, in one example, this data center water or coolant, while “system coolant” refers to cooled/conditioned coolant circulating between a coolant distribution unit and the electronics subsystems to be cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts one embodiment of a coolant distribution unit <b>100</b> for a computer room. The coolant distribution unit is conventionally a relatively large unit comparable in size to an electronics frame. Within the cooling unit <b>100</b> is a power/control element <b>112</b>, a reservoir/expansion tank <b>113</b>, a heat exchanger <b>114</b>, a pump <b>115</b> (often accompanied by a redundant second pump), facility water (or site or customer service water or coolant) inlet <b>116</b> and outlet <b>117</b> supply pipes, a supply manifold <b>118</b> directing water to the electronics frames <b>130</b> via couplings <b>120</b> and lines <b>122</b>, and a return manifold <b>119</b> directing water from the electronics frames <b>130</b>, via lines <b>123</b> and couplings <b>121</b>. Each electronics rack includes multiple electronics drawers or multiple electronics subsystems <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates operation of the cooling system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein a liquid cooled cold plate <b>155</b> is shown coupled to an electronic device <b>150</b> of electronics drawer <b>135</b> within electronics rack <b>130</b>. Heat is removed from electronic device <b>150</b> via the system coolant pumped via pump <b>115</b> through cold plate <b>155</b> within the system coolant loop defined by heat exchanger <b>114</b> of coolant distribution unit <b>100</b>, lines <b>122</b>, <b>123</b> and cold plate <b>155</b>. The system coolant loop and coolant distribution unit are designed to provide coolant of a controlled temperature and pressure, as well as controlled chemistry and cleanliness to the electronics. Furthermore, the system coolant is physically separate from the less controlled facility coolant in lines <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> to which heat is ultimately transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As noted, as the demand for increased computing cycles per unit time and volume increases, systems are driven to more compact and highly parallel processor arrangements. One common design is a planar electronic assembly comprising multiple electronics components, such as single-chip modules and/or multichip modules. As these modules increase in power, liquid coolant becomes more and more necessary to dissipate the heat generated by the modules. One cooling approach would be a series-flow arrangement through modules of a planar package (i.e., electronics assembly) while coolant in other planar packages, sometimes referred to in the art as nodes, might flow in parallel with one another. A common inlet manifold could feed all nodes and a common return manifold might handle coolant return, with separate hoses connecting a first series cold plate to the manifold, and then to the next cold plate, etc., until finally a last series cold plate is connected to the return manifold, all in parallel with the other nodes in the system. The drawbacks of such a solution include the existence of many hoses for each electronics assembly (node), causing clutter and increasing the possibility of leaks, the high pressure requirements due to the serial flow arrangement on each node, the large coolant temperature rise when passing serially through components of a node, resulting in relatively low thermal performance for the last serial cold plate, and the maintenance complexity due to the clutter of hoses.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention addresses these drawbacks of a serial solution by achieving highly parallel flow at the node level without increasing the amount of hoses required to the node, thereby resulting in a lower overall pressure requirement and ensuring that the thermal performance across all modules in an electronics assembly (e.g., node) is reasonably uniform. Further, the present invention allows for module misorientation, e.g., different component heights and/or angular orientations, while still reducing hose clutter and allowing for easier maintenance than a serial solution such as outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Advantageously, the present invention employs rigid cold plates as heat transfer structures with high thermal efficiency, along with a common distribution manifold to permit simplified removal/maintenance of the cooling apparatus from the electronics assembly. Within each node, the rigid cold plates are flexibly coupled to the common manifold, thereby allowing the cold plates to achieve good thermal contact with the respective electronics components, notwithstanding that one or more dimensions or orientations of the components may vary. In one embodiment, each electronics component is cooled via a single associated cold plate, and each cold plate is fed coolant via a single flexible inlet hose and exhausts coolant via a single flexible outlet hose connection to the common manifold. The cooling apparatus further includes a biasing mechanism, such as a system of springs, to allow compliance of the cold plates. The cooling apparatus can be scaled to any number of electronics components (e.g., processor modules) in an electronics assembly, and is designed to conform to differences in height and orientation among the electronics components through the use of the flexible hoses and biasing mechanism(s) disposed between the manifold and the cold plates. Desirable height and contact interface pressures can be achieved for all the electronics components in a package regardless of height and orientation variations of the individual components, e.g., by adjusting the size of the biasing springs and flexible hoses coupling each cold plate to the manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> depict one example of a cooled electronics system comprising cooling apparatus <b>300</b> coupled to an electronics assembly <b>310</b> for facilitating cooling thereof, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. As shown, cooling apparatus <b>300</b> includes multiple discrete and rigid cold plates <b>320</b>, each of which couples to a respective electronics component <b>314</b> disposed on a support structure <b>312</b>. Each electronics component is a heat generating component, and as noted, may comprise a multichip module, single-chip module, or one or more unpackaged circuit die, etc., while structure <b>312</b> may comprise a planar board, stiffener or other rigid substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Cold plates <b>320</b> are rigid structures to facilitate thermal interface of each forced cold plate and its respective electronics component. Coolant is fed to cold plates <b>320</b> in parallel from a common, rigid manifold <b>330</b> through compliant flexible hoses <b>340</b>. In this example, manifold <b>330</b> includes a rigid lower manifold portion <b>332</b> and a rigid upper manifold portion <b>334</b>, between which appropriate inlet and outlet plenums are defined, as described further below. A biasing mechanism, such as a plurality of springs <b>350</b>, is disposed between the multiple cold plates <b>320</b> and the manifold <b>330</b> to bias the cold plates away from the manifold, and towards the electronics components <b>314</b>, thereby ensuring good thermal interface between the cold plates and the electronics components, notwithstanding variation in height or angular orientation of the components relative to their support structure.</p>

As noted, cooling apparatus <b>300</b> includes: multiple cold plates <b>320</b>, each of which has at least one coolant inlet, at least one coolant outlet and at least one coolant channel for the flow of coolant therethrough; compliant flexible hoses <b>340</b>, which provide a fluid-tight connection between the common manifold and the individual cold plates <b>320</b> while maintaining freedom of motion for the cold plates; and multiple springs <b>350</b>, with four springs per cold plate being shown in this embodiment. Springs <b>350</b> are sized to provide a desired force against cold plates <b>320</b> to ensure a favorable thermal contact between each cold plate and its respective electronics component, as well as provide cold plate compliance which allows the components to vary in height and/or orientation within the electronics assembly. The common distribution manifold again includes, in this embodiment, lower manifold portion <b>332</b> and upper manifold portion <b>334</b> which are configured to seal together and define between them at least one inlet plenum and at least one outlet plenum.

A biasing mechanism (such as springs <b>450</b>) is coupled to the cold plates and biases each cold plate away from the manifold so that when fasteners <b>460</b> secure the cooling apparatus to the electronics assembly <b>410</b>, the biasing mechanism compresses and provides a controlled pressure against each cold plate to force each cold plate into good thermal coupling with its respective electronics component of the electronics assembly <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> depicts in detail one embodiment of the inlet and outlet plenums defined between the lower and upper manifold portions. In this embodiment, each cold plate is assumed to have a single coolant inlet and a single coolant outlet, and the cold plates are assumed to be in the same orientation with respect to the electronics assembly. This allows a system of passages to be designed in the manifold that can accommodate any number of electronics components in a symmetric pattern (2×2, 3×3, 4×4, etc.) by utilizing a unit cell approach. Note that a unit cell comprising the manifold section over one cold plate is adjacent to its mirror image, mirrored about the intersecting line between the cells. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, a single inlet plenum <b>431</b> is defined, along with a single outlet plenum <b>433</b>. A single coolant inlet <b>435</b> feeds coolant to inlet plenum <b>431</b>, which distributes the coolant in parallel to the cold plates through respective cold plate coolant inlets <b>441</b> and flexible hoses in fluid communication with the inlet plenum. A single coolant outlet <b>437</b> exhausts coolant from the outlet plenum <b>433</b>, which receives coolant via respective cold plate coolant outlets <b>442</b> and flexible hoses in fluid communication with the outlet plenum.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As a further enhancement to the cooling apparatuses described above, a cooling apparatus can be constructed having two or more independent and parallel cooling loops, e.g., by providing multiple inlet and outlet plenums in the common manifold, multiple inlet and outlet hoses to each cold plate, and multiple coolant channels within each cold plate. One embodiment of such a dual loop cooling apparatus is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5E</figref>. The two independent coolant loops in this embodiment are distributed in the manifold, run to each cold plate in parallel, and remain separated throughout the respective cold plates. These dual coolant loops, referred to herein as a primary coolant loop and a redundant, secondary coolant loop, can be connected to separate independent conditioned water sources, and each cold plate could be designed to allow for a doubling of coolant flow rate in one loop if the other loop were to fail.</p>

Cooling apparatus <b>500</b> includes multiple liquid cooled cold plates <b>520</b>, each located and configured to couple to a respective electronics component of the electronics assembly. Coolant is provided in parallel to the cold plates <b>520</b> via a manifold <b>530</b>, and multiple flexible coolant tubes <b>540</b>, with each cold plate having two coolant inlet and two coolant outlet tubes <b>540</b>. Note that in this embodiment, tubes <b>540</b> are preferably compliant flexible tubes which are looped between the manifold and the respective cold plate in order to allow for sufficient cold plate movement to accommodate variations in the electronics components to be cooled. In an alternate embodiment, the compliant looped tubes <b>540</b> could be replaced with a compliant compressible hose such as depicted with the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-4D</figref>. The phrase “hose segment” employed in the attached claims is intended to encompass either implementation, as well as other suitable hose/tube configurations. Manifold <b>530</b> includes a lower manifold <b>532</b>, an upper manifold <b>534</b>, and a cover plate <b>570</b>. A biasing mechanism, such as springs <b>550</b>, is disposed between the multiple cold plates <b>520</b> and the manifold <b>530</b> to bias the cold plates away from the manifold, and towards the electronics components to be cooled.</p>

Thus, external to the cooling apparatus, only four fluid connections (not shown) are required to operate the cooling apparatus in the dual loop configuration, which can significantly reduce the number of hoses otherwise required in an electronics rack. For example, if parallel cold plates were conventionally individually piped to a manifold, a 2×2 array would require 16 hoses, a 3×3 array would require 36 hoses, and a 4×4 array would require 64 hoses, etc. In addition to freeing space within the electronics rack, the dual loop cooling apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5E</figref> further allows compliance of the cold plates for both orientation and height differences among the electronics components, thereby allowing for optimum thermal contact between the components and the cold plates.</p>

Further, each cold plate may comprise a micro-scaled cooling structure, with a characteristic dimension of 200 microns or less.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Those skilled in the art will note from the above discussion, that provided herein are various cooling apparatuses and methods of fabrication which employ a common distribution manifold and multiple cold plates in a parallel coolant flow path configuration through the cold plates. These cooling apparatuses allow for planar and angular misorientation of the individual electronics components to be cooled with respect to their support structure, and have in one embodiment, a single inlet and a single outlet per coolant loop through the cooling apparatus, thereby minimizing hoses to be routed through the next higher level of packaging. In the dual loop cooling apparatus configuration, two independent and parallel coolant paths are established through the cooling apparatus, employing only two inlets and two outlets to the common distribution manifold, regardless of the number of cold plates.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, provision of compliant hoses/tubes and a biasing mechanism(s) ensures control of the contact pressure between the cold plates and their respective electronics components. As a further enhancement, the size and coolant carrying capability of the hoses/tubes and the various cold plates can differ across the cold plates in order to customize the cooling capacity of the individual cold plates; for example, to provide higher coolant flow through capacity for higher heat generating components, and lower coolant flow through capacity for lower heat generating components of the electronics assembly. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various techniques can be employed to modify the amount of coolant flow through the different cold plates.</p>
