<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a microstrip antenna for use on a weapons system to transmit telemetry data. More specifically, the present invention relates to a cylindrical shaped microstrip antenna array which operates in the X-band frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum and which is adapted for use on a 14-inch diameter weapons system such as a missile.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A microstrip antenna operates by resonating at a frequency. The conventional design uses printed circuit techniques to put a printed copper patch on the top of a layer of dielectric with a ground plane on the bottom of the dielectric. The frequency that the microstrip antenna operates at is approximately a half-wavelength in the microstrip medium of dielectric below the patch and air above the patch.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is currently a need to produce a quasi omni-directional radiation pattern from a conformal wrap-around microstrip antenna with a 14-inch maximum diameter and 5-inch maximum length. The antenna is to be used on a weapons system or projectile such as a missile. The required frequency of operation for the antenna is 7900 to 8100 MHz telemetry frequency band which is the X-Band frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention overcomes some of the disadvantages of the past including those mentioned above in that it comprises a highly effective and efficient microstrip antenna designed to transmit telemetry data from a missile/projectile at the X-Band frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The X-Band microstrip antenna comprising the present invention is configured to wrap around the projectile's body without interfering with the aerodynamic design of the projectile.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The X-Band microstrip antenna is designed to transmit telemetry data and is adapted for use on a fourteen inch diameter projectile. The microstrip antenna operates at the 7900 to 8100 MHz X-Band frequency band. Sixteen copper plated microstrip antenna elements equally spaced around the projectile provide for linear polarization and a quasi-omni directional radiation pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The X-Band microstrip antenna includes a feed network which consist of equal amplitude and phase power dividers. The feed network for the X-Band microstrip antenna drives the antenna elements with equal amplitude and equal phase.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, there is shown a X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b> which is a wrap around conformal antenna designed for a small projectile having a maximum diameter of fourteen inches. The maximum width W for antenna <b>10</b> is five inches. Antenna <b>10</b> operates at the X-Band frequency which is 7900 MHz to 8100 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B, the top layer of the circuit printed circuit board <b>12</b> for microstrip antenna <b>10</b> includes sixteen half-wavelength antenna elements <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. Equally dividing the circumference of microstrip antenna <b>10</b> into sixteen parts in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and placing a half-wavelength microstrip antenna element <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> in each part provides the required quasi-omni direction radiation pattern for antenna <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, there is also a three sided gap <b>50</b> formed around the top and two sides of the sixteen antenna elements <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> of X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b>. The three sided gap <b>50</b> exposes the top surface of the dielectric substrate for circuit board <b>12</b>. The X-Band microstrip antenna's electric field is confined primarily to the three sided gap <b>50</b> around each of the antenna elements <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> which is substantial different than a conventional microstrip copper antenna element where the electric field extends well beyond the antenna element.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3</figref>, the feed network <b>52</b> for the antenna elements of X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b> is a located on the bottom layer of the circuit board <b>12</b> for the X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b>. The signal input <b>54</b> for each of the antenna elements <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> is located at the center of each antenna element. The configuration of feed network <b>52</b>, which includes a main transmission line <b>57</b> and a plurality of branch transmission lines <b>59</b>, insures that the feed network <b>52</b> operates as an equal amplitude, equal phase power divider providing for equal distribution of RF signals with respect to the sixteen antenna elements <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> in both amplitude and phase. The feed network <b>52</b> matches a 50 ohm input impedance to the feed networks signal input <b>56</b> to the missile's on board electronics and computer. The feed networks signal input <b>56</b> is centrally located on bottom layer of circuit board <b>12</b>. The polarization of X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b> is linear polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is representative of a typical VSWR measurement (plot <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) for the X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b>. Plot <b>80</b> shows a frequency bandwidth from 7.6 GHz to about 8.4 GHZ which greatly exceeds the 7900 to 8100 MHz requirement for antenna <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Copper plating (designated generally by reference numeral <b>58</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and reference numeral <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) surrounds each of the antenna elements on the top layer of circuit board <b>12</b> and the feed network <b>52</b> on the bottom layer of circuit board <b>12</b> to reduce radiation from the feed network <b>52</b> and closely control the radiation pattern from the antenna elements.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, X-Band antenna <b>10</b> includes three printed circuit boards arranged as a stack. The outside or cover board is a protective layer having the same dimensions as circuit board <b>12</b>. The outside layer, which has a thickness of 0.062 inches, is fabricated from Rogers Corporation RT/5870 commercially available from Rogers Corporation of Rogers, Connecticut. The middle layer printed circuit board in the stack is circuit board <b>12</b> and the inside layer printed circuit board for antenna <b>10</b> is the ground printed circuit board <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). Circuit board <b>12</b> and ground board <b>62</b> are each fabricated from Rogers Corporation Duroid RT/6002 which has a 0.600 inch thickness clad with one ounce copper. The dielectric material selected for boards <b>12</b> and <b>62</b> was used because of the dielectric materials extremely stable properties with large temperature variations. X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b> utilizes two dielectric layers, circuit board <b>12</b> and ground board <b>62</b>, because a board thickness in the board in excess of 0.060 inches for this dielectric material will cause the material to crack when bent in the configuration required by antenna <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The top layer of the ground printed circuit board <b>62</b> is copper plating and is identical to the bottom layer of circuit board <b>12</b> except the feed network has been removed exposing the dielectric material of circuit board <b>62</b>. The bottom layer of circuit board <b>12</b> is solid copper with a clearance hole <b>64</b> for the signal input to feed network <b>52</b> and antenna elements.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the X-Band antenna <b>10</b> is assembled the upper portion <b>66</b> and the lower portion <b>68</b> of the ground board are removed. This leaves only the middle portion <b>70</b> of the ground board <b>62</b> when the antenna is fully assembled. The circuit board <b>12</b> and cover board also have their upper and lower portions removed when the antenna is fully assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the printed circuit boards of X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b> is gold plated to protect the printed circuit boards from environmental conditions and high bonding temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is representative of a typical VSWR measurement (plot <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) for the X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b>. Plot <b>80</b> shows a frequency bandwidth from 7.6 GHz to about 8.4 GHZ which greatly exceeds the 7900 to 8100 MHz requirement for X-Band microstrip antenna <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">From the foregoing, it is readily apparent that the present invention comprises a new, unique, and exceedingly useful X-Band microstrip antenna adapted for use on 14 inch diameter projectiles, which constitutes a considerable improvement over the known prior art. Many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
