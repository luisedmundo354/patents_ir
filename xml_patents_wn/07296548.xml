<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to hydraulic valve lifters for use with internal combustion engines, and, more particularly, to a lifter-based device which accomplishes cylinder deactivation in push-rod engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automobile emissions are said to be the largest contributor to pollution in numerous cities across the country. Automobiles emit hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as a result of the combustion process. The Clean Air Act of 1970 and the 1990 Clean Air Act set national goals of clean and healthy air for all and established responsibilities for industry to reduce emissions from vehicles and other pollution sources. Standards set by the 1990 law limit automobile emissions to 0.25 grams per mile (gpm) non-methane hydrocarbons and 0.4 gpm nitrogen oxides. The standards are predicted to be further reduced by half in the year 2004. It is expected that automobiles will continue to be powered by internal combustion engines for decades to come. As the world population continues to grow, and standards of living continue to rise, there will be an even greater demand for automobiles. This demand is predicted to be especially great in developing countries. The increasing number of automobiles is likely to cause a proportionate increase in pollution. The major challenge facing automobile manufacturers is to reduce undesirable and harmful emissions by improving fuel economy, thereby assuring the increased number of automobiles has a minimal impact on the environment. One method by which automobile manufacturers have attempted to improve fuel economy and reduce undesirable emissions is cylinder deactivation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cylinder deactivation is the deactivation of the intake and/or exhaust valves of a cylinder or cylinders during at least a portion of the combustion process, and is a proven method by which fuel economy can be improved. In effect, cylinder deactivation reduces the number of engine cylinders within which the combustion process is taking place. With fewer cylinders performing combustion, fuel efficiency is increased and the amount of pollutants emitted from the engine will be reduced. For example, in an eight-cylinder engine under certain operating conditions, four of the eight cylinders can be deactivated. Thus, combustion would be taking place in only four, rather than in all eight, cylinders. Cylinder deactivation is effective, for example, during part-load conditions when full engine power is not required for smooth and efficient engine operation. In vehicles having large displacement push rod engines, studies have shown that cylinder deactivation can improve fuel economy by as much as fifteen percent.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The reliability and performance of the large displacement push rod engines was proven early in the history of the automobile. The basic designs of the large displacement push rod engines in use today have remained virtually unchanged for a period of over thirty years, due in part to the popularity of such engines, the reluctance of the consumer to accept changes in engines, and the tremendous cost in designing, tooling, and testing such engines. Conventional methods of achieving cylinder deactivation, however, are not particularly suited to large displacement push rod engines. These conventional methods typically require the addition of components which do not fit within the space occupied by existing valve train components. Thus, the conventional methods of achieving cylinder deactivation typically necessitate major design changes in such engines.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, what is needed in the art is a device which enables cylinder deactivation in large displacement push rod engines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, what is needed in the art is a device which enables cylinder deactivation in large displacement push rod engines and is designed to fit within existing space occupied by conventional drive train components, thereby avoiding the need to redesign such engines.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, what is needed in the art is a device which enables cylinder deactivation in large displacement push rod engines without sacrificing the size of the hydraulic element.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a deactivation hydraulic valve lifter for use with push rod internal combustion engines. The lifter can be selectively deactivated such that a valve associated with the lifter is not operated, thereby selectively deactivating the engine cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention comprises, in one form thereof, a deactivation hydraulic valve lifter including an elongate lifter body having a substantially cylindrical inner wall. The inner wall defines at least one annular pin chamber therein. The lifter body has a lower end configured for engaging a cam of an engine. An elongate pin housing includes a substantially cylindrical pin housing wall and pin housing body. Preferably, the pin housing wall includes an inner surface and an outer surface. A radially directed pin bore extends through the pin housing bottom. The pin housing is concentrically disposed within the inner wall of the lifter body such that the outer surface of the pin housing wall is adjacent to at least a portion of the inner wall of the lifter body. Preferably, a plunger having a substantially cylindrical plunger wall with an inner surface and an outer surface is concentrically disposed within the pin housing such that the outer surface of the plunger wall is adjacent to at least a portion of the inner surface of the pin housing wall. A deactivation pin assembly is disposed within the pin bore and includes two pin members. The pin members are biased radially outward relative to each other. A portion of each pin member is disposed within the annular pin chamber to thereby couple the lifter body to the pin housing. The pin members are configured for moving toward each other when the pin chamber is pressurized, thereby retracting the pin members from within the annular pin chamber and decoupling the lifter body from the pin housing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An advantage of the present invention is that it is received within standard-sized engine bores which accommodate conventional hydraulic valve lifters.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another advantage of the present invention is that the deactivation pin assembly includes two pin members, thereby increasing the rigidity, strength, and operating range of the deactivation hydraulic valve lifter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet another advantage of the present invention is that no orientation of the pin housing relative to the lifter body is required.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A still further advantage of the present invention is that the pin housing is free to rotate relative to the lifter body, thereby evenly distributing wear on the annular pin chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An even further advantage of the present invention is that an external lost motion spring permits the use of a larger sized hydraulic element and operation under higher engine oil pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Lastly, an advantage of the present invention is that lash can be robustly and accurately set to compensate for manufacturing tolerances.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to the drawings and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown one embodiment of a deactivation roller hydraulic valve lifter <b>10</b> of the present invention. Deactivation roller hydraulic valve lifter (DRHVL) <b>10</b> includes roller <b>12</b>, lifter body <b>14</b>, deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b>, plunger assembly <b>18</b>, pin housing <b>20</b>, pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b>, spring seat <b>23</b>, lost motion spring <b>24</b>, and spring tower <b>26</b>. As will be more particularly described hereinafter, plunger assembly <b>18</b> is disposed concentrically within pin housing <b>20</b> which, in turn, is disposed concentrically within lifter body <b>14</b>. Pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> is disposed concentrically within pin housing <b>20</b> above plunger assembly <b>18</b>. Roller <b>12</b> is associated with lifter body <b>14</b>. Roller <b>12</b> rides on the cam of an internal combustion engine and is displaced vertically thereby. Roller <b>12</b> translates the rotary motion of the cam to vertical motion of lifter body <b>14</b>. Deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> normally engages lifter body <b>14</b>, thereby transferring the vertical reciprocation of lifter body <b>14</b> to pin housing <b>20</b> and, in turn, to plunger assembly <b>18</b> and pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b>. In this engaged position, the vertical reciprocation of DRHVL <b>10</b> opens and closes a valve of the internal combustion engine. Deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> disengages to decouple lifter body <b>14</b> from pin housing <b>20</b> and, in turn, decouples plunger assembly <b>18</b> and pin housing <b>20</b> from the vertical reciprocation of lifter body <b>14</b>. Thus, when deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is in the disengaged position, only lifter body <b>14</b> undergoes vertical reciprocation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Roller <b>12</b> is of conventional construction, having the shape of a hollow cylindrical member within which bearings <b>28</b> are disposed and retained. Roller <b>12</b> is disposed within a first end <b>15</b> of lifter body <b>14</b>. Shaft <b>30</b> passes through roller <b>12</b> such that bearings <b>28</b> surround shaft <b>30</b>, bearings <b>28</b> being disposed intermediate shaft <b>30</b> and the inside surface of roller <b>12</b>. Shaft <b>30</b> is attached by, for example, staking to lifter body <b>14</b>. Lifter body <b>14</b> includes on its outside surface anti-rotation flats (not shown) which are aligned with anti-rotation flats on an interior surface of a conventional anti-rotation guide (not shown) within which lifter body <b>14</b> of DRHVL <b>10</b> is inserted. This assembly is placed in the lifter bore of push-rod type engine <b>31</b>. Roller <b>12</b> rides on the cam (not shown) of push-rod type engine <b>31</b>. Roller <b>12</b> is constructed of, for example, hardened or hardenable steel or ceramic material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, lifter body <b>14</b> is an elongate cylindrical member dimensioned to be received within the space occupied by a standard roller hydraulic valve lifter. For example, lifter body <b>14</b> has a diameter of approximately 0.842 inches. Lifter body <b>14</b> has central axis A and includes cylindrical wall <b>32</b> having an inner surface <b>34</b> and a top end <b>33</b>. Inner surface <b>34</b> includes circumferential oil supply recess <b>34</b><i>a</i>. Diametrically opposed shaft orifices <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are defined in cylindrical wall <b>32</b> and include rim portions <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Rim portions <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>a </i>have a diameter that is slightly greater than the diameter of shaft orifices <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, respectively. Shaft <b>30</b> passes through shaft orifice <b>35</b>, extends diametrically through roller <b>12</b>, and at least partially into shaft orifice <b>36</b>. One end of shaft <b>30</b> is disposed in rim portion <b>35</b><i>a </i>and the other end of shaft <b>30</b> is disposed within rim portion <b>36</b><i>a</i>. The slightly larger diameter of rim portions <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>a </i>relative to shaft orifices <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> enables shaft <b>30</b> to be attached, such as, for example, by staking to lifter body <b>14</b>. Cylindrical wall <b>32</b> defines roller pocket <b>37</b> intermediate shaft orifices <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, which receives roller <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Cylindrical wall <b>32</b> defines control port <b>38</b> and oil port <b>40</b>. Inner surface <b>34</b> of cylindrical wall <b>32</b> defines annular pin chamber <b>42</b> therein. Preferably, annular pin chamber <b>42</b> is a contiguous chamber of a predetermined axial height, and extends around the entire circumference of inner surface <b>34</b> of cylindrical wall <b>32</b>. Control port <b>38</b> is defined by one opening which extends through cylindrical wall <b>32</b>, terminating at and opening into annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Thus, control port <b>38</b> provides a fluid passageway through cylindrical wall <b>32</b> and into annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Pressurized oil is injected through control port <b>38</b> into annular pin chamber <b>42</b> in order to retract deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> from within annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Oil port <b>40</b> passes through cylindrical wall <b>32</b> and into oil supply recess <b>34</b><i>a</i>, thereby providing a passageway for lubricating oil to enter the interior of lifter body <b>14</b>. Lifter body <b>14</b> is constructed of, for example, hardened or hardenable steel.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> includes two pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> interconnected by and biased radially outward relative to lifter body <b>14</b> by pin spring <b>50</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each of pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are round pins having stepped flats <b>46</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>a </i>which are dimensioned to be received within annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. As will be described with more particularity hereinafter, a small gap G is provided between flats <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>a </i>and the lower edge of annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Gap G provides for clearance between flats <b>46</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>a </i>and the lower edge of annular pin chamber <b>42</b>, thereby allowing for free movement of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> into pin chamber <b>42</b>. Each of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> include at one end pin faces <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>, respectively, and define pin bores <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively, at each opposite end. Each of pin bores <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> receive a corresponding end of pin spring <b>50</b>. In its normal or default position, pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> of deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> are biased radially outward by pin spring <b>50</b> such that at least a portion of each pin member <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> is disposed within annular pin chamber <b>42</b> of lifter body <b>14</b>. Preferably, pin faces <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> have a radius of curvature that corresponds to the curvature of inner surface <b>34</b> of cylindrical wall <b>32</b>. Thus, line contact is provided between pin faces <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> and the inner surface of pin chamber <b>42</b> upon initial engagement of pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> within pin chamber <b>42</b>. Each of pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> include stop grooves <b>46</b><i>b </i>and <b>48</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Stop grooves <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>extend a predetermined distance from the end of each pin member <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> that is opposite pin faces <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>, respectively. Pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are constructed of, for example, hardened or hardenable steel. Pin spring <b>50</b> is a coil spring constructed of, for example, music wire.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, preferably, plunger assembly <b>18</b> is disposed within pin housing <b>20</b> which, in turn, is disposed within lifter body <b>14</b>. Plunger assembly <b>18</b> includes plunger <b>60</b>, plunger ball <b>62</b>, plunger spring <b>64</b> and ball retainer <b>66</b>. Plunger <b>60</b> is a cup shaped member including a cylindrical side wall <b>68</b> and a plunger bottom <b>70</b>, and is slidably disposed concentrically within pin housing <b>20</b>. Plunger side wall <b>68</b>, bottom <b>70</b>, and pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> conjunctively define low-pressure chamber <b>72</b>. Plunger bottom <b>70</b> includes plunger orifice <b>74</b> and seat <b>76</b>. Plunger orifice <b>74</b> is circular in shape, having a predetermined diameter, and is concentric with plunger cylindrical side wall <b>68</b>. Seat <b>76</b> is a recessed area defined by plunger bottom <b>70</b>. Plunger <b>60</b> is constructed of, for example, hardenable or hardened steel. Plunger ball <b>62</b> is movably disposed within ball retainer <b>66</b>, which, in turn, is disposed within seat <b>76</b> adjacent plunger bottom <b>70</b>. Plunger spring <b>64</b> is a coil spring and is disposed between pin housing <b>20</b> and plunger assembly <b>18</b>. More particularly, plunger spring <b>64</b> is disposed between seat <b>76</b> of plunger bottom <b>70</b> and pin housing <b>20</b>, pressing ball retainer <b>66</b> against seat <b>76</b> of plunger bottom <b>70</b>. In that position, plunger ball <b>62</b> and ball retainer <b>66</b> conjunctively define a ball-type check valve. Plunger ball <b>62</b> is a spherical ball of a predetermined circumference such that plunger ball <b>62</b> is movable within ball retainer <b>66</b> toward and away from plunger orifice <b>74</b>, and seals plunger orifice <b>74</b> in a fluid tight manner. Plunger ball <b>62</b> is constructed of, for example, hardenable or hardened steel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Pin housing <b>20</b> includes cylindrical side wall <b>80</b>, having an inner surface <b>82</b>, outer surface <b>83</b>, and body portion <b>84</b>. Body portion <b>84</b> includes an inside surface <b>86</b> and an outside surface <b>88</b>. Inside surface <b>86</b> is in the form of a cylindrical indentation which is surrounded by ledge <b>92</b>. Pin housing body portion <b>84</b> defines a cylindrical deactivation pin bore <b>94</b> radially therethrough. Deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is disposed within deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>. Drain aperture <b>96</b> is also defined by body portion <b>84</b> and extends from deactivation pin bore <b>94</b> through to outer surface <b>88</b> of body portion <b>84</b>. Body portion <b>84</b> further defines two stop pin apertures <b>98</b> therein. Stop pin apertures <b>98</b> are parallel relative to each other and perpendicular relative to deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>. Stop pin apertures <b>98</b> extend through side wall <b>80</b> radially inward through body portion <b>84</b>, intersecting with and terminating in deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>. Inner surface <b>82</b> of side wall <b>80</b> defines a lower annular groove <b>104</b> proximate to and extending a predetermined distance above ledge <b>92</b>. Inner surface <b>82</b> also defines an intermediate annular groove <b>106</b> and an upper annular groove <b>108</b>. Pin housing <b>20</b> is free to rotate relative to lifter body <b>14</b>, and thus is not rotationally constrained within lifter body <b>14</b>. Pin housing <b>20</b> is constructed of, for example, hardenable or hardened steel.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">High pressure chamber <b>100</b> is conjunctively defined by bottom inner surface <b>86</b> of pin housing <b>20</b>, plunger bottom <b>70</b>, and the portion of inner surface <b>82</b> of cylindrical side wall <b>80</b> disposed therebetween. Plunger orifice <b>74</b> provides a passageway for the flow of fluid, such as, for example, oil, between high pressure chamber <b>100</b> and low pressure chamber <b>72</b>. The ball-type check valve formed by plunger ball <b>62</b> and ball retainer <b>66</b> selectively controls the ability of the fluid to flow through plunger orifice <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> includes cylindrical plug body <b>110</b> having a bottom surface <b>112</b> with a circumferential seat ring <b>114</b>. Opposite bottom surface <b>112</b> is a bowl shaped socket <b>118</b> surrounded by shelf <b>120</b>. Pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> is disposed concentrically within pin housing <b>20</b> such that bottom surface <b>112</b> is adjacent to the top of side wall <b>68</b> of plunger <b>60</b>. Plug body <b>110</b> defines pushrod seat orifice <b>122</b>, which is concentric with plug body <b>110</b> and extends axially from bottom surface <b>112</b> through to socket <b>118</b>. Insert <b>124</b> is inserted, such as, for example, by pressing, into pushrod seat orifice <b>122</b>. Insert <b>124</b> carries an insert orifice <b>126</b> having a very small diameter of, for example, about 0.1 to 0.4 mm. Insert <b>124</b> is disposed within pushrod seat orifice <b>122</b> such that pushrod seat orifice <b>122</b> and insert orifice <b>126</b> are concentric and in fluid communication with each other. Pushrod seat <b>22</b> and insert <b>124</b> are constructed of, for example, hardenable or hardened steel.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Spring seat <b>23</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is a ring-shaped member, having collar <b>130</b>, flange <b>132</b>, and orifice <b>134</b>. Collar <b>130</b> is disposed concentrically within lifter body <b>14</b> and adjacent to upper end <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of side wall <b>80</b> of pin housing <b>20</b>. Flange <b>132</b> extends radially from collar <b>130</b> such that flange <b>132</b> overlaps onto the top edge of cylindrical wall <b>32</b> of lifter body <b>14</b>. The height of gap G is determined by the dimensions of spring seat <b>23</b>. More particularly, the amount of length by which collar <b>130</b> extends axially into lifter body <b>14</b> determines the axial position of pin housing <b>20</b> relative to lifter body <b>14</b>, thereby determining the height of gap G.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Lost motion spring <b>24</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is a coil spring having one end <b>25</b><i>a </i>associated with spring seat <b>23</b> and the other end <b>25</b><i>b </i>associated with spring tower <b>26</b>. Lost motion spring <b>24</b> has a predetermined installed load which is selected to prevent hydraulic element pump up due to oil pressure in high pressure chamber <b>100</b> and due to the force exerted by plunger spring <b>64</b>. Lost motion spring <b>24</b> is constructed of, for example, hardenable or hardened steel.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Spring tower <b>26</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is an elongate cylindrical member having an outer wall <b>140</b>. A plurality of slots <b>142</b> are defined in outer wall <b>140</b>. Tabs <b>144</b> are formed along lower end <b>141</b> of outer wall <b>140</b>. A portion of outer wall <b>140</b> is concentrically disposed within pin housing <b>20</b>, adjacent to inner surface <b>82</b> of side wall <b>80</b>. Slots <b>142</b> enable spring tower <b>26</b> to be flexible enough to be pushed downward into pin housing <b>20</b> until each of tabs <b>144</b> are received within and snap into or engage upper annular groove <b>108</b> formed in side wall <b>80</b> of pin housing <b>20</b>. Spring tower <b>26</b> defines at its top end tower flange <b>146</b>, which is associated with the top end <b>25</b><i>a </i>of lost motion spring <b>26</b>. The lower end <b>141</b> of spring tower <b>26</b>, disposed within pin housing <b>20</b>, acts to limit the extended height of pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Stop pins <b>148</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, are, for example, pressed into stop pin apertures <b>98</b>, and extend a predetermined distance into deactivation pin bore <b>94</b> of pin housing <b>20</b>. Stop pins <b>148</b> are configured for restricting the inward retraction of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> of deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b>. A respective end of each stop pin <b>148</b> is disposed within a corresponding one of stop grooves <b>46</b><i>b </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>of pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, thereby preventing the undesirable condition of pin shuttle. Generally, pin shuttle occurs when a deactivation pin or pin member is radially displaced or pushed to one side or the other of a housing and is therefore unable to completely disengage from within an orifice or deactivation chamber. Further, stop pins <b>148</b> in conjunction with stop grooves <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>prevent excessive rotation of pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> relative to pin housing <b>20</b>. Stop pins <b>148</b> are constructed of, for example, hardenable or hardened steel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Spring tower <b>26</b> may be alternately configured, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to include a ring groove <b>150</b> and beveled edge <b>152</b> at lower end <b>141</b>′. In this embodiment, a resiliently deformable retaining ring <b>154</b> is disposed within upper annular groove <b>108</b> of pin housing <b>20</b>. In order to assemble DRHVL <b>10</b>, spring tower <b>26</b> is pushed downward into pin housing <b>20</b>. As spring tower <b>26</b> is inserted into pin housing <b>20</b> and pushed axially downward, beveled edge <b>152</b> of spring tower <b>26</b> contacts retaining ring <b>154</b> which is, in turn, displaced axially downward. This downward displacement of retaining ring <b>154</b> continues until retaining ring <b>154</b> contacts the bottom of upper annular groove <b>108</b>, which prevents further downward movement of retaining ring <b>154</b>. As downward motion of spring tower <b>26</b> continues, beveled edge <b>152</b> then acts to expand the resiliently deformable retaining ring <b>154</b>. Thus, retaining ring <b>154</b> is resiliently expanded by beveled bottom edge <b>152</b> as spring tower <b>26</b> is pushed downward into pin housing <b>20</b>. The expanded retaining ring <b>154</b> slides over spring tower <b>26</b> as spring tower <b>26</b> is pushed further downward into pin housing <b>20</b>. When ring groove <b>150</b> and retaining ring <b>154</b> are in axial alignment, retaining ring <b>154</b> snaps into ring groove <b>150</b>. As downward pressure upon spring tower <b>26</b> is removed, the action of lost motion spring <b>24</b> exerts an upward force on spring tower <b>26</b> until retaining ring <b>154</b> contacts the top edge of upper annular groove <b>108</b>. Thus, retaining ring <b>154</b> retains a portion of spring tower <b>26</b> within pin housing <b>20</b>, and determines the axial position of spring tower <b>26</b> relative to pin housing <b>20</b>. Spring tower <b>26</b> is constructed of, for example, hardenable or hardened steel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In use, roller <b>12</b> is associated with and rides on a lobe of an engine cam (not shown) in a conventional manner. Shaft <b>30</b> is attached within shaft orifices <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, such as, for example, by staking, to lifter body <b>14</b>. Thus, as the engine cam rotates, roller <b>12</b> follows the profile of an associated cam lobe and shaft <b>30</b> translate the rotary motion of the cam and cam lobe to linear, or vertical, motion of lifter body <b>14</b>. When deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is in its normal operating or default position, pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are biased radially outward by pin spring <b>50</b>. In this default position, pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> extend radially outward from within deactivation pin bore <b>94</b> and at least partially into diametrically opposed locations within annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is configured such that pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are biased radially outward to engage annular pin chamber <b>42</b> at diametrically opposed points. Annular pin chamber <b>42</b> is filled with fluid at all times during use, the fluid being at a low pressure when deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is in the normal or default position.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The use of two pin members results in a substantially rigid, strong, and durable assembly which can be used at higher engine speeds, or at higher engine revolutions per minute, than an assembly having one pin or non-diametrically opposed pins. The configuration of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> as round pin members with stepped flats <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>, respectively, increases the strength of the pin members and lowers the contact stress at the interface of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> and annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Annular pin chamber <b>42</b> is configured as a contiguous circumferential pin chamber. Thus, fixing the orientation of pin housing <b>20</b> relative to lifter body <b>14</b> is not necessary in order to ensure pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> will be radially aligned with contiguous annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> rotate with pin housing <b>20</b> and will therefore randomly engage annular pin chamber <b>42</b> at various points along the circumference of lifter body <b>14</b>. Thus, the rotation of pin housing <b>20</b> relative to lifter body <b>14</b> distributes the wear incurred by annular pin chamber <b>42</b> being repeatedly engaged and disengaged by pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> engaged within annular pin chamber <b>42</b> of lifter body <b>14</b>, vertical movement of lifter body <b>14</b> will result in vertical movement of pin housing <b>20</b>, plunger assembly <b>18</b>, and pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b>. Thus, lifter body <b>14</b>, plunger assembly <b>18</b>, pin housing <b>20</b>, and pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> are reciprocated as substantially one body when deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is in its default position. With pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> thus engaged, a push rod (not shown) seated in pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> will likewise undergo reciprocal vertical motion. Through valve train linkage (not shown) the reciprocal motion of a push rod associated with pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> will act to open and close a corresponding valve (not shown) of engine <b>31</b>. Fluid, such as, for example oil or hydraulic fluid, at a relatively low pressure fills annular pin chamber <b>42</b> while pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are engaged within annular pin chamber <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is taken out of its default position and placed into a deactivated state by the injection of a pressurized fluid, such as, for example oil or hydraulic fluid, through control port <b>38</b>. The injection of the pressurized fluid is selectively controlled by, for example, a control valve (not shown) or other suitable flow control device. The pressurized fluid is injected through control port <b>38</b> and into annular pin chamber <b>42</b> at a relatively high pressure to disengage the pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> from within annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Close tolerances between side wall <b>80</b> of pin housing <b>20</b> and inner surface <b>34</b> of cylindrical wall <b>32</b> of lifter body <b>14</b> act to retain the pressurized fluid within annular pin chamber <b>42</b>, thus providing a chamber within which the pressurized fluid flows. The pressurized fluid fills annular pin chamber <b>42</b> and exerts pressure on pin faces <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>. The pressure forces pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> radially inward, thereby compressing pin spring <b>50</b>. Pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are thus retracted from within annular pin chamber <b>42</b> and into deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>. The radially-inward movement of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> is limited by stop pins <b>148</b> which ride within stop grooves <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are configured with pin faces <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> having a radius of curvature which matches the radius of curvature of inner surface <b>34</b>, thereby providing a large active surface area against which the pressurized oil injected into annular pin chamber <b>42</b> acts to retract pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> from within annular pin chamber <b>42</b>. Pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are sized to be in close tolerance with deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>. However, some of the pressurized fluid injected into annular pin chamber <b>42</b> may push into the area of deactivation pin bore <b>94</b> between pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>. If the area of deactivation pin bore <b>94</b> between pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> were to fill with fluid, retraction of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> would become virtually impossible and a lock-up condition can result. Drain aperture <b>96</b> in pin housing <b>20</b> allows any of the fluid injected into annular pin chamber <b>42</b> which leaks into deactivation pin bore <b>94</b> to drain from within pin bore <b>94</b>, thereby preventing a lock-up condition of pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>. Further, drain aperture <b>96</b> is preferably oriented in the direction of reciprocation of DRHVL <b>10</b> to take advantage of the reciprocation of DRHVL <b>10</b> to promote the drainage of fluid therethrough and, thereby, the removal of any fluid which has penetrated into deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> retracted from annular pin chamber <b>42</b>, the vertical displacement of lifter body <b>14</b> through the operation of roller <b>12</b> is no longer transferred through pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> to pin housing <b>20</b>. Thus, pin housing <b>20</b>, plunger assembly <b>18</b> and pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> no longer move in conjunction with lifter body <b>14</b> when deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> is in its deactivated state. Only lifter body <b>14</b> will be vertically displaced by the operation of the cam. Therefore, a push rod (not shown) seated in pushrod seat assembly <b>22</b> will not undergo reciprocal vertical motion, and will not operate its corresponding valve.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the deactivated state, as lifter body <b>14</b> is vertically displaced by the engine cam lobe, lost motion spring <b>24</b> is compressed. As the cam lobe returns to its lowest lift profile, lost motion spring <b>24</b> expands and exerts, through spring seat <b>23</b>, a downward force on lifter body <b>14</b> until flange <b>132</b> and collar <b>130</b> simultaneously contact lifter body <b>14</b> and pin housing <b>20</b>, respectively. Any lift loss that occurs due to leakdown is recovered through the expanding action of plunger spring <b>64</b>. Thus, the lash remaining in DRHVL <b>10</b> is limited to the gap G which is precisely set through the dimensions of spring seat <b>23</b>. Excessive lash will accelerate wear of valve train components. Thus, where excessive lash exists, the interfacing components are pounded together as they are reciprocated by the cam. The pounding significantly increases wear and tear of the components, and possibly premature lifter or valve train failure. As will be described in more detail hereinafter, spring seat <b>23</b> sets an appropriate amount of lash, thereby preventing excessive wear and premature valve train failure. The dimensions of spring seat <b>23</b> are precisely controlled during manufacture. Thus, gap G and the amount of lash incorporated into DRHVL <b>10</b> are precisely controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Lost motion spring <b>24</b> prevents separation between DRHVL <b>10</b> and the engine cam in the deactivated or disengaged state. Further, lost motion spring <b>24</b> resists the expansion of DRHVL <b>10</b> when the cam is at its lowest lift profile position. The tendency of DRHVL <b>10</b> to expand is due to the force exerted by plunger spring <b>64</b> and oil pressure within high pressure chamber <b>100</b> acting upon plunger <b>60</b>. These forces tend to displace pin housing <b>20</b> downward toward roller <b>12</b>, thereby reducing gap G. Thus, the oil pressure within high pressure chamber <b>100</b> and the force exerted by plunger spring <b>64</b> will expand, or pump-up, DRHVL <b>10</b> by displacing pin housing <b>20</b> downward toward roller <b>12</b>. Spring tower <b>26</b> is firmly engaged with pin housing <b>20</b>, and thus any downward movement of or force upon pin housing <b>20</b> will be transferred to spring tower <b>26</b>. Thus, a compressive force, or a force in a direction toward roller <b>12</b>, is exerted <b>20</b> upon lost motion spring <b>24</b> via the downward force or movement of pin housing <b>20</b> which is transferred to spring tower <b>26</b>. The pre-load or installed load of lost motion spring <b>24</b> is selected to resist the tendency of DRHVL <b>10</b> to pump-up or expand. If expansion is not resisted or limited by the installed load of lost motion spring <b>24</b>, gap G will be reduced as pin housing <b>20</b> is displaced downward relative to pin chamber <b>42</b>. Such unrestrained expansion and downward displacement of pin housing <b>20</b> may potentially adversely affect the ability of locking pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to engage within pin chamber <b>42</b>. If lost motion spring <b>24</b> is inadequately sized, gap G could be reduced an amount sufficient to prohibit the engagement of locking pins <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> within pin chamber <b>42</b>. Thus, lost motion spring <b>24</b> must be selected to resist the compressive forces exerted thereon due to the hydraulic element, operating oil pressure, and plunger spring.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Disposing lost motion spring <b>24</b> above lifter body <b>14</b>, but within the plan envelope of DRHVL <b>10</b>, provides increased space in which a larger lost motion spring <b>24</b> can be accommodated, which, in turn, enables the use in DRHVL <b>10</b> of a larger hydraulic element, higher operating oil pressure, and stronger plunger spring. Further, disposing lost motion spring <b>24</b> within the plan envelope of DRHVL <b>10</b> permits the insertion of DRHVL <b>10</b> into a standard-sized lifter anti-rotation guide. Spring tower <b>26</b> is, in effect, a reduced-diameter extension of pin housing <b>20</b>. The diameter of spring tower <b>26</b> is a predetermined amount less than the diameter of pin housing <b>20</b> such that lost motion spring <b>24</b> can be of sufficient size and yet remain within the plan envelope of lifter body <b>14</b>. Thus, spring tower <b>26</b> enables lost motion spring <b>24</b> to be appropriately sized and remain within the plan envelope of DRHVL <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Spring seat <b>23</b> is disposed intermediate lifter body <b>14</b> and lost motion spring <b>24</b> such that flange portion <b>132</b> of spring seat <b>23</b> is disposed adjacent lost motion spring <b>24</b>, and such that a first end <b>131</b> of collar portion <b>130</b> is disposed adjacent upper end <b>78</b> of pin housing <b>20</b>. Spring seat <b>23</b> determines the relative positions of lifter body <b>14</b> and pin housing <b>20</b>. More particularly, the axial dimension L, or length, of collar <b>130</b> determines the relative axial positions of lifter body <b>14</b> and pin housing <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, gap G exists between the bottom of annular pin chamber <b>42</b> and the bottom of pin faces <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>. By changing the axial dimension of collar <b>130</b> gap G can be precisely manipulated. For example, lengthening collar <b>130</b> places pin housing <b>20</b> axially lower relative to lifter body <b>14</b> thereby decreasing the height of gap G. By adjusting the axial dimension of collar <b>130</b>, variations in manufacturing tolerances and variations in the dimensions of the component parts of DRHVL <b>10</b> can be accurately compensated for while a tight tolerance on gap G is accurately maintained. Flexibility in manufacture and assembly is accomplished by manufacturing a number of spring seats <b>23</b> having collars <b>130</b> of various predetermined axial dimensions. A particular spring seat <b>23</b> would be selected based upon the axial dimension of collar <b>130</b> in order to produce a DRHVL <b>10</b> having an appropriately-sized gap G.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment shown, lifter body <b>14</b> is sized to be received within a standard-sized anti-rotation guide or within a standard-sized lifter bore of a push-rod type internal combustion engine. However, it is to be understood that lifter body <b>14</b> may be alternately configured to have a greater or smaller size and/or diameter and therefore be received within variously sized lifter bores and/or anti-rotation guides.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the embodiment shown, annular pin chamber <b>42</b> is disclosed as being configured as a contiguous annular pin chamber. However, it is to be understood that annular pin chamber <b>42</b> may be alternately configured, such as, for example, as two or more non-contiguous annular chambers configured to receive a corresponding one of deactivation pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>. In this configuration, each annular pin chamber includes a corresponding control port through which the pressurized fluid is injected to retract a respective pin member from within the corresponding annular pin chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiment shown, pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are disclosed as round pin members having flats <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>, respectively. However, it is to be understood that pin members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> may be alternately configured, such as, for example, square or oval pin members having respective flats, or may be configured without flats, and be received within a correspondingly configured pin chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment shown, plunger ball <b>62</b> and ball retainer <b>66</b> conjunctively define a ball-type check valve. However, it is to be understood that DRHVL <b>10</b> may be alternately configured with, such as, for example, a plate-type check valve or any other suitable valve.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment shown, deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> includes two pin members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. However, it is to be understood that deactivation pin assembly <b>16</b> may include a single pin member or any desired number of pin members.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiment shown, stop pins <b>148</b> are disposed within a respective one of stop pin apertures <b>98</b> and extend radially inward to intersect with one side wall of deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>. However, it is to be understood that stop pin apertures <b>98</b> may extend radially inward from locations on opposite sides of pin housing <b>20</b> and intersect with opposite side walls of deactivation pin bore <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the embodiment shown, insert <b>124</b> is inserted by, for example, pressing into pushrod seat orifice <b>122</b>.
