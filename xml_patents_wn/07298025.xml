<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/337,438, entitled “MICROELECTRONIC COMPONENT ASSEMBLIES AND MICROELECTRONIC COMPONENT LEAD FRAME STRUCTURES” filed Jan. 6, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,734, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to packaged microelectronic components and methods for assembling the same. In particular, aspects of the invention relate to microelectronic component lead frame structures and to stacked microelectronic component assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor chips or dies are typically encapsulated in a package that protects the chips from the surrounding environment. The packages typically include leads or other connection points that allow the encapsulated chip to be electrically coupled to another microelectronic component. Leaded packages include a semiconductor chip bonded to a lead frame either seated on a die paddle or directly to the leads, e.g., in a leads-over-chip attachment. The contacts pads on the semiconductor die are then electrically connected to the chip, e.g., by wire bonding. The connected lead frame and chip may then be encapsulated in a mold compound to complete the microelectronic component package. In most common applications, the leads extend out from the mold compound, allowing the chip to be electrically accessed. Typically, the leads extend laterally outwardly in a flat array that is part of a lead frame. This lead frame may be trimmed and formed into a desired configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One increasingly popular technique for maximizing device density on a substrate is to stack microelectronic devices on top of one another. Stacking just one device on top of a lower device can effectively double the circuitry within a given footprint; stacking additional devices can further increase the circuit density. In one approach, individual microelectronic components, e.g., individual semiconductor dies, are separately packaged. These separate packages are then stacked atop one another to form a multi-package assembly. Such an approach is illustrated in PCT International Publication Number WO99/65062, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an alternative approach, multiple microelectronic components are assembled in a single package. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> schematically illustrate a thin small outline package (TSOP) <b>10</b> that includes an upper microelectronic component <b>20</b> and a lower microelectronic component <b>30</b>. Typically, these microelectronic components are semiconductor dies. Leads <b>42</b> of an upper lead frame <b>40</b> may be physically attached to the upper microelectronic component <b>20</b> via an adhesive, such as a conventional lead-on-chip tape. The inner lengths <b>44</b> of some or all of the leads <b>42</b> are electrically coupled to the upper microelectronic component <b>20</b> by individual wire bonds <b>24</b>. Similarly, leads <b>52</b> of a lower lead frame <b>50</b> are physically attached to the lower microelectronic component <b>30</b> by an adhesive <b>32</b>. Wire bonds <b>34</b> electrically connect the inner lengths <b>54</b> of selected leads <b>52</b> to the lower microelectronic component <b>30</b>. The upper microelectronic component <b>20</b> and the lower microelectronic component <b>30</b> may be attached in a variety of ways, such as by a die attach adhesive <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The microelectronic components <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> and the inner lengths <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> of the leads <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively, may be encapsulated in a mold compound <b>12</b>. An outer length <b>46</b> of each lead <b>42</b> of the upper lead frame <b>40</b> extends outwardly beyond a periphery <b>14</b> of the mold compound <b>12</b>. Similarly, an outer length <b>56</b> of each lead <b>52</b> of the lower lead frame <b>50</b> extends outwardly beyond the periphery <b>14</b> of the mold compound <b>12</b>. The outer lengths <b>56</b> of the lower leads <b>52</b> may be shaped for connection to a substrate or another microelectronic component. The TSOP <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> employs lower leads <b>52</b> with generally S-shaped outer lengths, which is commonplace for TSOPs; a wide variety of other shapes are known in the art for use in different applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The upper leads <b>42</b> of the TSOP <b>10</b> are appreciably shorter than the lower leads <b>52</b>. In this design, the upper leads <b>42</b> are too short to directly contact another component, such as a substrate. Instead, the lower leads <b>52</b> are coupled to the substrate (not shown) and the upper leads <b>42</b> communicate with the substrate via an electrical connection to the lower leads <b>52</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the leads <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> may be electrically connected using a conventional solder dip process. In such a process, the outer lengths <b>46</b> and <b>56</b> of the leads <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively, are dipped in a bath of molten solder. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to promote an optimal electrical connection between the upper lead <b>42</b> and the lower lead <b>52</b>, the solder may cover the entire outer length <b>46</b> of the upper lead <b>42</b>. Unfortunately, current designs tend to require an undue amount of solder to completely cover the outer length <b>46</b> of the upper lead <b>42</b> and to establish consistently reliable electrical connections between the upper lead <b>42</b> and lower lead <b>52</b> of each vertically superimposed pair of leads (only one pair being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One factor that may contribute to the need for an excess of solder is the width of the dam bar used in manufacturing the upper leads <b>42</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> schematically illustrate aspects of this manufacturing process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lead frame <b>40</b> initially includes a dam bar <b>48</b> that connects the outer lengths <b>46</b>. In particular, a dam bar element <b>49</b> is connected to two adjacent leads <b>42</b> and spans the space between the outer lengths <b>46</b> of the adjacent leads <b>42</b>. The dam bar <b>48</b> (which may be considered as comprising the dam bar elements <b>49</b> and an outer tip portion of each of the leads <b>42</b>) both physically supports the outer lengths <b>46</b> of the leads <b>42</b> during handling and helps block or dam the flow of the mold compound <b>12</b> during the molding operation. The dam bar elements <b>49</b> also electrically short adjacent leads <b>42</b> to one another and must be removed to electrically isolate the upper leads <b>42</b> from one another. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the same package <b>10</b> after the dam bar <b>48</b> has been trimmed to remove the dam bar elements <b>49</b>. Once the dam bar <b>48</b> has been trimmed into the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the outer lengths <b>56</b> of the lower leads <b>52</b> may be formed into the desired shape, e.g., the S shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bending the outer lengths <b>56</b> of the lower leads <b>52</b> will tend to leave a gap <b>62</b> between the lower lead <b>52</b> and the upper lead <b>42</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the leads <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> are solder-dipped, the solder <b>60</b> is expected to fill this gap <b>62</b>. The cantilevered distance of the outer length <b>46</b> extending outwardly above the gap <b>62</b> is attributable in large part to the width W of the dam bar <b>48</b>. Reducing the width W of the dam bar <b>48</b> could reduce the size of the gap <b>62</b> and the amount of solder <b>60</b> necessary to fill the gap <b>62</b>. However, making the dam bar <b>48</b> too thin could sacrifice the requisite structural integrity of the lead frame <b>40</b>, making the lead frame <b>40</b> less able to withstand the rigors of normal handling during manufacture. Making the dam bar <b>48</b> thinner may also compromise the ability of the dam bar <b>48</b> to block the flow of mold compound during the encapsulation process.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For ease of understanding, the following discussion is subdivided into three areas of emphasis. The first section discusses certain microelectronic component lead frame structures; the second section relates to stacked microelectronic component assemblies in select embodiments; and the third section outlines methods in accordance with other embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">B. Microelectronic Component Lead Frame Structures</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> illustrate aspects of a lead frame structure <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment. The lead frame structure <b>100</b> includes a plurality of leads <b>110</b> arranged in a predetermined fashion to achieve the desired electrical connectivity with a microelectronic component <b>150</b>. The lead frame structure <b>100</b> may be thought of as including a first bank of leads <b>110</b><i>a </i>extending outwardly from the microelectronic component <b>150</b> in a first direction toward a first dam bar <b>130</b><i>a </i>and a second bank of leads <b>110</b><i>b </i>extending in a second, generally opposite, direction from the microelectronic component <b>150</b> to a second dam bar <b>130</b><i>b</i>. For purposes of the following discussion, the structure of the leads <b>110</b><i>a </i>in the first bank and <b>110</b><i>b </i>in the second bank may be substantially the same. Hence, in most of the following discussion and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, the leads will be generally referred to by the reference number <b>110</b> and the dam bars will be generally referred to by the reference number <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the leads <b>110</b> includes an inner length <b>112</b> (<b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), an outer length <b>114</b>, and an outer tip portion <b>116</b>. The inner lengths <b>112</b> of the leads <b>110</b> may be electrically coupled to contacts <b>152</b> of the microelectronic component <b>150</b> by the plurality of wire bonds <b>154</b>. The microelectronic component <b>150</b> may comprise a semiconductor die, for example, with a row of bond pads aligned down a center line to define a row of contacts <b>152</b>. If so desired, each of the leads <b>110</b> may be electrically connected to one or more contacts <b>152</b>. As suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, though, it is anticipated that, in some embodiments, a number of the leads <b>110</b> will not be electrically coupled to the microelectronic component <b>150</b>. The inner lengths <b>112</b> of these leads <b>110</b> may still be physically supported by the microelectronic component, e.g., by employing a conventional adhesive lead-on-chip tape.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the outer lengths <b>114</b> of the leads <b>110</b> may be generally parallel to one another and spaced from one another by a lead gap <b>125</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer lengths <b>114</b> of the leads <b>110</b> are spaced a fixed distance from one another, yielding a uniform lead gap <b>125</b> between the pairs of adjacent outer lengths <b>114</b>. The dam bar <b>130</b> generally comprises a plurality of dam bar elements <b>134</b> and the outer tip portions <b>116</b> of the leads <b>110</b>. Each dam bar element <b>134</b> spans a lead gap <b>125</b> between an adjacent pair of lead outer lengths <b>114</b>. In particular, each dam bar element <b>134</b> is joined at a first longitudinal end to a side of the outer tip portion <b>116</b> of one lead <b>110</b> and is joined at a second longitudinal end to a side of the outer tip portion <b>116</b> of another lead <b>110</b>. The dam bar elements <b>134</b> may be joined to the adjacent outer tip portions <b>116</b> in any desired fashion. In one embodiment, the dam bar elements <b>134</b> and the leads <b>110</b> are all integrally formed from a single sheet of metal foil, e.g., a sheet of copper, aluminum, alloy <b>42</b>, or other metals (e.g., metal alloys) were known in the field. Other conventional lead frame materials may be used instead of such a metal foil. The lead frame structure <b>100</b> may be formed in any suitable fashion, such as by a stamping process or using photolithographic etching.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The outer tip portion <b>116</b> of each lead <b>110</b> includes an outer edge <b>118</b>. Similarly, each dam bar element <b>134</b> has an outer edge <b>135</b>. The outer edges <b>118</b> and <b>135</b> together define an outer edge <b>132</b> of the dam bar <b>130</b>. This outer edge <b>132</b> may take any of a variety of shapes. In one embodiment, the outer edge <b>118</b> of each outer tip portion <b>116</b> includes an inwardly extending recess <b>120</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, each of the recesses <b>120</b> comprises a concave arc having a radius R<sub>1</sub>. This radius R<sub>1 </sub>may be varied as desired and the position of the center of the arc may be selected to yield a recess <b>120</b> having the desired width and depth. In one particular embodiment wherein the outer length <b>114</b> of each of the leads <b>110</b> has a width of about 0.32 millimeters, the radius R<sub>1 </sub>of the recess may be on the order of about 0.1 millimeters. Although the lead frame structure <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> employs lead outer edges <b>118</b> with a circular arc recess <b>120</b>, the recesses <b>120</b> are not limited to this shape. Square, V-shaped, and elliptical recesses, for example, may also suffice.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The position of the recess <b>120</b> along the length of the outer edge <b>118</b> may be varied. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the recesses <b>120</b> is generally centered about the midline M of the outer length <b>114</b> of the associated lead <b>110</b>. As a consequence, each recess <b>120</b> curves inwardly from a location adjacent to each of the adjoining dam bar elements <b>134</b> toward the midline M of the outer tip portion <b>116</b>. This increases the width of the dam bar <b>130</b> where the dam bar elements <b>134</b> are joined to the leads <b>110</b>, but reduces the total length of the lead outer lengths <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The outer edge <b>135</b> of each dam bar element <b>134</b> may take on any suitable shape. In one embodiment, the outer edges <b>135</b> are substantially straight, yielding a dam bar <b>130</b> having an irregular outer edge <b>132</b> that is generally straight, but is punctuated with a recess <b>120</b> associated with each lead outer length <b>114</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, however, the outer edge <b>135</b> of each dam bar element <b>134</b> is curved. In particular, the outer edges <b>135</b> are circular arcs having a radius R<sub>2</sub>. This radius R<sub>2 </sub>is greater than the radius R<sub>1</sub>, yielding a dam bar element outer edge <b>135</b> that curves more gradually than does the recess <b>120</b> in the lead outer edge <b>118</b>. In other embodiments, these two radii R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>may be substantially the same or the radius R<sub>1 </sub>of the recess <b>120</b> may be greater than the radius of curvature R<sub>2 </sub>of the dam bar element outer edge <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Whereas the recesses <b>120</b> in the lead outer edges <b>118</b> are convex, inwardly extending arcs, the outer edge <b>135</b> of each dam bar element <b>134</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> extends farther outwardly (i.e., to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) than the outer edges <b>118</b> of the two adjacent leads <b>110</b>. If so desired, the convex curve of each dam bar element outer edge <b>135</b> may merge tangentially into the concave arcuate recess <b>120</b> of both of the adjacent lead outer edges <b>118</b>, as shown. This will yield a dam bar outer edge <b>132</b> wherein the outer edge <b>135</b> of each dam bar element <b>134</b> merges smoothly and without a sharp discontinuity into an adjacent portion of the outer edge <b>118</b> of each adjacent outer tip portion <b>116</b>. Having a relatively smooth, scalloped outer edge <b>132</b> as shown avoids sharp discontinuities and curvature that may represent points of stress concentration in the lead frame structure <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the lead outer lengths <b>114</b> are spaced regularly, i.e., the lead gap <b>125</b> between each adjacent pair of lead outer lengths <b>114</b> is constant. As a result, the dam bar outer edge <b>132</b> has a periodic curve structure, with a minimum of the curve structure associated with the outer edge <b>118</b> of each lead <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one set of leads <b>110</b> adapted for use with a single microelectronic component <b>150</b>. To facilitate holding the lead frame structure <b>100</b> during the wire bonding and subsequent encapsulation steps, the lead frame structure <b>100</b> may include a first end member <b>140</b><i>a </i>and a second end member <b>140</b><i>b </i>extending along opposite ends of the set of leads <b>110</b>. Each of the dam bars <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be attached to the first end member <b>140</b><i>a </i>by a first strap <b>142</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the opposite end of each dam bar <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be attached to the second end member <b>140</b><i>b </i>by a strap <b>142</b><i>b</i>. These straps <b>142</b> may be severed in a subsequent trimming operation, as discussed below. Each of the end members <b>140</b> may be provided with a series of alignment holes <b>144</b>. As is known in the art, such alignment holes may be useful in properly aligning the lead frame structure <b>100</b> for subsequent wire bonding, encapsulation, and trimming operations.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, a plurality of such sets of leads are arranged in an array. One such array is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The lead frame structure <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> comprises a linear array with adjacent lead sets (shown schematically as boxes <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) positioned side by side. The first end member <b>140</b><i>a </i>may extend laterally along one edge of each of the lead sets <b>102</b> while the second end member <b>140</b><i>b </i>may extend laterally along the opposite edge of each lead set <b>102</b>. Other nonlinear arrays, such as square or rectangular arrays with multiple rows and columns of lead sets <b>102</b>, may be used instead of the linear array shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">C. Stacked Microelectronic Component Assemblies</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a fragmentary, schematic end view of a portion of a microelectronic component assembly <b>160</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref> illustrate sequential stages in the manufacture of this assembled microelectronic component <b>160</b>. For the sake of simplicity, most of the elements of the microelectronic component assembly <b>160</b> within the mold compound <b>162</b> have been omitted from these Figures. It is contemplated that the structure within the mold compound <b>162</b> may resemble that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with a pair of microelectronic components (<b>20</b> and <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) attached to one another and wire bonded to the inner lengths <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> of the leads <b>110</b> and inner lengths (not shown) of leads <b>172</b> of a second lead frame <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the lower lead frame <b>170</b> may have a plurality of leads <b>172</b>, each of which has an outer length <b>174</b> extending outwardly beyond the periphery <b>164</b> of the mold compound <b>162</b>. The outer length <b>174</b> of each of these lower leads <b>172</b> may be aligned with the outer length <b>114</b> of one of the upper leads <b>110</b>. (Although the leads <b>110</b> are characterized as “upper” leads and the leads <b>172</b> are characterized as “lower” leads, it should be understood that this is merely for purposes of convenience and reflects the orientation of these components as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. Hence, the “lower” leads <b>172</b> need not be positioned vertically beneath the “upper” leads <b>110</b>, for example.) The outer length <b>174</b> of the lower leads <b>172</b> extends outwardly from the periphery <b>164</b> of the mold compound <b>160</b> farther than does the outer length <b>114</b> of the upper leads <b>110</b>. As a consequence, the outer edge <b>176</b> of each lower lead <b>172</b> is spaced outwardly from the mold compound <b>162</b> farther than the outer edge <b>118</b> of the outer tip portion <b>116</b> of the aligned upper lead <b>110</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer edge <b>176</b> of each lower lead <b>172</b> is spaced outwardly farther than any part of the outer edge <b>132</b> of the dam bar <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> after the dam bar <b>130</b> has been trimmed. In particular, the majority or the entirety of each of the dam bar elements <b>134</b> has been trimmed away, physically separating and electrically isolating each of the upper lead outer lengths <b>114</b> from one another. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> demonstrates that the outer tip portion <b>116</b> of leads <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are appreciably shorter than the outer tip portions <b>46</b> of the leads <b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As a consequence, it will take less solder to cover the outer tip portions <b>116</b> of the leads <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> than it will to cover the outer tip portions <b>46</b> of the leads <b>42</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This reduced-size outer tip portion can be employed without unduly sacrificing the structural integrity and damming function of the dam bar <b>130</b> by having dam bar elements <b>134</b> that extend outwardly beyond the outer edge <b>118</b> of the leads and/or having recesses <b>120</b> in the outer edges of the leads <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>, the outer lengths <b>174</b> of the lower leads <b>172</b> are illustrated as being substantially straight, extending generally horizontally outwardly beyond the periphery <b>164</b> of the mold compound <b>162</b>. Using conventional forming techniques, the outer lengths <b>174</b> of the lower leads <b>172</b> may be bent into the desired final shape. If so desired, this may be an S shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, though other shapes are certainly possible. If so desired, the outer tip portion <b>116</b> of each of the upper leads <b>110</b> may be bent with the outer lengths <b>174</b> of the lower leads <b>172</b> so that the entire length of the outer tip portion <b>116</b> lies flush against a surface of the lower lead <b>172</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Alternatively, the outer tip portions <b>116</b> of the upper leads <b>110</b> may be left as-is without being bent during the forming operation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the outer length <b>174</b> of the lower lead <b>172</b> has a middle portion that extends substantially vertically in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In one embodiment, the outer edges <b>118</b> of the upper leads <b>110</b> extend outwardly beyond the periphery <b>164</b> of the mold compound <b>162</b> a distance no greater than the lateral projection of the outer surface of the vertically extending middle portion <b>173</b> of the lower lead outer length <b>174</b>. If so desired, the outer edge <b>118</b> of each of the upper leads <b>110</b> may be spaced slightly inwardly from the outer surface of this middle portion <b>173</b>. In one embodiment, the angle between the outer surface of the middle portion <b>173</b> and the outer edge <b>118</b> of the aligned lead <b>110</b>, identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as angle A, is between about 0 degrees and about 5 degrees.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">D. Methods</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted above, certain aspects of the present invention provide methods for assembling microelectronic component assemblies. The following discussion of at least one such method refers to the specific embodiments shown in the previous drawings. It should be recognized, however, that this is intended solely to promote understanding and that any of a variety of other structures may be employed instead.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In assembling a microelectronic component assembly in accordance with one embodiment, a lead frame structure <b>100</b> is positioned with respect to a microelectronic component <b>150</b>. The microelectronic component <b>150</b> may, for example, comprise a semiconductor die having a plurality of wire bond pads. At least some of the leads <b>110</b> of the lead frame structure <b>100</b> may be electrically coupled to the microelectronic component <b>150</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, this may be accomplished by wire bonding the inner lengths <b>112</b> of selected leads <b>110</b> to one or more contacts <b>152</b> carried by the microelectronic component <b>150</b>. A second microelectronic component (not shown) may be attached to leads <b>172</b> of another lead frame <b>170</b> in a similar fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first and second lead frames <b>100</b> and <b>170</b>, respectively, may be juxtaposed with one another. If so desired, the first and second microelectronic components may be attached to one another, e.g., using a die attach adhesive (shown schematically as reference number <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When the first and second lead frames <b>110</b> and <b>170</b> are juxtaposed with one another, each of the leads <b>110</b> of the first lead frame is juxtaposed with one of the leads <b>172</b> of the second lead frame <b>170</b>. In one embodiment, these juxtaposed leads may be in direct physical contact with one another to enhance electrical connection therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A portion of the resultant structure can be encapsulated in a mold compound using conventional molding techniques. The mold compound is formed such that it encapsulates the first and second microelectronic components, the inner lengths <b>112</b> of the upper leads <b>110</b>, and the inner leads (not shown) of the lower leads <b>172</b> in the mold compound <b>162</b>. (The periphery of the mold compound <b>160</b> is suggested in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.) This will leave the outer lengths <b>114</b> of the upper leads <b>110</b> and the outer lengths <b>174</b> of the lower leads <b>172</b> exposed outside of the mold compound <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thereafter, the dam bar elements <b>134</b> of the upper lead frame <b>100</b> may be trimmed, physically separating and electrically isolating the upper lead outer lengths <b>114</b> from one another. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, trimming the dam bar elements <b>134</b> will leave the outer tip portion <b>116</b> of each of the upper leads <b>110</b> juxtaposed with the outer length <b>174</b> of each of the lower leads <b>172</b>. If so desired, solder may be applied to the outer tip portions <b>116</b> of the upper leads <b>110</b> and the outer lengths <b>174</b> of the lower leads <b>172</b>, helping to electrically join each upper lead outer length <b>114</b> with the aligned lower lead outer length <b>174</b>. The solder can be applied in any desired fashion, e.g., using a solder dip process.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one adaptation of this method, a plurality of microelectronic components <b>150</b> may be attached to sets of leads <b>102</b> arranged in an array, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. If such a structure is employed, the straps <b>142</b> joining the dam bars <b>130</b> to the end members <b>140</b> may be severed to separate the packaged microelectronic component assembly from the end members <b>140</b>. In one embodiment, these straps <b>142</b> are severed during the dam bar trim operation.</p>
