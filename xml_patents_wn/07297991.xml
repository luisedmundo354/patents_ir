<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and its fabricating method, and more particularly, to a self-aligned BJT and a self-aligned method for producing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A bipolar junction transistor utilizes two type of carriers, “electrons” and “hot holes”, to transmit current. The BJT continues to be a basic circuit element in integrated circuits due to its high switching capability and current carrying capacity. However, the electrons/holes mobility of a silicon BJT, which has a silicon substrate, is lower and not suitable for being applied in high frequency devices. Therefore, the silicon BJT has been replaced with a GaAs BJT, which has a GaAs substrate, or a SiGe hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT) in recently semiconductor processes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which are schematic diagrams illustrating a conventional method for forming a silicon BJT. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the silicon BJT is formed on a P-type single crystal silicon substrate <b>10</b> including a heavily doped N type (N<sup>+</sup>) region <b>12</b> and heavily doped P type (P<sup>+</sup>) regions <b>14</b> formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. First, an N-epitaxial layer <b>16</b> is thermally grown on the substrate <b>10</b>, which has a thickness of about 1.2 micrometers (μm). During formation of the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>, dopants of the N<sup>+</sup> region <b>12</b> and the P<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> diffuse upward into the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>. Then, a silicon dioxide layer <b>18</b> and a silicon nitride layer <b>20</b> are formed on the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>, respectively. A photolithographic and etching process is performed to remove a portion of the silicon nitride layer <b>20</b>, the silicon dioxide layer <b>18</b> and the epitaxial layer <b>16</b> to expose a portion of the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>, thus forming a plurality of openings <b>22</b> in the silicon nitride layer <b>20</b>, the silicon dioxide layer <b>18</b>, and the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a thermal growth process is performed to oxidize the exposed epitaxial layer <b>16</b> to an oxide layer <b>24</b>, which fills in the opening <b>22</b>, with a top surface of the oxide layer <b>24</b> being approximately equal to a top surface of silicon dioxide layer <b>18</b>. After that, the remained silicon nitride layer <b>20</b> is removed. During thermal growth of the oxide layer <b>24</b>, the dopants of the N<sup>+</sup> region <b>12</b> and the P<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> are diffused further upward to broaden the N<sup>+</sup> region <b>12</b> and P<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b>. Afterwards, a photoresist layer <b>26</b> is deposited on the oxide layer <b>24</b>, and the photoresist layer <b>26</b> is exposed and developed to form an opening <b>27</b> in the photoresist layer <b>26</b>. Then, suitable N-type dopants, such as phosphorus (P), are ion implanted through the opening <b>27</b> to form an N<sup>+</sup> collector region <b>28</b> within the epitaxial layer <b>16</b> and beneath the oxide layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the remnant photoresist layer <b>26</b> is removed and another patterned photoresist layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is formed on the oxide layer <b>24</b>. A wet etching process or a reactive ion etching (RIE) process is performed to remove a portion of the oxide layer <b>24</b> above the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>, thus forming an opening <b>30</b> in the oxide layer <b>24</b>. Then, a P-polysilicon layer <b>32</b> and a silicon dioxide layer <b>34</b> are formed on the substrate <b>10</b>, respectively. Typically, the polysilicon layer <b>32</b> has a thickness of about 8000 angstroms (Å), and the silicon dioxide layer <b>34</b> has a thickness of about 5000 to 6000 Å. A patterned photoresist layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is formed on the silicon oxide layer <b>34</b>, and a photolithographic and etching process is performed to remove a portion of the silicon dioxide layer <b>34</b> and the polysilicon layer <b>32</b> to form an opening <b>36</b> in the silicon dioxide layer <b>34</b> and the polysilicon layer <b>32</b>, and a portion of the epitaxial layer <b>16</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a silicon dioxide layer <b>38</b> is thermally grown on the substrate <b>10</b> that covers a bottom and a sidewall of the opening <b>36</b> uniformly. Typically, the silicon dioxide layer <b>38</b> has a thickness of between 0.2 to 0.4 μm. During formation of the silicon dioxide layer <b>38</b>, P-type dopants of the polysilicon layer <b>32</b> diffuse downwards into the N-epitaxial layer <b>16</b> to form P-extrinsic base regions <b>40</b> within the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>. Then, a directional RIE process is performed to remove a portion of the silicon dioxide layer <b>38</b> in the bottom of the opening <b>36</b> and on the oxide layer <b>24</b>. Further, a relatively low-energy, high-dose ion implantation is performed to form an N shallow emitter region <b>42</b> within the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>, which has a thickness of about 0.2 μm, by implanting the arsenic (As) ions through the opening <b>36</b> into the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>. Similarly, a relatively high-energy, high-dose ion implantation is performed to form an N<sup>+</sup> raised subcollector <b>44</b>, which has a thickness of about 0.2 micrometers, by implanting phosphorus (P) ions through the opening <b>36</b> into the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>. The energy and heat cycling conditions for the phosphorus implantation are selected such that the bottom of the raised subcollector <b>44</b> nominally submerges into the N<sup>+</sup> region <b>12</b>. And a relatively middle-energy, low-dose boron ion implantation is performed to form an intrinsic base region <b>46</b> beneath the shallow emitter region <b>42</b> and above the raised subcollector <b>44</b>, by implanting the As ions through the opening <b>36</b> into the epitaxial layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a photolithographic and etching process is performed to form two contact vias (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) on the polysilicon layer <b>32</b> and the collector region <b>28</b>. Then, a metal layer is filled in the contact vias and the opening <b>36</b> to form three metal contacts <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>48</b>, and the conventional BJT is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As stated above, the conventional method for forming the BJT is very complicated. Although the intrinsic base region <b>46</b> and the emitter region <b>42</b> of the BJT are formed by the self-aligned method, the extrinsic base regions <b>40</b> are formed by the thermal diffusion process. So that the contact area between the intrinsic base region, the extrinsic base region and the collector region cannot be controlled precisely. Thus causing higher capacitance between the base region and the collector region and the conventional BJT is not suitable for being applied in high frequency devices. In addition, the interference of the PN junction of the BJT is clearer, the performance of the device is better. However while the SiGe HBT can function in high temperatures, the interference between the SiGe epitaxial layer and silicon of the SiGe HBT will generate a plurality of intersectional arrangements and thus destroy the its high speed characteristic. For this reason, the temperature for forming the SiGe epitaxial layer has to be controlled to be below 700° C. But the conventional BJT has to utilize the thermal diffusion process many times, and therefore the conventional method is not suitable for forming the HBT.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is therefore a primary objective of the claimed invention to provide a method for forming a PN junction of a self-aligned bipolar junction transistor (BJT).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the claimed invention to provide a self-aligned hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT), which is suitable for being applied in high frequency devices.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the claimed invention, a bipolar junction transistor includes a dielectric layer formed on a substrate, an opening formed in the dielectric layer to expose a portion of the substrate, a semiconductor layer formed on a sidewall and a bottom of the opening, the semiconductor layer extending outside the opening and above the dielectric layer, a spacer formed on the semiconductor layer to define a self-aligned emitter region in the opening, an emitter conductivity layer being filled with the self-aligned emitter region and a PN junction being formed between the emitter conductivity layer and the semiconductor layer, and a salicide layer formed on the emitter conductivity layer and on the portion of the semiconductor layer extending outside the opening and above the dielectric layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The claimed invention utilizes the semiconductor layer to form an intrinsic base region in the opening, and utilizes the spacer formed on the semiconductor layer to define the self-aligned emitter region in the opening. Accordingly, only one opening has to be formed, so that the emitter, the base, and the collector of the BJT can be formed with small size and high efficiency by using the self-aligned method of the claimed invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other objectives of the claimed invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p>

The BJT is formed within an active region I of a semiconductor substrate <b>70</b> including an N<sup>+</sup> buried layer <b>72</b> and an N-type nonselective epitaxial layer <b>74</b> formed on the substrate <b>70</b>, respectively. A deep isolation trench <b>76</b> and a heavily doped channel stop region <b>78</b> are formed deep in the substrate <b>70</b> so as to electrically insulate and isolate each of the active regions <b>1</b>. A dielectric layer <b>84</b> is formed on a predetermined region of the substrate <b>70</b>, and an opening (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is formed in the dielectric layer <b>84</b> to expose a portion of the epitaxial layer <b>74</b>. Further, a heavily doped polysilicon layer <b>104</b> is formed on a side-wall of the opening to define a self-aligned base region in the opening, and an intrinsic base doped region <b>105</b> is formed within the epitaxial layer <b>74</b> and in a bottom of the opening by implanting through the self-aligned base region. Then, a spacer <b>106</b> is formed on the heavily doped polysilicon layer <b>104</b> to define a self-aligned emitter region in the opening, and an emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> is filled with the self-aligned emitter region, and thus a PN junction is formed between the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> and the intrinsic base doped region <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which are schematic diagrams illustrating a method for forming a PN junction of the BJT according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the BJT of the present invention is fabricated on a P-type semiconductor substrate <b>70</b> having an active region <b>1</b>. An N<sup>+</sup> buried layer <b>72</b> and an N-type non-selective epitaxial layer <b>74</b> are formed on the substrate <b>70</b>, respectively.

The insulating layer <b>80</b> is composed of a thermal oxide layer and a nitride layer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Then, a dielectric layer <b>84</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>74</b>. For example, a thermal oxidization process is performed on the epitaxial layer <b>74</b> to form a silicon dioxide layer, which has a thickness of approximately 5000 angstroms (Å).

After removing the photoresist layer, a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process is performed to deposit an undoped polysilicon layer <b>88</b> on the dielectric layer <b>84</b>, and then an etching process is performed to remove a portion of the dielectric layer <b>84</b> to fill the collector contact hole <b>86</b> with the undoped polysilicon layer <b>88</b>. Typically, the undoped polysilicon layer <b>88</b> has a thickness of about 2500 Å.

So that a portion of the undoped polysilicon layer <b>88</b> is doped with N-type dopants, and then the photoresist layer is removed. In addition, a PN non-rectifying junction is formed between the collector contact region <b>90</b> and the buried layer <b>72</b>.</p>

After that, a P<sup>+</sup> polysilicon layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is deposited on the substrate <b>70</b> that covers a sidewall and the bottom of the opening <b>98</b>. The P<sup>+</sup> polysilicon layer is doped with B ions with a dosage ranging from 1E19 to 1E20 atoms/cm<sup>2</sup>. Further, an etching back process is performed to remove a portion of the polysilicon layer to expose the epitaxial layer <b>74</b> in the bottom of the opening <b>98</b>, and the residual polysilicon layer <b>104</b> is formed on the sidewall of the opening <b>98</b> to define a self-aligned base region in the opening <b>98</b>. After that, a dosage of about 5E15 atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>B ions is implanted through the self-aligned base region to form a P-type intrinsic base doped region <b>105</b> within the epitaxial layer <b>74</b> and in the bottom of the opening <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an oxide layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) is formed on the substrate <b>70</b> uniformly, and an etching back process is performed to remove a portion of the oxide layer to expose a portion of the epitaxial layer <b>74</b> in the bottom of the opening <b>98</b>, so that the remnant oxide layer on the polysilicon layer <b>104</b> is used as a spacer <b>106</b>, and the spacer <b>106</b> defines a self-aligned emitter region in the opening <b>98</b>. Then, an emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> is filled with the self-aligned emitter region, and a PN junction is formed between the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> and the intrinsic base doped region <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an etching back process is performed to remove a portion of the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b>. Then, a photolithographic and etching process is performed to pattern the polysilicon layer <b>96</b>, and another etching back process is performed to remove a portion of the silicon nitride layer <b>94</b> and the oxide layer <b>92</b>. Further, a self-aligned silicide (salicide) layer <b>110</b> is formed on the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> and the patterned polysilicon layer <b>96</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, which are schematic diagrams illustrating a method for forming a hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT) according to the second embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the HBT of the present invention is fabricated on a P-type semiconductor substrate <b>70</b> having an active region I. An N<sup>+</sup> buried layer <b>72</b> and an N-type non-selective epitaxial layer <b>74</b> are formed on the substrate <b>70</b>, respectively. First, a deep isolation trench is formed two sides of the active region I. Then, a dielectric layer <b>84</b> is formed on the epitaxial layer <b>74</b>. A collector contact hole <b>86</b> is formed in the dielectric layer <b>84</b>, and an undoped polysilicon layer <b>88</b> is filled with the collector contact hole <b>86</b>. Further, an ion implantation process is performed to implant P ions into the exposed undoped polysilicon layer <b>88</b> and a thermal treatment process is performed to drive the P ions into the epitaxial layer <b>74</b> to form an N<sup>+</sup> collector contact region <b>90</b> beneath the undoped polysilicon layer <b>88</b>. A silicon dioxide layer <b>92</b>, a silicon nitride layer <b>94</b>, and an in-situ doped P-type polysilicon layer <b>96</b> are formed on the dielectric layer <b>84</b>, respectively. A patterned photoresist layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) is formed on the polysilicon layer <b>96</b>, and a photolithographic and etching process is performed to form an opening <b>98</b> in the polysilicon layer <b>96</b> to expose a portion of the epitaxial layer <b>74</b>. A selective ion implantation process <b>100</b> is performed to form a SIC <b>102</b> in the exposed epitaxial layer <b>74</b> and in the bottom of the opening <b>98</b>. The in-situ doped P-type polysilicon layer <b>96</b> is used as an extrinsic base of the BJT for controlling the electrode voltage of the BJT.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a P-type SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b>, which covers a sidewall and a bottom of the opening <b>98</b>, is deposited on the substrate <b>70</b>. Selectively, the SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b>, functioning as a P-type intrinsic base, can be replaced by a semiconductor layer formed of group IIIA-VA compounds. For example, the SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b> can be replaced by a semiconductor layer comprises at least one material selected from a material group consisting of GaAs, InP and AlGaAs. Furthermore, the SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b> can also be replaced by a silicon epitaxial layer in a silicon bipolar junction transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Following that, a spacer <b>106</b> is formed on the SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b> in the opening <b>98</b> to define a self-aligned emitter region in the opening <b>98</b>. Then, an emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b>, such as an N-type polysilicon layer, is filled with the self-aligned emitter region, and a PN junction is formed between the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> and the SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b> (intrinsic base).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an etching back process is performed to remove a portion of the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> and the SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b>. The polysilicon layer <b>96</b>, the silicon nitride layer <b>94</b> and the oxide layer <b>92</b> are patterned. A salicide layer <b>110</b> is formed on the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b> and on the portion of the P-type SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b> outside of the opening <b>98</b> and above the dielectric layer <b>84</b>. Finally, an interlayer dielectric layer <b>112</b> is formed on the substrate <b>70</b>, and metal contacts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are formed on the emitter conductivity layer <b>108</b>, the collector contact region <b>90</b>, and the extrinsic base region <b>96</b>, and the HBT of the present invention is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To sum up, the present invention utilizes the heavily doped polysilicon layer <b>104</b> to define the self-aligned base region in the opening <b>98</b> to form the intrinsic base doped region <b>105</b>. Further, the present invention utilizes the spacer <b>106</b> formed on the heavily doped polysilicon layer <b>104</b> to define the self-aligned emitter region in the opening <b>98</b>, and then the emitter conductivity layer is filled with the self-aligned emitter region to form the self-aligned emitter region <b>108</b>. Accordingly, only one opening <b>98</b> is formed, the emitter region <b>108</b>, the base region <b>105</b> and the collector region <b>102</b> of the BJT with small size and high operating efficiency can be formed by using the self-aligned method of the present invention. In addition, the extrinsic base region <b>96</b> is composed of the in-situ polysilicon layer, so that the thermal diffusion process does not have to use to form the extrinsic base region <b>96</b>. Therefore, the contact area between the base region <b>105</b> and the collector region <b>102</b> can be controlled precisely, thus reducing the junction capacitance between the collector region <b>102</b> beneath the extrinsic base region <b>96</b> and the base region <b>105</b>. Furthermore, after formation of the SiGe epitaxial layer <b>103</b>, no thermal diffusion process with high temperature is used, so that the self-aligned method of the present invention is suitable for forming the HBT.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In contrast to the prior art method for forming the BJT, the present invention does not have to use the thermal diffusion process with high temperature to form the extrinsic base region. Therefore, the self-aligned method of the present invention is not only suitable for forming the BJT, bit also for forming the emitter region, base region, and the collector region of the HBT, thus simplifying processes and reducing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.</p>
