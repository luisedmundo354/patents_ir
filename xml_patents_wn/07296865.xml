<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority upon Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-369971 filed on Dec. 21, 2004, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to liquid ejection methods, computer-readable media, liquid ejection apparatuses, and liquid ejection systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inkjet printers are known as an example of liquid ejection apparatuses that eject droplets of a liquid. Inkjet printers carry out printing by ejecting ink from nozzles according to print data while moving a carriage, which is equipped with nozzle groups having a plurality of nozzles provided with elements for ejecting liquid, in a predetermined direction. In these inkjet printers, a drive section for receiving print data and driving the elements is provided for each nozzle group and ordinarily each of these drive sections is made of a single integrated circuit and mounted on the carriage in the same number as there are nozzle groups.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A controller that inputs the print data to the drive sections is fixed to a main unit area of the printer, and the controller and each of the drive sections are connected by a cable such as an FFC having core wires provided corresponding to the drive sections. Thus, the print data is sent to each of the drive sections as serial data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">That is to say, the print data is inputted from the controller to the drive sections via the cable, and printing is carried out by ejecting ink from the nozzles according to the print data that is inputted to the drive sections while the carriage equipped with the plurality of nozzle groups is moved in the predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The number of nozzle groups provided in inkjet printers has increased in recent years to support increased image quality of an image and faster printing speeds. Accordingly, the number of core wires in the cable connecting the controller and the drive sections has increased, thereby making the cable width wider which contributes to increased printer size, and increasing the burden on the carriage due to cable bending, so that it has become more difficult to move the carriage smoothly. Accordingly, thought has been given to transferring the print data that is to be inputted to the plurality of drive sections as serial multiplexed data from the controller to the drive sections using a single core wire (see JP 2001-232774A).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, when transferring the print data which corresponds to a plurality of nozzle groups, as serial multiplexed data from the controller to the drive sections using a single core wire, there is a risk that the print data will deteriorate or that unnecessary data will be taken in due to such factors as the timing for converting the serial multiplexed data to serial data for each drive section.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention was arrived at in light of the foregoing issues, and it is an object thereof to provide a liquid ejection method, a computer-readable medium, a liquid ejection apparatus, and a liquid ejection system capable of converting inputted serial data into serial data in an appropriate drive section unit corresponding to each of the drive sections without deterioration of print data or taking in unnecessary data.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">taking in a predetermined number of the liquid ejection data successively from the liquid ejection data string to a second shift register in synchronization with the first clock signal;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">latching in a latching circuit the liquid ejection data of a number equivalent to the number of the nozzle groups, including the liquid ejection data taken in to the second shift register, in synchronization with the first clock signal outputted after the predetermined number of the liquid ejection data has been taken in to the second shift register;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">after the liquid ejection data has been latched in the latching circuit, taking in the liquid ejection data that is latched in the latching circuit, by the number of the nozzles of the nozzle groups, to a first shift register corresponding to the respective nozzle groups for holding the liquid ejection data together in the predetermined order, in synchronization with a second clock signal generated based on the first clock signal;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">stopping output of the first clock signal after the final liquid ejection data of the liquid ejection data string is taken in to the first shift register and before the s:second clock signal is generated; and</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0041">driving the element based on the liquid ejection data that has been taken in to the first shift register.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">With this liquid ejection method, although the first clock signal from the controller is outputted even after the final liquid ejection data in the liquid ejection data string is taken into the first shift register, after the final liquid ejection data has been taken into the first shift register, output of the first clock signal is stopped before the second clock signal is generated. Accordingly, the second clock signal is not generated after the final liquid ejection data of the liquid ejection data string is taken into the first shift register. Therefore, the data that is latched in the latching circuit after the final liquid ejection data has been taken into the first shift register is not taken into the first shift register. That is, even if any data is taken into the second shift register after the final liquid ejection data in the liquid ejection data string are taken into the first shift register, the data that has been taken in cannot be taken into the first shift register, Accordingly, the final liquid ejection data in the liquid ejection data string is taken into the first shift register until the final items and since data after this is not taken in, it is possible to take into the first shift register only the appropriate liquid ejection data. Then, liquid can be ejected appropriately based on the appropriate liquid ejection data that is taken into the first shift register.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">In this liquid ejection method,</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">the liquid ejection data string outputted from the controller is taken in to the first shift register which is arranged movably relative to the controller via a cable.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">With this liquid ejection method, liquid ejection data corresponding to the nozzle groups can be outputted as a liquid ejection data string when outputting the liquid ejection data from the controller to at least two nozzle groups. Accordingly, the number of core wires of the cable that connects the controller and the first shift register for outputting the liquid ejection data can be a single wire only even when a plurality of nozzle groups are provided, and therefore the width of the cable can be made narrow. Therefore, the liquid ejection apparatus can be made more compact. Also, because a cable having a small number of core wires can bend easily, it is possible to reduce the burden incurred in moving the nozzle groups, and therefore the nozzle groups can be moved smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">In this liquid ejection method, the controller outputs predetermined data following the liquid ejection data string.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">With this liquid ejection method, predetermined data is outputted after the final liquid ejection data string has been taken in, and therefore the predetermined data can be taken into the second shift register synchronized with the first clock signal. Accordingly, the predetermined data can be outputted to the first shift register even if the second clock signal is inadvertently generated. That is, the elements can be driven according to the predetermined data without uncertain data being taken into the second shift register. At this time, consumables such as the liquid can be kept from being wasted by setting predetermined data such that any effect is reduced when the elements are driven according to the predetermined data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">In this liquid ejection method, the liquid is ink.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">With this liquid ejection method, excellent images can be printed by appropriately ejecting ink based on the appropriate liquid ejection data that is taken into the first shift register,</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">Furthermore, a liquid ejection method comprises,</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram that describes the configuration of the computer <b>110</b> and the printer <b>1</b>. First, the configuration of the computer <b>110</b> is described in brief. The computer <b>110</b> has the recording and reproducing device <b>140</b> described above and a host-side controller <b>111</b>. The recording and reproducing device <b>140</b> is communicably connected to the host-side controller <b>111</b>, and for example is attached to the housing of the computer <b>110</b>. The host-side controller <b>111</b> performs various controls in the computer <b>110</b>, and is also communicably connected to the display device <b>120</b> and the input device <b>130</b> mentioned above. The host-side controller <b>111</b> has an interface section <b>112</b>, a CPU <b>113</b>, and a memory <b>114</b>. The interface section <b>112</b> is interposed between the computer <b>110</b> and the printer <b>1</b>, and sends and receives data between the two. The CPU <b>113</b> is a computation processing device for performing the overall control of the computer <b>110</b>. The memory <b>114</b> is for securing, for example, a region for storing computer programs used by the CPU <b>113</b> and a working region, and is constituted by a RAM, EEPROM, ROM, or magnetic disk device, for example. Examples of computer programs that are stored on the memory <b>114</b> include the application program and printer driver mentioned above. The CPU <b>113</b> performs various controls in accordance with the computer programs stored on the memory <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0101">The printer driver causes the computer <b>110</b> to convert image data to print data and sends the print data to the printer <b>1</b>. The print data is data in a form that can be interpreted by the printer <b>1</b>, and includes various command data and pixel data Pix (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) as liquid ejection data. Command data is data for ordering the printer <b>1</b> to execute a specific operation. Among the command data is, for example, command data that orders the supply of paper, command data that indicates a carry amount, and command data that orders the discharge of paper. Moreover, the pixel data Pix is data about pixels of the image to be printed, and corresponds to each of the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0102">Here, “pixels” refers to unit regions that constitute the image, for example, a region indicated by one cell in a grid defined virtually on a paper S. Images are made by forming dots in these pixels. The pixel data of the print data is data relating to the dots that are formed on the paper S, for example, data indicating whether or not a dot is to be formed in a target pixel. In the present embodiment, in order to facilitate description of the invention, the pixel data Pix of the print data is constituted by 1-bit data. That is, the pixel data Pix is a data value [0] corresponding to no dot or a data value [1] corresponding to a dot. Here the printer expresses gradations by a technique such as dithering. It should be noted that the pixel data of the image data before conversion to print data is 256-gradation RGB data or CMYK data. Although the pixel data Pix is 1-bit data in the present embodiment, it is also possible to use two bits such as, for example, a data value [00] corresponding to no dot, a data value [01] corresponding to a small dot, a data value [10] corresponding to the formation of a medium dot, and a data value [11] corresponding to a large dot, or a number of bits greater than this. In this case, the pixel data indicates gradation values to be expressed by dots to be formed in target pixels.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0104">The printer <b>1</b> is provided with a paper carrying mechanism <b>20</b> for carrying a medium such as paper, a carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b> for moving a carriage <b>36</b> having nozzles n, a head unit <b>40</b> mounted on the carriage <b>36</b>, detector groups <b>50</b> for detecting the condition of the printer, a printer-side controller <b>60</b> for controlling the printer, and a drive signal generation circuit <b>70</b>. It should be noted that in this embodiment the printer-side controller <b>60</b> and the drive signal generation circuit <b>70</b> are provided in a common controller substrate <b>65</b>. Furthermore, the head unit <b>40</b> has a data processing section <b>44</b>, a head drive section <b>45</b> as a drive section, and a print head <b>41</b>. Since the carriage <b>36</b> is provided such that it can move relative to the printer main unit in which the controller substrate <b>65</b> is provided, the controller substrate <b>65</b> and the head nit <b>40</b> are connected by a flat flexible cable (hereinafter referred to as “FFC”) <b>66</b>.</p>

The paper carrying mechanism <b>20</b> has a paper supply roller <b>21</b>, a carry motor <b>22</b>, a carry roller <b>23</b>, a platen <b>24</b>, and a discharge roller <b>25</b>. The paper supply roller <b>21</b> is a roller for delivering the paper S that has been inserted into a paper insertion opening into the printer <b>1</b>, and in this example has a cross-sectional shape that resembles the letter D. The carry motor <b>22</b> is a motor for carrying the paper S in the carrying direction, and its operation is controlled by the printer-side controller <b>60</b>. The carry roller <b>23</b> is a roller for carrying the paper S that has been delivered by the paper feed roller <b>21</b> up to a printable region. The operation of the carry roller <b>23</b> also is controlled by the carry motor <b>22</b>. The platen <b>24</b> is a member that supports the paper S that is subjected to printing from the rear side of the paper S. The discharge roller <b>25</b> is a roller for carrying the paper S for which printing has ended.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0107">The carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b> is for moving the carriage <b>36</b> to which the head unit <b>40</b> is attached in the carriage movement direction. The carriage movement direction includes the direction of movement from one side to the other side and the direction of movement from that other side to the one side. It should be noted that because the head unit <b>40</b> includes the print head <b>41</b>, the carriage movement direction corresponds to the movement direction of the print head <b>41</b>, and the carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b> corresponds to a head movement section that moves the print head <b>41</b> in the movement direction. The carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b> has a carriage motor <b>31</b>, a guide shaft <b>32</b>, a timing belt <b>33</b>, a drive pulley <b>34</b>, and a driven pulley <b>35</b>. The carriage motor <b>31</b> corresponds to the drive source for moving the carriage <b>36</b>. The operation of the carriage motor <b>31</b> is controlled by the printer-side controller <b>60</b>. The drive pulley <b>34</b> is attached to the rotation axis of the carriage motor <b>31</b>. The drive pulley <b>34</b> is disposed on one end side in the carriage movement direction. The driven pulley <b>35</b> is disposed at the other end side in the carriage movement direction on the side opposite the drive pulley <b>34</b>. The timing belt <b>33</b> is connected to the carriage <b>36</b> and is extended between the drive pulley <b>34</b> and the driven pulley <b>35</b>, The guide shaft <b>32</b> supports the carriage <b>36</b> in a manner that permits movement thereof.

<p id="h-0017" num="0000">&lt;Regarding the Printer-Side Controller <b>60</b>&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0119">The printer-side controller <b>60</b> performs control of the printer <b>1</b>. The printer-side controller <b>60</b> has an interface section <b>61</b>, a CPU <b>62</b>, a memory <b>63</b>, and a control unit <b>64</b>. The interface section <b>61</b> sends and receives data to and from the computer <b>110</b> which is an external device, The CPU <b>62</b> is a computing processing device for carrying out overall control of the printer <b>1</b>. The memory <b>63</b> is for securing, for example, a region for storing the programs of the CPU <b>62</b> and a working region, and is constituted by a memory device such as a RAM, EEPROM, or ROM. The CPU <b>62</b> controls various control targets in accordance with computer programs stored on the memory <b>63</b>. For example, the CPU <b>62</b> controls the paper carrying mechanism <b>20</b> and the carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b> via the control unit <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0120">The CPU <b>62</b> also outputs head control signals for driving the head <b>41</b> to the data processing section and the head drive section <b>45</b>, and outputs control signals for causing the generation of drive signals COM to the drive signal generation circuit <b>70</b>. The head control signals include the data take-in clock HCK, pixel data string HD, and a latch signal LAT, for example. Further, the control signal for causing generation of the drive signal COM is a DAC value for example, and is information for indicating a voltage of the drive signal outputted from the drive signal generation circuit <b>70</b> and is updated at a very short update cycle.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">&lt;Regarding Transfer and Conversion Processing of Data&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0121">The print data PD that is outputted from the computer <b>110</b> to the printer <b>1</b> is serial data in which for example a plurality of pixel data Pix for forming an image on printing paper or the like is arranged in an order that is printable by the printer <b>1</b>. This serial data is associated with the nozzle groups N by the printer-side controller <b>60</b> and pixel data for the number of nozzles (here 96 nozzles) that each of the nozzle groups N possesses is arranged in the order in which the nozzles are arranged. The amount of these pixel data Pix is the number of bits required for a one-time ejection cycle, that is, the number of bits is the number of nozzles × the number of nozzle groups. To transfer these pixel data as the pixel data string HD, which is a single signal line, the leading item of data of each nozzle group is sent in the order of, for example, the nozzle group NC, the nozzle group NK, the nozzle group NM, and the nozzle group NY, and then the second item of data of each nozzle group is sent in the order of the nozzle group NC, the nozzle group NK, the nozzle group NM, and the nozzle group NY. This procedure is repeated as many times as there are nozzles. Accordingly, the pixel data Pix that is associated with the nozzle groups N and corresponds to the number of nozzles possessed by the nozzle groups N is arranged in the order in which the nozzles are arranged as a predetermined order and between the pixel data Pix that is associated with a predetermined nozzle group, for example the cyan nozzle group NC, one each of the pixel data Pix associated with the magenta nozzle group NM, the yellow nozzle group NY, and the black nozzle group NK are arranged in a prearranged order and constitute a pixel data string HD as a liquid ejection data string.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram for describing a process in which the pixel data string HD that has been transferred is converted to data for each nozzle row. In the following description, individual items of the pixel data Pix are indicated as follows. Namely, the pixel data corresponding to the cyan nozzle group is referred to as C<b>1</b> to C<b>96</b>, the pixel data corresponding to the magenta nozzle group is referred to as M<b>1</b> to M<b>96</b>, the pixel data corresponding to the yellow nozzle group is referred to as Y<b>1</b> to Y<b>96</b>, and the pixel data corresponding to the black nozzle group is referred to as K<b>1</b> to K<b>96</b>. As shown in the diagram, the pixel data string HD has 96 items of pixel data Pix each, corresponding to each of the nozzle groups and is data arranged in the order, for example, C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, K<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, Y<b>2</b>, K<b>2</b>, . . . , C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, K<b>96</b>. That is to say, in this example, between each of the 96 items of pixel data associated with the cyan nozzle group NC there is one item each of pixel data associated with the magenta nozzle group NM, the yellow nozzle group NY, and the black nozzle group NK arranged in the order of magenta, yellow, black.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart for describing a flow of data.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0124">Since the pixel data string HD generated by the printer-side controller <b>60</b> is serial multiplexed data, it is transferred to the data processing section <b>44</b> of the head unit <b>40</b> using a single core wire of the FFC <b>66</b> that connects the controller substrate <b>65</b> and the head unit <b>40</b> (S<b>10</b>). At this time, the data take-in clock HCK is also outputted from the printer-side controller <b>60</b> to the data processing section <b>44</b>, and this indicates the timing by which pixel data is taken in at the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the data processing section <b>44</b>. It should be noted that a LAT pulse is generated before commencing a new transfer, and the data that has already been transferred to the SR <b>46</b> is latched in the LAT <b>47</b> and the data processing section <b>44</b> is initialized.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0125">Then, the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the data processing section <b>44</b> takes in three consecutive items of pixel data Pix from the leading item of pixel data C<b>1</b> of the pixel data string HD that is outputted from the printer-side controller <b>60</b> synchronized with the rising edge and the falling edge of the data take-in clock HCK (S<b>20</b>). That is, three items of pixel data are taken in at the rising and falling edges of a single pulse of the data take-in clock HCK and the rising edge of the next pulse. The items of pixel data Pix taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>at this time are the first items of pixel data C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, and Y<b>1</b> respectively associated with the cyan nozzle group NC, the magenta nozzle group NM, and the yellow nozzle group NY.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0126">The three items of pixel data C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, and Y<b>1</b> that have been taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>are latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>with the timing by which the fourth item of pixel data K<b>1</b> is taken in synchronized with the data take-in clock HCK (S<b>30</b>). That is, the fourth item of pixel data K<b>1</b> is latched without passing through the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0127">The four items of pixel data C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, and K<b>1</b> that are latched are held in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>until the timing of the next latching in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b</i>, that is, until edges of the take-in clock HCK for the number of nozzle groups are outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0128">At this time, the printer-side controller <b>60</b> discerns whether or not the pixel data that has been taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>is the final data (S<b>40</b>). Then, when the pixel data Pix taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>is discerned as not being the final data, then the pixel data Pix of the pixel data string HD is successively taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>synchronized respectively with the rising edge and the falling edge of the data take-in clock HCK (S<b>20</b> to S<b>40</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0129">On the other hand, after the first four items of the pixel data C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, and K<b>1</b> have been latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b</i>, and when the next four items of the pixel data C<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, Y<b>2</b>, and K<b>2</b> are to be taken in, the pixel data C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, and K<b>1</b> are taken in to the first shift register <b>46</b> of the head drive section <b>45</b> with the timing by which the second item of pixel data M<b>2</b> is taken in, specifically, at the first falling edge of the data take-in clock HCK (S<b>50</b>). That is, a rising edge of an output clock SCK is generated as a predetermined clock signal with the timing of the first falling edge of the data take-in clock HCK, and the pixel data C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, and K<b>1</b> that are being latched are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> synchronized with this output clock SCK. At this time, each of the elements of the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>are associated with a different head drive section <b>45</b> and the four items of the pixel data C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, and K<b>1</b> that have been taken into the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>are taken into first shift registers <b>46</b>C, <b>46</b>M, <b>46</b>Y, and <b>46</b>K possessed by respectively associated head drive sections <b>45</b>C, <b>45</b>M, <b>45</b>Y, and <b>45</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0130">The timing for taking in the pixel data Pix of the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>to the first shift register <b>46</b> is prescribed by the output clock SCK that is outputted at each first falling edge of the two pulses of the data take-in clock HCK outputted after the pixel data Pix is latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b</i>. The output clock SCK is generated in a clock conversion section <b>44</b><i>c </i>of the data processing section <b>44</b> based on the data take-in clock HCK. Here, the timing for taking in the pixel data Pix of the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>to the first shift register <b>46</b> is not necessarily limited to the first falling edge of the data take-in clock HCK, but since SI-C, M, Y, K which are the output of the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>are exchanged at the second falling edge of the data take-in clock HCK, the timing of the second falling edge is preferable for having the longest time interval from the timing of the pixel data switching and a high probability for obtaining stable data.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0131">Furthermore, after the second three items of the pixel data C<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, and Y<b>2</b> are taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the data processing section <b>44</b> (S<b>20</b>), the three items of the pixel data C<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, and Y<b>2</b> that have been taken in and the K<b>2</b> that has been outputted in the pixel data string HD are latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>with the timing by which the fourth item of pixel data K<b>2</b> is taken in synchronized with the data take-in clock HCK, that is, at the falling edge of the data take-in clock HCK outputted after the three items of pixel data are taken into the second shift register (S<b>30</b>). Then, the second four items of the pixel data C<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, Y<b>2</b>, and K<b>2</b> that are latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>are taken in (S<b>50</b>) to the first shift register <b>46</b> of the head drive section <b>45</b> with the timing by which the second item of pixel data M<b>3</b> is taken in when the next four items of the pixel data C<b>3</b>, M<b>3</b>, Y<b>3</b>, and K<b>3</b> are to be taken in, that is, synchronized to the output clock SCK as a predetermined clock signal.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0132">In this manner, the serial data of the pixel data string HD is outputted from the printer-side controller <b>60</b> to the data processing section <b>44</b>, taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>synchronized with the data take-in clock HCK, and latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>with the timing by which the fourth item of the pixel data Kx (x is a variable) is taken in. Then, the four items of the pixel data Cx, Mx, Yx, and Kx that are latched are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> of the head drive section <b>45</b> synchronized with the output clock SCK when the next four items of the pixel data Cx+1, Mx+1, Yx+1, and Kx+1 are taken in.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0133">Then, three items of the pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, and Y<b>96</b> of the final four items of the pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> in the pixel data string HD are taken into the second shift register <b>44</b><i>a </i>synchronized with the data take-in clock HCK (S<b>20</b>), and the four items of the pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> are latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>with the timing by which the fourth item of the pixel data K<b>96</b> is taken in (S<b>30</b>). Then, after this data in the pixel data string HD is not needed, but the data take-in clock HCK continues to be outputted. The final four items of the pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> of the head drive section <b>45</b>, synchronized with the output clock SCK as a predetermined clock signal that changes with the timing of the falling edge of a first pulse P<b>0</b> in the data take-in clock HCK outputted after being latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>(S<b>50</b>) At this time, all the 96 items of the pixel data Pix of the pixel data string HD corresponding respectively to the nozzle groups have been taken into the first shift register <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0134">When all the pixel data Pix of the pixel data string HD are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> of the head drive section <b>45</b>, the printer-side controller <b>60</b> stops output of the data take-in clock HCK when the output clock SCK which has become the timing by which the final pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> of the pixel data string HD is taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> has been outputted (S<b>60</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0135">For this reason, in the present embodiment, after the final pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> of the pixel data string HD is taken into the first shift register <b>46</b>, that is, after the ninety-sixth output clock SCK has been output, output of the data take-in clock HCK is stopped. Here, the timing for stopping the output of the data take-in clock HCK is set to after the ninety-sixth output clock SCK has been outputted in order to ensure that the pulse P<b>0</b> for generating the output clock for taking in the ninety-sixth items of pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> to the first shift register <b>46</b> is outputted, and to return the level of the data take-in clock HCK to a LOW level to prepare for outputting the next data take-in clock HCK.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0136">Then, the 96 items of the pixel data Pix respectively taken into the first shift registers <b>46</b>C, <b>46</b>M, <b>46</b>Y, and <b>46</b>K are latched all together in drive section-side latching circuits <b>47</b>C, <b>47</b>M, <b>47</b>Y, and <b>47</b>K synchronized with the latch signal LAT outputted from the printer-side controller <b>60</b>. The 96 items of pixel data that are respectively latched in the drive section-side latching circuits <b>47</b>C, <b>47</b>M, <b>47</b>Y, and <b>47</b>K are associated with the nozzles n<b>1</b> to n<b>96</b> respectively, and switches <b>48</b>C, <b>48</b>M, <b>48</b>Y, <b>48</b>K are turned on/off in response to the latched pixel data such that ink is ejected appropriately by applying the drive signal COM outputted from the drive signal generation circuit <b>70</b> to the target piezo elements <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0137">With the printing system <b>100</b> and the printer <b>1</b> and the like of the present embodiment, the data take-in clock HCK from the printer-side controller <b>60</b> continues to be outputted even after the final items of the pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> in the pixel data string HD are latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>, and after these final items of the pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b>, output of the data take-in clock HCK is stopped before a pulse P<b>1</b> of the next data take-in clock HCK is outputted. Thus, because the output clock SCK is not outputted as a predetermined clock signal after the final items of the pixel data C<b>96</b>, M<b>96</b>, Y<b>96</b>, and K<b>96</b> in the pixel data string HD are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b>, the data latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>at this time is not taken into the first shift register <b>46</b>. That is to say, even if any data is latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>after the final items of the pixel data Pix in the pixel data string HD are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b>, that latched data cannot betaken into the first shift register <b>46</b>. Thus, the pixel data Pix of the pixel data string HD is taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> until the final items of data without excess or deficiency and data after this is not taken in, and therefore it is possible to take into the first shift register <b>46</b> only the appropriate pixel data Pix. Accordingly, ink is ejected appropriately and excellent images are printed based on the appropriate pixel data Pix that is taken into the first shift register <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0138">The present embodiment was described using an example in which the output of the data take-in clock HCK is stopped when the output clock SCK, which becomes the timing by which the four items of pixel data latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>are taken into the first shift register, is outputted, but the timing for stopping the output of the data take-in clock HCK is not limited to this. That is, the output clock SCK, which is the timing for taking in the four items of pixel data latched in the latching circuit <b>44</b><i>b </i>to the first shift register <b>46</b>, is outputted synchronized with the first falling edge of the data take-in clock RCK outputted after the four items of pixel data to be taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> are latched, and therefore output of the data take-in clock HCK may be stopped using any timing as long as it is in the interval after the four items of latched pixel data are taken into the first shift register <b>46</b> and before the falling edge of the second pulse P<b>2</b> is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0139">Furthermore, the printer-side controller <b>60</b> provided on the printer main unit side and the data processing section <b>44</b> mounted on the carriage <b>36</b> arranged movably relative to the printer main unit are connected by the FFC <b>66</b>, but as described above the pixel data Pix is transferred as serial multiplexed data between the printer-side controller <b>60</b> and the data processing section <b>44</b> and is configured so as to be converted to serial data for each drive section at the data processing section <b>44</b> of the carriage <b>36</b> side. Accordingly, it is possible to output from the printer-side controller <b>60</b> the pixel data (SI-C, SI-M, SI-Y, and SI-K) to be outputted to the plurality of nozzle groups N respectively using a single core wire. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the width of the FFC <b>66</b> that connects the printer-side controller <b>60</b> and the data processing section <b>44</b> and the printer <b>1</b> can be made more compact. Also, because an FFC <b>66</b> with a small number of core wires can bend easily, it is possible to reduce the burden incurred when the carriage <b>36</b> moves, and therefore the carriage <b>36</b> can be moved smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0140">The present embodiment was described having a nozzle group provided for each color of ink and the nozzle rows arranged in single rows. However, the nozzle groups are not limited to this and there may be a plurality of nozzle rows and it is possible to handle a plurality of nozzles associated with a single head drive section as a single nozzle group.</p>
