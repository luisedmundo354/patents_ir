<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/746,412, filed Dec. 24, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,144,020, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to transportable service carts, of the type commonly used for the convenient storage and transportation of items.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Service carts of the described type come in a variety of shapes and sizes that are typically tailored to a specific application or for use with particular items. They usually comprise a storage compartment and a plurality of wheels. The storage compartment may also comprise surfaces and/or shelves that provide a support surface for the stored items and may comprise drawers, cabinets, or other components that may completely enclose the stored items. The plurality of wheels is provided for convenient transport of the service cart.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One application for a service cart is in automotive repair facilities, wherein the service cart stores a technician's tools. The service cart may be transported to the approximate area that the technician is working, typically near a vehicle, to provide convenient access to the stored tools. Occasionally, a service cart will strike a vehicle while the vehicle is in the automotive repair facility, which is undesirable because such impacts between the service cart and vehicle may damage the exterior of the vehicle or the service cart and may damage the internal components of the vehicle or the stored items in the service cart. Repair facility equipment may also come into contact with the service cart on occasion. Such equipment may comprise shelving, vehicle lift systems, or other machinery that may also be damaged if impacted by a service cart.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The damage to the struck object or the service cart is typically caused by the extremities of the cart, such as the corners of the cart, protruding shelves, protruding handles, or the like. The extremities of the cart are most likely to come into contact with other objects, and the extremities often define relatively sharp features, such as a non-radiused corner or a corner with minimal curvature. Such sharp features concentrate the impact on the struck object during the impact, which increases the amount of damage to the object rather than dispersing the impact over a larger area and reducing the damage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore a need exists for a transportable service cart that reduces or prevents damage to struck objects and the service cart when the service cart impacts other objects. A further need exists for a transportable service cart that reduces the likelihood of impacts between a service cart and other objects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention addresses the above needs and achieves other advantages by providing a transportable service cart that comprises a generally box-like frame having four vertical corners that extend from a bottom portion of the service cart to a top portion to define a height of the service cart. A storage component is mounted within the frame. Alternatively, the service cart comprises a storage compartment without a frame, such that the storage compartment defines the vertical corners of the service cart. A plurality of wheels is joined to the bottom portion of the service cart so that the service cart is transportable. At least one protective bumper is attached to overlie an outer side of at least one vertical corner and extend along at least a substantial portion of the height of the service cart. Accordingly, when the service cart strikes another object, the protective bumpers are more likely to engage the other object such that the impact is dampened and dispersed to reduce or prevent damage to the struck object or service cart.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The protective bumpers of the present invention advantageously are a blow molded material, such as polyethylene, and may define indicia to identify the manufacturer or retailer of the service cart. Fasteners or adhesives may be used to attach the protective bumpers to the corners of the storage compartment. In addition, the service cart may also comprise a push handle on a side of the service cart, wherein the push handle may comprise an overmold that comprises a gripping surface and defines indicia.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An alternative service cart of the present invention, which may or may not comprise the protective bumpers on the vertical corners of the service cart, comprises slidably mounted drawers in the storage compartment. The drawers define at least one recess in a front surface of the drawer such that the recess defines a recessed surface. A drawer handle, such as a bar type handle or extruded handle, is attached to the recessed surface of the drawer. The drawer handle advantageously does not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface of the drawer. If the protective bumpers are provided, the drawer handle advantageously does not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front face of the flanking protective bumpers. The service cart also comprises a plurality of wheels joined to the bottom portion of the service cart so that the service cart is transportable. Accordingly, objects struck by the service cart of the present invention are less likely to impact the drawer handles of the service cart, which not only reduces the number of impacts between the service cart and other objects, but also prevents the concentration of the impact on the relatively small surface of the handle. Therefore, the service cart with the recessed drawer handles reduces or prevents damage to the other object and the service cart.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Service carts of further embodiments may define recesses defining generally hexagonal shapes or elliptical shapes into which the bar type drawer handle is attached. Alternatively, the extruded drawer handle may be attached to a recessed surface that substantially extends along the longitudinal length of the drawer so that the extruded handle substantially extends along the longitudinal length of the drawer. The drawer handles may also define indicia on a surface of the handles opposite the gripping surface of the respective handles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the present invention provides a service cart with protective bumpers and/or recessed drawer handles so that damage to a struck object or the service cart is reduced or prevented when the service cart impacts another object.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a service cart <b>10</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The service carts of the illustrated embodiments are preferably tool carts for storing tools used for servicing automotive vehicles. The service cart advantageously comprises drawers and other features for storage of hand tools and automotive specialty tools, as well as other items commonly stored or supported by tool carts in repair facilities. Service carts of further embodiments of the present invention may comprise carts of any shape or any size specifically designed for use with alternative applications or for storage of different items.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The service cart <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a generally box-like frame <b>12</b> and a plurality of wheels <b>14</b>. The frame <b>12</b> extends vertically from a bottom portion <b>16</b> of the service cart to a top portion <b>18</b> of the service cart to define a height of the generally box-like frame, which in the illustrated embodiment is the height of the service cart <b>10</b>. The frame <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> advantageously defines a vertical height of 30 to 40 inches, though service carts of further embodiments of the present invention may define any vertical height. The frame <b>12</b> of the illustrated embodiment generally defines the outermost portions of the service cart <b>10</b>, such as the vertical corners and horizontal corners, as described more fully below. The bottom portion <b>16</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> generally defines the lowermost portion of the service cart and comprises the bottom surface of the service cart. Likewise, the top portion <b>18</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> generally defines the uppermost portion of the service cart.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The service cart <b>10</b> of the illustrated embodiments comprises a storage compartment <b>19</b> that is mounted within the frame <b>12</b>. The storage compartment <b>19</b> advantageously comprises at least one slidably mounted drawer <b>20</b>. The drawers <b>20</b> are slidably mounted through an opening in a front panel of the storage compartment <b>19</b> in a conventional manner. The frame <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a tray <b>22</b> located in the bottom portion <b>16</b> of the frame, and the storage compartment <b>19</b> may comprise additional storage areas, such as a top shelf <b>24</b> enclosed by the side panels of the storage compartment and a top lid <b>26</b> pivotally connected to one of the panels. The top lid <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> defines the top surface of the service cart <b>10</b>. The storage compartment <b>19</b> generally defines interior storage areas; however, the storage compartment may comprise generally exterior features such as a flange <b>28</b> that define at least one orifice <b>30</b> for the placement of items, such as prybars and screwdrivers, generally on the exterior of the storage compartment. The flange <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> extends outward from a side panel of the storage compartment <b>19</b> and defines a generally horizontal surface that extends from a front of the storage compartment to the back of the storage compartment. However, the flange <b>28</b> advantageously does not extend beyond the protective bumpers of the present invention. The storage compartment of further embodiments of the service cart may comprise additional storage areas or features.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The bottom portion <b>16</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> defines a bottom surface <b>32</b> of the service cart, which is generally opposite the top lid <b>26</b>. The bottom portion <b>16</b> and the top portion <b>18</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> define the horizontal corners of the service cart <b>10</b> on the bottom and top, respectively, of the cart. The frame <b>12</b> also comprises four supports <b>34</b> that define the vertical corners <b>35</b> of the service cart and that extend from the bottom surface <b>32</b> of the service cart to the top lid <b>26</b> of the storage compartment <b>19</b> to define the height of the service cart. The vertical corner <b>35</b> of the service cart, which is located on the support <b>34</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, defines a right angle and advantageously overlies the intersections of the panels of the storage compartment <b>19</b>. The front panel <b>36</b> and the back panel <b>38</b> of the storage compartment <b>19</b> are preferably parallel to each other and orthogonal to the parallel left panel <b>40</b> and right panel <b>42</b> of the storage compartment, such that the storage compartment defines a generally box-like shape with right angles. The intersections of the front panel <b>36</b> and the left and right panels <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, as well as the intersections of the back panel <b>38</b> and the left and right panels, define the intersections <b>44</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The panels <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>42</b> define a rectangular enclosure of the storage compartment <b>19</b> which is mounted to the inside surfaces of the supports <b>34</b> of the illustrated embodiment during fabrication of the service cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The supports <b>34</b> of the frame <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> extend vertically from the bottom surface <b>32</b> of the service cart to the top lid <b>26</b> of the storage compartment <b>19</b>. The storage compartment <b>19</b> is suspended above the tray <b>22</b> to define an opening for storage of items. Further embodiments of the present invention may comprise storage compartments that vertically extend the entire height of the service cart such that the storage compartment defines the bottom and the top portions of the cart. Such further embodiments may not require the supports of the frame, such that the intersections of the panels of the storage compartment would define the vertical corners of the service cart. Accordingly, the storage compartment of the further embodiments is fabricated or assembled to comprise the supports, vertical corners, and top and bottom portions of the service cart. Still further embodiments of the present invention may include a frame and storage compartment of alternative shapes or sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to the transportable service cart <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the plurality of wheels <b>14</b> is joined to the bottom surface <b>32</b> of the service cart. Further embodiments of the service cart may comprise a plurality of wheels joined to any surface or panel of the bottom portion <b>16</b> of the storage compartment such that the service cart is transportable. The plurality of wheels <b>14</b>, which in the illustrated embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> comprises four wheels, enables the service cart <b>10</b> to be conveniently rolled around such that a technician using the items stored in the service cart may conveniently move the service cart to be proximate the area that the technician is working, such as near a vehicle in an automotive repair facility. The plurality of wheels <b>14</b> advantageously comprises wheels, rollers, casters, or the like that define a locking feature to keep the service cart <b>10</b> in a fixed location when the locking feature is actuated. The plurality of wheels of further embodiments of the invention may comprise any rolling device or other device that provides for convenient transport of the service cart.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Because the vertical corners <b>35</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> are the most likely portions of the service cart <b>10</b> to contact another object, the present invention provides protective bumpers <b>46</b> attached to at least one support <b>34</b> to reduce the impact between the service cart and the struck object (not shown). The protective bumpers <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> overlie an outer side of each vertical corner <b>35</b> of the service cart <b>10</b>. The outer side of each vertical corner <b>35</b> of the illustrated embodiment comprises the surfaces of the support adjacent the vertical corner and the surface defining the vertical corner. The outer side of the vertical corner <b>35</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> defines a curved corner surface and two linear surfaces that are tangential to the vertical corner <b>35</b>. Further embodiments of the service cart may define an outer side of the vertical corner with alternative surfaces that define any relative orientations and distances. Moreover, the outer side of the vertical corner of alternative embodiments of the present invention may define only the curved corner surface or one or more linear surfaces so long as the vertical corner is protected by the overlying protective bumper from impacts from multiple directions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the protective bumper <b>46</b> of the present invention preferably comprises two front faces <b>48</b> and a rounded face <b>50</b>. The front faces <b>48</b> each overlie the linear surfaces tangential to the vertical corner <b>35</b>, while the rounded face <b>50</b> overlies the curved corner surface of the vertical corner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the forward facing front faces <b>48</b> of the two protective bumpers <b>46</b> attach to the front vertical corners <b>35</b> of the service cart <b>10</b>, such that the two protective bumpers flank the drawers <b>20</b>. The two forward facing front faces <b>48</b> of the flanking protective bumpers <b>46</b> flank the drawers <b>20</b> such that the front faces are located on either side of the drawers <b>20</b>. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> define a bumper depth, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, from the respective panel of the storage compartment <b>19</b>, such as the front panel <b>36</b>, to the front face of the protective bumper, such as the forward facing front face <b>48</b> of the flanking protective bumper. In the illustrated embodiments of the present invention, the front panel <b>36</b> of the storage compartment <b>19</b> is in substantially the same plane as the front surfaces of the drawers <b>20</b> in a slidably closed position. Accordingly, the bumper depth also defines the perpendicular distance from the front surface of the drawer <b>20</b> in a slidably closed position to the forward facing front faces <b>48</b> of the flanking protective bumpers <b>46</b>. The bumper depth in embodiments of the service cart <b>10</b> with vertical supports <b>34</b> may include the thickness of the vertical support in the bumper depth, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Advantageously, the bumper depths of the two front faces <b>48</b> of the flanking protective bumpers <b>46</b> are equivalent. However, the front faces of further embodiments of the protective bumpers may define any relative bumper depths. The rounded face <b>50</b> advantageously defines a radius that is preferably greater than or equal to the radius of the vertical corner <b>35</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> which the protective bumper <b>46</b> overlies, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In addition, the rounded face <b>50</b> advantageously defines a thickness that is equal to or greater than the bumper depth of the front faces <b>48</b>. Further embodiments of the present invention may comprise a rounded face having any relative radius, or no radius at all, and having any relative thickness. In addition, protective bumpers of still further embodiments may each comprise only two front faces attached proximate to the vertical corner of the service cart, wherein the front faces define bumper depths sufficient to protect the vertical corner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The protective bumper <b>46</b> advantageously defines a hollow portion <b>52</b> between an outside surface of the protective bumper and the vertical corner <b>35</b> of the service cart <b>10</b>, such that the hollow portion is between two layers of the protective bumper <b>46</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or the hollow portion is between a single layer of the protective bumper, which is the outside surface of the protective bumper, and the vertical corner of the service cart. The hollow portion <b>52</b> reduces the amount of material required to manufacture the protective bumpers <b>46</b>, thus reducing the cost of the protective bumpers, and provides more flexibility to the protective bumper, which improves the deflection and absorption of an impact between the service cart <b>10</b> and a struck object. The hollow portion <b>52</b> advantageously extends within the front faces <b>48</b> and the rounded face <b>50</b> to define one hollow portion along a cross section of the protective bumper <b>46</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Further embodiments of the service cart may comprise protective bumpers with hollow portions of different shapes or with no hollow portion, such as the protective bumper shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The protective bumper <b>46</b> of the illustrated embodiment is attached to the service cart <b>10</b> with fasteners <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the protective bumper <b>46</b> comprises orifices <b>56</b> that can be aligned with through holes <b>58</b> in the support <b>34</b> and storage compartment <b>19</b> such that the fastener <b>54</b> can pass through the orifice and through holes to be threaded into a nut <b>60</b> on the inside of the storage compartment. The protective bumper <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is fastened through each front face <b>48</b> at equivalent vertical heights; however, further embodiments of the protective bumper may comprise any number or arrangement of fasteners to attach the protective bumpers. Furthermore, the protective bumpers <b>46</b> may be attached with alternative fasteners, such as screws or bolts threaded into threaded holes of the support and/or storage compartment, as well as rivets or snap buttons, to list a few non-limiting examples. Alternative protective bumpers <b>246</b>, such as the bumpers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, may be adhered to the support <b>234</b> with an adhesive applied between a surface opposite the front face <b>248</b> and/or the rounded face <b>250</b> and the vertical corner of the service cart <b>210</b>. Further embodiments of the present invention may attach the protective bumpers in alternative ways; non-limiting examples include joining the bumper material directly onto the storage compartment during the manufacture of the protective bumper or fabricating the storage compartment to retain the protective bumpers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The protective bumpers <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are preferably manufactured from a high density polyethylene (HDPE), or similar flexible material, for improved impact absorption. HDPE is a relatively hard material compared to an elastomer or other soft material, it may be blow molded to form bumpers with various indicia, and it would be more durable and provide a more attractive appearance than some elastomers or other soft materials. The blow molded bumpers could also provide a double wall construction for the hollow portion <b>52</b>, which provides flexibility and absorbs impact energy to avoid or minimize damage to other surfaces. Alternative embodiments may be manufactured from an elastomer material because of its resilience and durability or from other polymer materials or soft metals, such as aluminum, that define a minimum thickness to flex and thereby absorb the energy of an impact with minimal aesthetic damage to the protective bumper. Further embodiments of the service cart <b>10</b> may comprise protective bumpers of alternative material. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> advantageously are capable of flexing and absorbing impacts to reduce damage to the service cart <b>10</b> and struck objects such that the protective bumpers are not plastically deformed. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> are also advantageously manufactured from a material that will not deteriorate with time or exposure to sunlight, certain chemicals, or other environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The protective bumpers <b>46</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> of the present invention are advantageously manufactured by blow molding or thermoforming, which are well known in the art. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> of the illustrated embodiments are advantageously blow molded HDPE, which are blow molded prior to being attached to the service cart <b>12</b>. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> of the illustrated embodiment define indicia <b>62</b> on the front face <b>48</b>, which may be used to indicate the manufacturer or retailer of the service cart <b>10</b> or provide alternative information. The indicia <b>62</b> may protrude outward beyond the front face <b>48</b> or may be recessed in the front face. Advantageously, the molds used to manufacture the protective bumpers <b>46</b> may comprise interchangeable portions so that the indicia <b>62</b> can be edited, replaced, or removed as desired by the manufacturer. The illustrated embodiments define indicia <b>62</b> on the forward facing front faces <b>48</b> on the front panel <b>36</b> of the storage compartment <b>19</b> only; however, further embodiments of the present invention may define indicia on the front faces on the front, left, right, and/or back panels of the storage compartment and/or on the rounded faces of the protective bumpers. In addition, indicia may be defined on the rounded face <b>50</b> of the protective bumper <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Advantageously, the attached protective bumpers <b>46</b> extend along at least a substantial portion of the height of the service cart <b>10</b>, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> to provide protection for the service cart and objects that may be struck by the service cart. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> are not required to extend the entire height from the bottom surface <b>32</b> to the top lid <b>26</b>, but only along a substantial portion of the height. For example, the protective bumpers <b>46</b> extend at least 25% of the height of the service cart <b>10</b>, and more preferably extend at least 50% of the height of the service cart, and even more preferably extend at least 75% of the height of the service cart, thereby extending at least a substantial portion of the height thereof. In further embodiments of the service cart <b>10</b>, the protective bumpers <b>46</b> extend at least along the top portion <b>18</b> of the service cart. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> of the illustrated embodiments overlie a substantial portion of the vertical corners <b>35</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> such that the corners are protected from other objects. The protective bumpers <b>46</b> comprise one protective bumper attached to each vertical corner <b>35</b>, wherein the individual protective bumpers define a generally consistent cross-sectional area, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, without interruptions, other than to provide clearance for the push handle of the service cart, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Protective bumpers of further embodiments of the present invention may comprise two or more individual protective bumpers on a single vertical corner of the service cart. Still further embodiments of the present invention may provide protective bumpers of alternative shapes and arrangements to significantly protect the service cart.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To facilitate the transport of the service cart <b>10</b>, the service cart advantageously comprises a push handle <b>64</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The push handle <b>64</b> of the illustrated embodiments is joined to the supports <b>34</b> of the frame <b>12</b> on sides of the supports that are generally perpendicular to the front panel <b>36</b> of the storage compartment <b>19</b>. The push handle <b>64</b> may alternatively be joined to the left panel <b>40</b> of the storage compartment <b>19</b>, which is also generally perpendicular to the front panel <b>36</b> of the storage compartment. If the service cart <b>10</b> comprises drawers <b>20</b> that define a generally planar front surface <b>66</b> that is generally parallel to the front panel <b>36</b> of the storage compartment, the push handle <b>64</b> extends along a direction that is generally perpendicular to the front surface of the drawers. The push handle <b>64</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an extruded handle that defines two ends <b>68</b> and comprises a bracket <b>70</b> extending from each end of the push handle. The bracket <b>70</b> provides a space between the push handle <b>64</b> and the surface of the service cart <b>10</b>, such as the supports <b>34</b> of the frame <b>12</b>, to which the bracket is joined. The bracket <b>70</b> is advantageously joined to the support <b>34</b> with fasteners, similar to fasteners described for the protective bumper <b>46</b>, or the bracket may be joined by alternative devices. The bracket <b>70</b> may also define indicia <b>62</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Further embodiments of the bracket <b>70</b> may comprise a polymer material joined, either permanently or removably, to the bracket to absorb impacts between the bracket and other objects. Such a bracket <b>70</b> may include an opening such that the indicia <b>62</b> on the bracket are visible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The push handle of the illustrated embodiment comprises an overmold <b>72</b> that is axially inserted over the push handle <b>64</b> before the brackets <b>70</b> are joined to the push handle. An alternative overmold <b>72</b> may be wrapped about the push handle <b>64</b> if the push handle is rigidly joined to the brackets <b>70</b>, which would prevent the axial insertion of an overmold onto the handle. Further embodiments of the push handle may comprise alternative overmolds. The overmold <b>72</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a cushioned gripping surface <b>74</b> for the person pushing the service cart <b>10</b> to grip and may comprise finger grooves on the gripping surface to provide an improved grip on the push handle <b>64</b>. The overmold <b>72</b> is advantageously a polymer material, such as HDPE or an elastomer to list two non-limiting examples, and may define indicia <b>62</b> on the overmold to identify the manufacturer or retailer, or to provide information to the user of the service cart <b>10</b>. Overmolds of further embodiments of the present invention many be manufactured from any material and may define alternative indicia or no indicia.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Because the push handle <b>64</b> defines a surface that projects beyond the protective bumpers <b>46</b> in the illustrated embodiments, the overmold <b>72</b> provides an impact absorbing surface to reduce damage to the service cart <b>10</b> or other object if the push handle strikes another object. The overmold <b>72</b> advantageously extends over the bracket <b>70</b> to cover the outermost surfaces of the bracket, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Further embodiments of the present invention may comprise alternative push handles, recessed push handles that do not extend beyond the protective bumpers, or no push handles.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The service cart <b>10</b> of the present invention also provides recessed drawer handles to reduce or prevent damage caused when the handles of a service cart strike an object. The drawers <b>20</b> of the service cart <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> comprise recesses <b>76</b> that define a generally hexagonal shape. The recess comprises six sides that may be angled or generally perpendicular to the front surface <b>66</b> of the drawers <b>20</b> and that advantageously comprise radiused intersections of the six sides. Further embodiments of the recesses may include alternative hexagonal shapes or may define non-hexagonal shapes. The recess <b>76</b> further comprises a recessed surface <b>78</b>. The sides of the recess <b>76</b> advantageously join the recessed surface <b>78</b> to the front surface <b>66</b> of the drawer <b>20</b>, wherein the sides may be oriented at any angle relative to the recessed surface and/or front surface of the drawer. The recessed surface <b>78</b> is inwardly offset in a perpendicular direction from the front surface <b>66</b> of the drawers <b>20</b> such that the recess <b>76</b> defines an offset depth “X” in a perpendicular direction from the recessed surface to the front surface of the drawer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Advantageously, the recessed surface <b>78</b> of the illustrated embodiment is generally parallel to the front surface <b>66</b> of the drawers <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A bar type drawer handle <b>80</b> is attached to the recessed surface <b>78</b> to define a recessed drawer handle for the service cart <b>10</b>. The bar type handle <b>80</b> defines a gripping surface <b>82</b> spaced from the recessed surface <b>78</b>. The bar type handle <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> defines a handle depth “Y” from the surface of the handle opposite the gripping surface to the recess surface, which is no greater than the offset depth “X” of the recess <b>76</b> such that the bar type handle extends no further than the front surface of the drawer. Further embodiments of the recess <b>76</b> define an offset depth “X”, or a handle depth “Y” of the bar type handle <b>80</b>, such that the bar type handle does not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front faces <b>48</b> of the flanking protective bumpers <b>46</b>. In such embodiments, the handle depth of the bar type handle <b>80</b> is not greater or substantially greater than the combined distances of the offset depth and the bumper depth, preferably not greater than one inch, and more preferably not greater than one-half inch than the combined distances of the offset depth and the bumper depth. If the service cart comprises a storage cart mounted within a frame, then the bumper depth includes the thickness of the supports <b>34</b> of the frame <b>12</b> and the bumper <b>46</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, if the service cart is fabricated to define the frame, such that the vertical corners of the storage compartment define the vertical corners of the service cart, then the bumper depth would not include the thickness of supports <b>34</b>. A recessed drawer handle <b>80</b> that extends no further than the front surface <b>66</b> of the drawers <b>20</b> or does not extend substantially beyond the front faces <b>48</b> of the flanking protective bumpers <b>46</b> is particularly advantageous when the service cart <b>10</b> is being pushed through a narrow passage where an otherwise protruding drawer handle would strike an object but the recessed drawer handle would not strike the object or would be less likely to strike the object.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The recessed surface <b>78</b> of the recess <b>76</b> is advantageously the innermost surface of the recess, such as the recessed surface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, the recess of further embodiments of the present invention may comprise multiple surfaces of varying perpendicular distances. Non-limiting examples of alternative recessed surfaces include curved surfaces or multifaceted surfaces. In such embodiments, the recessed surface comprises the surface to which the bar type handle is attached such that the offset depth is measured from the front surface of the drawer to the recessed surface, independent of the additional surfaces of the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Bar type handle <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> comprises a gripping surface <b>82</b> that is spaced from the recessed surface <b>78</b> by two standoffs <b>84</b>. The gripping surface <b>82</b> is generally perpendicular to the parallel standoffs <b>84</b> and intersects the standoffs at right angles to define the handle corners <b>86</b>. The standoffs <b>84</b> are attached to the recessed surface <b>78</b> with fasteners (not shown); however, further embodiments of the bar type handles may be attached in alternative ways. The handle depth of the bar type handle <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> is illustrated as “Y” and is the perpendicular distance from the recessed surface <b>78</b> to the surface of the bar type handle opposite the gripping surface <b>82</b>. The surface opposite the gripping surface <b>82</b> is preferably the outermost portion of the handle. The surface opposite the gripping surface <b>82</b> may define indicia <b>62</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> that may be defined in the bar type handle <b>80</b> when the handle is manufactured. Various manufacturing methods may be used to define the indicia and include non-limiting examples such as molding and machining.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates alternative bar type handles <b>180</b> for the service cart <b>110</b>, as well as an alternative shape for the recess <b>176</b>. The bar type handles <b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> define a generally circular cross section and define rounded corners <b>186</b>, as opposed to the non-circular cross section and sharp corners <b>86</b> of the bar type handles <b>80</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>. The gripping surface <b>182</b> of the bar type handles <b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> defines finger grooves to facilitate contact between a user's hand and the gripping surface. Indicia may also be defined on the bar type handle <b>180</b> opposite the gripping surface <b>182</b>. The bar type handles <b>180</b> preferably do not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front faces <b>148</b> of the flanking protective bumpers <b>146</b> and more preferably do not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface <b>166</b> of the drawers <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The recess <b>176</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> defines a generally elliptical shape, as opposed to the generally hexagonal shape of the recess <b>76</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>. Still further embodiments of the present invention may comprise recesses that define alternative shapes. The service cart <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also illustrates the top lid <b>126</b> in an open position to provide access to the top shelf <b>124</b>. The top lid <b>126</b> is pivotally mounted to the back panel <b>138</b> with a hinge <b>190</b> for movement of the top lid between open and closed positions. The top lid <b>126</b> comprises at least one lift assist <b>188</b> defined in the storage compartment <b>119</b>, wherein the top lid in an open position is supported by the lift assist. The lift assists <b>188</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are connected between the storage compartment <b>119</b> and the top lid <b>126</b>. The lift assists of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> connect to a pry bar or screwdriver holder on the top tray <b>124</b> of the storage compartment <b>119</b>; however, lift assists of further embodiments of the present invention may be attached to any surface of the storage compartment. The lift assists <b>188</b>, along with the hinge <b>190</b> about which the top lid rotates, support the top lid <b>126</b> when the lid is inclined in the open position.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a third illustrated embodiment of the service cart <b>210</b> comprises recessed extruded drawer handles <b>292</b> that preferably do not extend beyond or substantially beyond a front surface <b>266</b> of the drawers <b>220</b>, and more preferably do not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front faces <b>248</b> of the flanking protective bumpers <b>246</b>. The drawers <b>220</b> each define a longitudinal length of the drawer, and the recess <b>276</b> substantially extends along the length of a drawer. The extruded handles <b>292</b> of the illustrated embodiment also substantially extend along the longitudinal length of the drawers <b>220</b>. The recess <b>276</b> defines a recessed surface <b>278</b> to which the extruded handle <b>292</b> is attached, preferably with fasteners as described above. Alternatively, the extruded handle may be slidably inserted in a longitudinal direction into a portion of the recess structured and arranged to receive and retain the extruded handle. Further embodiments of the present invention may comprise alternative ways of attaching the extruded handle.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The recessed surface <b>278</b> is inwardly offset from the front surface <b>266</b> of the drawer <b>220</b> to define an offset depth in a perpendicular direction from the recessed surface to the front surface of the drawer. The extruded handle <b>292</b> of the illustrated embodiment defines a handle depth that is no greater than the offset depth of the recessed surface <b>278</b> such that the extruded handle does not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface <b>266</b> of the drawer <b>220</b>. An alternative embodiment of the extruded handle <b>292</b> defines a handle depth that is not greater or substantially greater than a combined distance of the offset depth of the recess <b>276</b> and the bumper depth of the flanking protective bumpers <b>246</b> such that the extruded handle of the slidably closed drawer <b>220</b> does not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers. Preferably the extruded handle does not extend more than one inch beyond the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers <b>246</b>, and more preferably not greater than one-half inch beyond the front faces of the flanking bumpers <b>246</b>. If the service cart comprises a storage cart mounted within a frame, then the bumper depth includes the thickness of the supports <b>34</b> of the frame <b>12</b> and the bumper <b>46</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, if the service cart is fabricated to define the frame, such that the vertical corners of the storage compartment define the vertical corners of the service cart, then the bumper depth may not include the thickness of supports.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The extruded handle <b>292</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> comprises a gripping surface <b>282</b> that is generally bisected in a vertical direction by the standoff <b>284</b> of the extruded handle. The standoff <b>284</b> of the extruded handle <b>292</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> substantially extends along the entire longitudinal length of the extruded handle and is generally perpendicular to the gripping surface <b>282</b> and a surface opposite the gripping surface. Finger grooves are advantageously defined on the gripping surface <b>282</b>. In addition, indicia <b>262</b> are defined opposite the gripping surface in the illustrated embodiment. Further embodiments of the present invention may include extruded handles of alternative shape and longitudinal length.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Still further embodiments of the present invention may comprise bar type drawer handles attached to the recess, such as the recess <b>76</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or recess <b>176</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein the handles are attached to the sides of the recess. The drawer handles are advantageously attached to the sides of the recess with fasteners or the like or may be fabricated with the drawer, such that the drawer handles are securely attached to the drawer. The drawer handles joined to the sides of the recess define a handle depth from the surface of the handle opposite the gripping surface to the recessed surface, wherein the handle depth is not greater or substantially greater than the offset depth of the recessed surface, such that the bar type handles preferably do not extend further than the front surface of the drawers, and more preferably do not extend substantially beyond the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers, if provided. Further embodiments of the drawer handles may include overmolds, similar to the overmold <b>72</b> of the push handle <b>64</b> described above, that are placed on the drawer handles to provide a protective overmold to absorb impacts if the drawer handle strikes another object. The overmold may be axially inserted on the drawer handle, either the bar type or extruded handles, or may be wrapped about the drawer handle. The recessed drawer handles comprising an overmold preferably do not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface of the drawers, and more preferably do not extend beyond or substantially the front face of the protective bumpers, if provided. The overmold of drawer handles that do extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface of the drawers or front faces of the protective bumpers advantageously provides an impact absorbing surface to reduce damage to the service cart or other object if the drawer handle strikes another object. Additional embodiments of the drawer handles may define alternative structures or features.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To manufacture the service cart of the illustrated embodiment, the storage compartment is fabricated and mounted to the generally box-like frame. Alternatively, the storage compartment may be fabricated to define the frame, such that the vertical corners of the storage compartment define the vertical corners of the service cart. The storage compartment advantageously is fabricated to include shelves, drawers, lids, and/or the like as required. A plurality of wheels is joined to the bottom portion of the frame or storage compartment so that the service cart is transportable. The protective bumpers are attached to the vertical corners of the service cart, advantageously by fasteners, adhesives, or the like as described above. The protective bumpers extend vertically along at least a substantial portion of the height of the service cart and may define indicia.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For the embodiments of the service cart that comprise drawers with recessed handles, the drawers comprising the recesses are slidably mounted within the storage compartment before or after the handles have been attached to the recessed surfaces of the drawers. Either bar type handles or extruded handles may be attached to the drawers, and are preferably fastened to the drawers. The handles preferably define a handle depth that is not substantially greater than the combined distance of the offset depth from the recessed surface to the front surface of the drawer and the bumper depth from the front surface of the drawer to the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers, such that the handles do not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers. More preferably, the handles define a handle depth that is not greater than or substantially greater than the offset depth such that the handles extend no further than the front surfaces of the drawers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The service cart of the present invention eliminates protruding handles while providing a bar type handle or extruded handle to open the drawers of the service cart. Such recessed bar type or extruded handles are preferred to alternative drawer handles that are less convenient to grip or to apply a pulling force to open the drawer. The lack of protruding drawer handles reduces the likelihood of the handles contacting other objects during transportation of the service cart and the amount of damage to the handles or other objects if contact does occur. The push handle advantageously comprises a protective overmold to minimize the impact between the push handle and other objects that may contact the push handle. Likewise, the protective bumpers at the corners of the storage compartment minimize the impact between the service cart and other objects that may contact the service cart, thus reducing the amount of damage to each.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.
