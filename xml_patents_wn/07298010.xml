<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A composite transistor is disclosed for use in radiation hardening a CMOS IC formed on an SOI or bulk semiconductor substrate. The composite transistor has a circuit transistor and a blocking transistor connected in series with a common gate connection. A body terminal of the blocking transistor is connected only to a source terminal thereof, and to no other connection point. The blocking transistor acts to prevent a single-event transient (SET) occurring in the circuit transistor from being coupled outside the composite transistor. Similarly, when a SET occurs in the blocking transistor, the circuit transistor prevents the SET from being coupled outside the composite transistor. N-type and P-type composite transistors can be used for each and every transistor in the CMOS IC to radiation harden the IC, and can be used to form inverters and transmission gates which are the building blocks of CMOS ICs.</p>

<?GOVINT description="Government Interest" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to radiation hardening of integrated circuits (ICs), and more particularly to a radiation-hardened composite transistor which can be used to radiation harden complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs) to suppress single-event transients.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Radiation hardening of ICs against single-event transients is becoming increasingly important as device sizes become smaller and smaller, and as clock speeds become faster and faster. A single-event transient (SET) is a disturbance in an IC produced by an energetic particle (e.g. an ion, proton, neutron) impinging on a sensitive node in the IC and depositing sufficient charge to create a transient signal therein. The sensitive nodes of a CMOS circuit are the drain-body reverse-biased junctions of the “OFF” transistors. When an energetic particle impinges on the drain-body reverse-biased junction in an “OFF” transistor, it generates electrons and holes which are collected by the junction. This can produce a transient signal which can temporarily switch the “OFF” transistor to an “ON” state. As a result, the transient signal can change the state of a flip-flop, latch or memory cell formed by that transistor, thereby creating erroneous data in the IC and producing a single-event upset (SEU). The transient signal can also be propagated in the IC to affect the state of other logic elements therein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A number of schemes have been proposed and implemented to mitigate the effects of SETs and SEUs in digital circuits. These schemes are briefly discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Spatial redundancy utilizes additional circuits to detect and/or correct SEU errors caused by SETs. This scheme, which includes the use of replicated storage cells and voting schemes, can require a significant increase in circuit complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Temporal redundancy is based on sampling an input multiple times before it is stored in a register. If the duration of a signal is less than a predetermined pulse width, the signal is assumed to be a SET or noise, and is ignored by the register. This scheme has been effective for hardening against SETs which are generated external to the register, but can be ineffective for a SET produced inside the register. Additionally, as CMOS devices become smaller and faster, they become more sensitive to SETs with the SETs having a pulse width comparable to the pulse width of the logic signals propagating in the IC. As a result, this scheme is expected to become less effective for smaller and faster transistors, or else the operating frequency of the ICs will need to be limited to allow effective filtering of the SET signal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Filtering is based on the use of feedback circuits which are added to registers to slow down their response time. As a result the registers do not respond to signals, external or internal, faster than a predetermined response time. This scheme imposes a space penalty due to the substrate space required for the feedback circuits; and it also imposes a speed penalty due to the response time set by the feedback circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">SET reduction schemes are based on the use of processing techniques to reduce charge generation and collection in semiconductor material produced by energetic particle strikes. For example, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS transistors have a much smaller cross section compared with bulk CMOS transistors and thus are less sensitive to SETs. High-energy, high-dose implants can also be used for CMOS transistors to reduce the charge collection from an energetic particle strike. The use of SET reduction schemes can be difficult to implement for ICs fabricated in a foundry since it requires that the foundry's processing techniques must be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">SET suppression schemes eliminate transient signal propagation when a SET occurs instead of mitigating the effects of the SET. SET suppression schemes have been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,175,605; 6,278,287; 6,794,908; and in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0007743. The SET suppression schemes known heretofore are less than satisfactory due to a number of factors including the existence of alternate current paths that can allow propagation of SETs around a protected transistor, the existence of certain elements of a circuit (e.g. transmission gates) which remain unprotected against SETs, the inapplicability of these SET suppression schemes to circuits formed with bulk CMOS transistors, and the inapplicability of these SET suppression schemes to circuits formed with body-tied SOI transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a radiation-hardened composite transistor which overcomes the limitations of the prior art.</p>

The composite transistor comprises a circuit transistor of an n-type or p-type having a source terminal, a drain terminal, a gate terminal and a body terminal; and a blocking transistor of the same n-type or p-type also having a source terminal, a drain terminal, a gate terminal and a body terminal. The gate terminals of the circuit and blocking transistors are connected together to form a gate terminal for the composite transistor. The source terminal of the circuit transistor forms a source terminal for the composite transistor; and the drain terminal of the blocking transistor forms a drain terminal for the composite transistor. The source terminal of the blocking transistor is connected to the drain terminal of the circuit transistor. The body terminal of the circuit transistor forms a body terminal for the composite transistor. The body terminal of the blocking transistor is connected to the source terminal of the blocking transistor and is electrically isolated from any other connection point (i.e. node) in the CMOS IC.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The composite transistor can further include a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate wherein the circuit and blocking transistors are formed, with the SOI substrate having a buried oxide layer sandwiched between a monocrystalline silicon body and a monocrystalline silicon layer. In some embodiments of the present invention, the circuit transistor and the blocking can be formed within a common island defined within the monocrystalline silicon layer with the island being surrounded by a field oxide for electrical isolation. The bodies of the circuit and blocking transistors can be separated and electrically isolated from each other by a common drain/source region which forms a drain for the circuit transistor and a source for the blocking transistor. In other embodiments of the present invention, the circuit transistor and blocking transistor can be formed in separate islands defined within the monocrystalline silicon layer, with each island being surrounded by a field oxide for electrical isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet other embodiments of the present invention, the composite transistor can further include a bulk semiconductor substrate (e.g. a silicon substrate) wherein the circuit transistor and the blocking transistor are formed. The bulk semiconductor substrate can comprise a p-type-doped substrate having a separate n-type-doped well wherein each p-type composite transistor is formed, and further having a separate p-type-doped well wherein each n-type composite transistor is formed, with each p-type doped well being located within another n-type-doped well to electrically isolate each p-type-doped well from the p-type-doped substrate. Alternately, the bulk semiconductor substrate can comprise an n-type-doped substrate having a separate p-type-doped well wherein each n-type composite transistor is formed, and further having a separate n-type-doped well wherein each p-type composite transistor is formed, with each n-type-doped well being located within another p-type-doped well to electrically isolate each n-type-doped well from the n-type-doped substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a schematic diagram of a radiation-hardened composite transistor <b>10</b> of the present invention which can be used to form a radiation-hardened complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC). The composite transistor <b>10</b> comprises a circuit transistor <b>12</b> and a blocking transistor <b>14</b> connected together as shown. Each circuit transistor <b>12</b> and blocking transistor <b>14</b> can be a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor. The term “MOS transistor” as used herein is intended to include transistors having gates formed of a metal, a metal alloy, or polycrystalline silicon (also termed polysilicon).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the circuit transistor <b>12</b> further comprises a source terminal <b>16</b>, a drain terminal <b>18</b>, a gate terminal <b>20</b> and a body terminal <b>22</b>. The blocking transistor comprises another source terminal <b>24</b>, another drain terminal <b>26</b>, another gate terminal <b>28</b> and another body terminal <b>30</b>. The gate terminals <b>20</b> and <b>28</b> are connected together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to form a gate terminal G for the composite transistor <b>10</b>. The source terminal <b>16</b> forms a source terminal S for the composite transistor <b>10</b>; and the drain terminal <b>26</b> forms a drain terminal D for the composite transistor <b>10</b>. The body terminal <b>22</b> of the circuit transistor <b>12</b> also forms a body terminal B for the composite transistor <b>10</b>. The body terminal <b>30</b> of the blocking transistor <b>14</b> is connected to the source terminal <b>24</b> thereof and is electrically isolated from any other connection point (also termed a node) in a CMOS IC wherein the transistor is used. According to the present invention, the body terminal <b>30</b> of the blocking transistor <b>14</b> is never connected to the body terminal <b>22</b> of the circuit transistor <b>12</b> through a direct or resistive interconnection, or to any other resistor, capacitor or transistor in the CMOS IC since this would provide a current path for a transient current to flow around the blocking transistor <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a p-type circuit transistor <b>12</b> and a p-type blocking transistor <b>14</b> to form a p-type composite transistor <b>10</b>, a similar circuit arrangement can be used to form an n-type composite transistor <b>10</b>′ as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> using an n-type circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ and an n-type blocking transistor <b>14</b>′. In the p-type and n-type composite transistors, <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the body terminal B of the composite transistors can be tied to the source S thereof, or to a reference potential (e.g. V<sub>dd </sub>or V<sub>ss</sub>). In other embodiments of the present invention, the body terminal B can be omitted from each transistor <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The p-type and n-type composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′, respectively, are useful for radiation hardening CMOS ICs to mitigate against single-event transients (SETs). To radiation-harden any type of CMOS IC against SETs according to the present invention, each and every transistor in the IC will preferably be replaced by the composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ of the present invention. When the CMOS IC to be radiation-hardened contains a transmission gate, a one-way or two-way transmission gate as described hereinafter can be substituted for the transmission gate in the CMOS IC. If this is done, then any SET that is produced within the circuit transistor or blocking transistor of one of the composite transistors <b>10</b> or <b>10</b>′ in the CMOS IC will be blocked from propagating to the output of that composite transistor <b>10</b> or <b>10</b>′ so that the CMOS IC will be unaffected by SETs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">This can be understood by analyzing the performance of an inverter circuit <b>50</b> formed from a p-channel (i.e. p-type) composite transistor <b>10</b> and an n-channel (i.e. n-type) composite transistor <b>10</b>′ as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic diagram of the inverter <b>50</b>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B show schematic cross-section views of the circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ and the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ to show the location of a drain-body junction <b>32</b> which is sensitive to an impinging energetic particle <b>100</b> when the transistors <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ are in an “OFF” state for which the drain-body junction <b>32</b> is reverse-biased. The drain-body junction <b>32</b> in each transistor <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ is located at the interface between an N+ doped drain and a P doped body of these transistors <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the impinging energetic particle <b>100</b> is shown as an arrow which shows the path of the energetic particle <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the energetic particle <b>100</b> (e.g. an ion, proton or neutron) is shown impinging on the drain-body junction <b>32</b> of the n-type circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ when the input of the inverter <b>50</b> is “LOW” (i.e. approximately equal to V<sub>SS</sub>). With a “LOW” input, the n-type composite transistor <b>10</b>′ is turned “OFF” and the p-type composite transistor <b>10</b> is turned “ON” to provide a “HIGH” state for the output of the inverter <b>50</b>. In this state of the inverter <b>50</b>, the energetic particle <b>100</b> impinging on the reverse-biased drain-body junction <b>32</b> of the n-type circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ will produce charges (i.e. electrons and holes) on either side of the junction <b>32</b> that result in a transient voltage source V<sub>SET </sub>being formed across the junction <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a conventional inverter having only a single n-type transistor and a single p-type transistor connected in series, the transient voltage V<sub>SET </sub>produced by an impinging energetic particle <b>100</b> could result in a relatively large transient current I<sub>SET </sub>that can temporarily pull down the “HIGH” output of the inverter to the “LOW” state, thereby producing a single-event transient (SET) which can be propagated to other circuits to which the inverter output is connected, thereby producing a single-event upset (SEU).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present invention, however, the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> will effectively suppress the transient current I<sub>SET </sub>since the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ will be turned “OFF” by the “LOW” input of the inverter <b>50</b>. In the “OFF” state, the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> provides a very high source impedance (e.g. &gt;100 MΩ) in series with the transient voltage V<sub>SET </sub>as compared with a very low V<sub>dd </sub>source impedance of transistors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> which are turned “ON” by the “LOW” input of the inverter <b>50</b>. The very high source impedance of the “OFF” blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> will reduce the transient current I<sub>SET </sub>to a very small value of approximately zero (i.e. I<sub>SET</sub>˜0). As a result, the small value of the transient current I<sub>SET </sub>will be unable to pull down the “HIGH” output of the inverter <b>50</b> so that the inverter output will remain “HIGH” with a value approximately equal to V<sub>dd </sub>as determined by the transistors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> which are both turned “ON”. Thus, although the SET occurs in the circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the SET will be prevented from reaching the output of the inverter <b>50</b> due to the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′. Eventually, the charges produced by the SET will recombine within the circuit transistor <b>12</b>′. The output of the inverter <b>50</b> and any other circuit connected thereto will thus be unaffected by the SET, thereby contributing to the radiation hardening of the inverter <b>50</b> against SETs.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> schematically illustrates the situation when the energetic particle <b>100</b> impinges on the drain-body junction of the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ which is in the “OFF” state when the input of the inverter <b>50</b> is “LOW” (i.e. ˜V<sub>ss</sub>). In this case, the charge produced by the energetic particle <b>100</b> similarly produces a transient voltage source V<sub>SET </sub>across the reverse-biased drain-body junction <b>32</b> of the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Since the circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is also in the “OFF” state, the circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ will provide a very high source impedance (e.g. &gt;100 MΩ) compared to the “ON” transistors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>; and this will again reduce the transient current I<sub>SET </sub>to a very small value I<sub>SET</sub>˜0. Again, since transient current I<sub>SET </sub>is nearly zero, it will be unable to affect the output of the inverter <b>50</b> which will remain “HIGH”. There is no alternative low-impedance path to V<sub>ss </sub>for the transient current I<sub>SET </sub>to flow since the body terminal <b>30</b> of the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ is only connected to its source <b>24</b>. Eventually, the electrons and holes produced by the energetic particle will recombine within the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In both cases above, there is no current path around the circuit transistor/blocking transistor pair that would allow the inverter output to be perturbed from its expected “HIGH” state. Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the body (labelled “P”) of the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ is tied only to the source (labelled “N”) of the blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ and not to any other node in the inverter <b>50</b> or to any voltage reference (e.g. V<sub>ss</sub>) or to any node in any other circuit that would provide a low-impedance current path so that a substantial transient current could reach the output of the inverter <b>50</b> to perturb its state.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the input to the inverter is “HIGH” (i.e. approximately equal to V<sub>dd</sub>) and the p-type circuit and blocking transistors, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, are turned “OFF”, then the effect of a SET on these transistors must be considered. In this case, which is similar to that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, when either one of the circuit and blocking transistors, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, experience a SET due to an incident energetic particle <b>100</b>, the other transistor <b>14</b> or <b>12</b> in the p-type composite transistor <b>10</b> provides a very high source impedance in the “OFF” state which will limit the transient current I<sub>SET </sub>to being near zero. This very small value of the transient current I<sub>SET</sub>˜0 will not alter the “LOW” output of the inverter <b>50</b> which is set by the n-type circuit and blocking transistors <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ being switched “ON”. As a result, the effect of the SET will be mitigated; and the output of the inverter <b>50</b> will remain unchanged in the “LOW” state with a voltage of about V<sub>ss</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The p-type and n-type composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ of the present invention can be used to form any type of CMOS IC known to the art. This can be done simply by substituting a composite transistor <b>10</b> or <b>10</b>′ for each transistor of the same type in a conventional CMOS IC. This will be advantageous since then each and every transistor within the resulting CMOS IC will be protected against SETs. This is also advantageous over other known schemes which try to mitigate against SETs since these other schemes leave certain types of circuits such as transmission gates unprotected against SETs.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">That the present invention is also applicable to protect transmission gates against SETs can be seen from the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a body-tied one-way transmission gate <b>60</b> formed according to the present invention; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a body-tied two-way transmission gate <b>70</b> formed according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the body-tied one-way transmission gate <b>60</b> is formed by connecting the source terminals S of a p-type composite transistor <b>10</b> and an n-type composite transistor <b>10</b>′ together to form an input for the transmission gate <b>60</b>; and by connecting the drain terminals D of the composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ together to form an output for the transmission gate <b>60</b>. The body B of each composite transistor <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ is tied to the source S thereof so that the input signal will provide a well-defined reference voltage for each body B.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The body-tied one-way transmission gate <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is enabled to transmit a signal provided to the input in the direction indicated by the horizontal arrow when complementary control signals Ā and A are applied to the gates G of the composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′. The complementary control signals Ā and A allow each composite transistor <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ to be turned “ON” or “OFF” together. When the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ are both “OFF”, the input signal is blocked. When the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ are both “ON”, the input signal is transmitted to the output, with “HIGH” or positive values of the input signal being transmitted through the p-type composite transistor <b>10</b> to the output, and with “LOW” or negative values of the input signal being transmitted through the n-type composite transistor <b>10</b>′ to the output.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To form a body-tied two-way transmission gate <b>70</b>, two body-tied one-way transmission gates <b>60</b> can be connected together in opposite directions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The SOI substrate <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> comprises a buried oxide layer <b>36</b> sandwiched between a monocrystalline silicon body <b>38</b> and a monocrystalline silicon layer <b>40</b>. Each circuit transistor <b>12</b> and <b>12</b>′ and each blocking transistor <b>14</b> and <b>14</b>′ can be fabricated in the monocrystalline silicon layer <b>40</b> using a series of well-known semiconductor IC processing steps which define a source <b>42</b>, a drain <b>44</b>, a gate <b>46</b> and a body <b>48</b> for each transistor.

This can be done, for example, by extending the body <b>48</b> of each transistor beneath the source <b>42</b> thereof and using an ion implantation step to form a heavily p- or n-doped region on a side of the source <b>42</b> opposite the body <b>48</b> as described in U.S. Pat.

This p- or n-doped region electrically connects the source <b>42</b> to the body <b>48</b> thereby forming the transistors <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>′, <b>14</b> and <b>14</b>′ as body-tied transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other embodiments of the present invention, certain of the transistors <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>′, <b>14</b> and <b>14</b>′ in some of the composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ can be formed as body-tied transistors on the SOI substrate <b>34</b> while the transistors in other composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ in the CMOS IC <b>90</b> can be left untied (i.e. with the transistor body <b>48</b> not being electrically connected to the source <b>42</b> thereof).

Generally providing each transistor <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>′, <b>14</b> and <b>14</b>′ as a body-tied transistor is to be desired since there can be undesirable effects due to threshold voltage level variations and other radiation susceptibilities when the bodies of these transistors are left untied.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">During fabrication of each transistor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, a trench can be etched down through the monocrystalline silicon layer <b>40</b> about each transistor being formed to define the island <b>52</b> in the monocrystalline silicon layer <b>40</b>. A field oxide <b>54</b> (e.g. comprising silicon dioxide or a silicate glass such as TEOS deposited from the decomposition of tetraethylortho silicate) can then be deposited to fill in the trench and surround each island <b>52</b>, thereby separating and electrically isolating the body <b>48</b> of each transistor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ from the body of an adjacent transistor in the CMOS IC <b>90</b>. Since the body <b>48</b> of each transistor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ is electrically isolated in its own island <b>52</b> by the surrounding field oxide <b>54</b> and also by the underlying buried oxide layer <b>36</b> there can be no substrate current path for a transient current I<sub>SET </sub>to reach any other transistor in the CMOS IC <b>90</b>.

For each composite transistor <b>10</b> or <b>10</b>′, a common drain/source region <b>58</b> is used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> to form the source for the blocking transistor <b>14</b> or <b>14</b>′ and the drain for the circuit transistor <b>12</b> or <b>12</b>′. Isolation of the body of the circuit transistor <b>12</b> or <b>12</b>′ from the blocking transistor <b>14</b> or <b>14</b>′ can be provided by extending the common drain/source region <b>58</b> completely across the common island <b>56</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The composite transistors <b>10</b> and <b>10</b>′ of the present invention can also be used to fabricate the CMOS IC <b>90</b> on a bulk semiconductor substrate <b>62</b> which comprises silicon or germanium. This is schematically illustrated in the cross-section view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> for a p-type-doped bulk semiconductor substrate <b>62</b>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> for an n-type-doped bulk semiconductor substrate <b>62</b>. Each circuit transistor <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>′ and each blocking transistor <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>′ is preferably formed as a body-tied transistor (i.e. with the body terminal being connected to the source terminal of that transistor) when a bulk semiconductor substrate is used. The term “bulk semiconductor substrate” as used herein refers to a semiconductor wafer comprising a monocrystalline semiconductor material (e.g. monocrystalline silicon), and is intended to include an epitaxially-grown semiconductor layer of the same semiconductor type as the remainder of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the bulk semiconductor substrate <b>62</b> is p-type-doped (e.g. by ion implanting or thermally diffusing a p-type dopant such as boron), the source <b>42</b> and drain <b>44</b> of each p-type circuit transistor <b>12</b> and each p-type blocking transistor <b>14</b> are formed in a separate n-type-doped well <b>64</b> (e.g. doped n-type with ion implanted or thermally diffused phosphorous) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. The n-type-doped wells <b>64</b> electrically isolate the p-type circuit and blocking transistors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> from the p-type-doped substrate <b>62</b> by forming a reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction at the interface of the n-type-doped well <b>64</b>, which forms the body of each transistor <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, and the p-type-doped substrate <b>62</b>. The n-type-doped wells <b>64</b> also serve to electrically isolate the bodies of the circuit and blocking transistors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> from each other and from any other transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc., in the CMOS IC.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, each n-type circuit transistor <b>12</b>′ and each n-type blocking transistor <b>14</b>′ is also formed in a separate p-type-doped well <b>66</b> (e.g. doped p-type with boron). However, since the p-type-doped wells <b>66</b> are of the same polarity as the p-type-doped substrate <b>62</b>, the p-type-doped wells <b>66</b> are electrically connected to the p-type-doped substrate <b>62</b>. To remedy this situation and provide electrical isolation to prevent any transient current I<sub>SET </sub>produced in the drain-body junction <b>32</b> of the n-type transistors <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ from being conducted through the substrate <b>62</b>, the p-type-doped wells <b>66</b> are located inside another n-type-doped well <b>68</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.

Another reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction is also formed between the n-type-doped well <b>68</b> and the p-type-doped substrate <b>62</b>.

The p-type-doped wells <b>66</b> can be formed, for example, by ion implanting boron into the n-type-doped substrate <b>72</b>. The sources <b>42</b> and drains <b>44</b> of the transistors <b>12</b>′ and <b>14</b>′ can then be formed by ion implanting an n-type-dopant (e.g. phosphorous) into the wells <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The p-type circuit and blocking transistors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are formed in n-type-doped wells <b>64</b> which are further located within another p-type-doped well <b>74</b> which can be electrically connected to V<sub>ss </sub>to form a reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction between the body of each transistor <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, which is formed from one of the n-type-doped wells <b>64</b>, and the p-type-doped well <b>74</b>.
