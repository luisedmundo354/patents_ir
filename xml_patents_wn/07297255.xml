<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to mass transfer or energy transfer modules that are sanitary and are easy to replace and install. More particularly, the present invention relates to a mass transfer or energy transfer module formed from a mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge, a reusable bowl, a reusable manifold, and a reusable connecting device to connect the mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge, reusable bowl and manifold together.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of modules are utilized to effect mass transfer or energy transfer between two fluids. Representative modules include a degasser where one fluid comprises a liquid containing a gas while the other fluid is a gas at subatmospheric pressure wherein the two fluids are separated by a gas permeable membrane. Another such module is a gasification device wherein one fluid is a gas at superatmospheric pressure and the second fluid is a liquid in which the gas is soluble wherein the fluids are separated by a gas permeable membrane. A third module is a heat exchanger wherein a hot fluid and a cool fluid are separated by a nonpermeable heat conducting material. The mass transfer or energy transfer module can comprise a manifold, a bowl for housing one fluid and a cartridge for housing a second fluid. Thus, when constructing the mass transfer or energy transfer module, the cartridge and the bowl are separately secured to and sealed to the manifold head. In addition, upon completion of mass transfer or energy transfer, the bowl and cartridge are separately removed from the head. This separate removal requires that the bowl be moved a distance substantially greater than the entire length of the cartridge thereby exposing the cartridge to permit its removal. Thereafter, the exposed cartridge is removed by hand or with a hand tool. Since the bowl must be moved the length of the cartridge, the space within which the bowl and cartridge are positioned must accommodate this removal step.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,572, to provide a filter assembly which cooperates with a bowl to produce a filter cartridge-bowl construction which can be demounted as a single unit from a manifold. This filter assembly is not used for mass transfer or energy transfer between two fluids. It is used to filter a fluid. The filter cartridge is connected to the bowl by bayonet connections on the cartridge which fit into grooves within the interior surface of the bowl. The bayonet connections are formed integrally with the cartridge such as by being molded as a single unit. When the cartridge is so-configured, it can only be used with a bowl configured to accept the bayonet. This is undesirable since it prevents the so-configured cartridge to be used with presently produced bowls configured to not accept this cartridge. This, in turn, severely reduces the market for the so-configured cartridge. In addition, the bayonet connections are positioned below the top surface of the cartridge so that they fit into grooves in the bowl also positioned below the top surface of the cartridge. When the bayonets are so-positioned, positioning in the grooves is made more difficult by the reduced visibility.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a mass transfer or energy transfer medium or cartridge which permits its use in a plurality of bowls of different configurations. In addition, it would be desirable to provide such a cartridge which includes a connection means between the cartridge and a bowl with means that are not movable relative to the cartridge during mass transfer or energy transfer utilizing two fluids. In addition, it would be desirable to provide such a cartridge having a connection means which are clearly visible so that connection of the cartridge to the bowl is facilitated. Such a cartridge would promote ease of inserting the filter cartridge into the bowl, and would reduce the space required to install the mass transfer or energy transfer module.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with this invention, a mass transfer or energy transfer module is provided comprising a manifold, and the combination of a mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge and bowl wherein the cartridge and bowl are locked together to be installed and removed as one piece from the manifold. The cartridge comprises a mass transfer or energy transfer medium sealed at both ends with an end cap. One of the end caps includes at least two flanges and a fluid passageway for fluid communication between the manifold and the interior of the cartridge. The flanges extend outwardly from the end cap and beyond an outside vertical surface of the mass transfer or energy transfer medium. The flanges are designed to fit into slots in the bowl thereby to effect connection of the cartridge to the bowl. The flanges on the end cap which secure the cartridge to the bowl permit the cartridge and bowl to be removed as one piece from the manifold. The end cap can be bonded to an end of a cartridge of any construction so that the cartridge can be secured to a bowl. In another aspect of this invention, a bowl is provided which has a collar having at least two slots which accommodate the flanges of the end cap. The bowl and collar can be unitary construction or can be formed from two separate pieces which can be joined such as with screw threads.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides a mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge and a mass transfer or energy transfer module formed of a manifold, the mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge and a bowl. The manifold provides fluid pathways for a first fluid feed into the cartridge, optional first fluid removal from the cartridge and a second fluid feed and a second fluid removal from the bowl. Fluid removal from either the cartridge or the bowl is effected through the manifold. Fluid feed can be introduced into the cartridge through the manifold either from the outside of the cartridge or from within the interior of the cartridge. In any event, sealing is provided to prevent admixture of the first fluid and the second fluid without mass or energy passing through the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge and bowl are constructed so that they are sealed with the manifold or removed from contact with the manifold as one piece. The cartridge is sealed with two end caps, at least one of which is provided with a fluid passageway. One of the end caps has a fluid passageway and at least two flanges formed integrally therewith. The fluid passageway can function as an inlet or outlet of the cartridge. The flanges are configured to effect locking of the cartridge to the top portion of the bowl. Since the flanges are positioned above the mass transfer or energy transfer medium, the cartridge can be secured to the top portion of the bowl having a larger diameter than the body of the bowl fluid blockage by the flange is less than that when the flanges are positioned between the cartridge and the body of the bowl. Subsequent to a use of the cartridge, the bowl and cartridge are removed from the manifold as a single piece rather than two pieces. Since the bowl and cartridge are removed together, the cartridge need not be removed from the manifold in a separate step. Thus, a space substantially equal to the sum of the length of the cartridge and the length of the bowl together need not be provided to remove the mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge from the manifold. Only a space as long as substantially the length of the bowl need not be provided. This permits one to install a mass transfer or energy transfer of this invention within a smaller space as compared to the space required with present mass transfer or energy transfer modules. In addition, since the cartridge is removed with the bowl, it need not be handled by a worker either by hand or with a hand tool. This substantially reduces the possibility of contacting fluid within the bowl with a worker. The bowl optionally can contain a drain for removing fluid before removal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a mass transfer module <b>10</b> comprises a manifold <b>12</b>, a bowl <b>14</b> having an inlet <b>9</b> and a mass transfer cartridge <b>16</b>. Mass transfer cartridge <b>16</b> can be a membrane such as a pleated membrane which is gas permeable. Such a mass transfer cartridge can be used as a degasser for liquids or as a gas contactor for effecting dissolution of a gas in a liquid. Suitable membranes are formed from poly (tetrafluoroethylene-co-perfluoro (alkylvinyl ether)) (PFA) or poly (tetrafluoralethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene (FEP) such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,294 which is incorporated herein by reference. Such membranes are useful to remove dissolved gases from liquids, “degassing” or to add a gaseous substance to a liquid. For example, ozone is added to very pure water used to wash semiconductor wafers. A threaded ring <b>18</b> is positioned on the outside surface <b>20</b> of bowl <b>14</b> and is retained thereon by bead <b>22</b> which extends around the circumference of the bowl <b>14</b> and lip <b>24</b>. By controlling the size and flexibility of bead <b>22</b>, the ring <b>18</b> can be slipped over the bead <b>18</b> to position the ring <b>18</b> or the bead <b>22</b> can be formed on the bowl <b>14</b> after the ring <b>18</b> is positioned as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The ring <b>18</b> is substantially fixed in its position relative to the bowl <b>14</b>, i.e., it cannot move any substantial distance along the length of the bowl <b>14</b>. When its threads <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are drawn together, the ring <b>18</b> carries or drives the cartridge <b>16</b> into affirmative contact with manifold <b>12</b> to effect sealing with O-rings <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>. Conversely, when the ring <b>18</b> is rotated so as to drive the threads <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> apart, the cartridge <b>16</b> is positively carried or driven away from the manifold <b>12</b>. Sealing of the bowl <b>14</b> to the abutting manifold <b>12</b> is effected by O-rings <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>. The bowl is moved into contact with the manifold <b>12</b> vertically without rotating the bowl <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The cartridge <b>16</b> is connected to bowl <b>14</b> by flanges <b>15</b> on end cap <b>30</b> which mate with slots <b>32</b> in collar <b>34</b>. The collar <b>34</b> is threaded into bowl <b>14</b> by threads <b>36</b>. The collar <b>34</b> extends about the entire inner circumference of bowl <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the bowl and collar can be formed of one piece in the shape of bowl <b>14</b> and the collar <b>34</b> such as by molding. End cap <b>30</b> including fluid passageway <b>42</b> is sealed to manifold <b>12</b> by O-rings <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>. The fluid passageway <b>42</b> sealed to the end cap <b>30</b> provides fluid communication to an open interior <b>23</b> within the elongated medium of the cartridge <b>16</b>. Since flanges <b>15</b> do not extend about the entire circumference of the end cap <b>30</b>, fluid is capable of by-passing the end cap <b>30</b> to flow into or from the manifold <b>12</b>. When module <b>10</b> is utilized as a degasser, a vacuum is drawn at inlet <b>44</b> and the liquid to be degassed in introduced through inlet <b>9</b> and is removed through passageways <b>8</b> and outlet <b>46</b>. When module <b>10</b> is used to introduce gas into a liquid, superatmospheric gas enters inlet <b>44</b> and liquid enters inlet <b>9</b> and is removed though outlet <b>46</b>. The structure of the collar <b>34</b> will be more fully described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, module <b>17</b> includes a manifold <b>19</b>, a cartridge <b>21</b> and a bowl <b>25</b>. The cartridge <b>21</b> is connected to bowl <b>25</b> by flanges <b>27</b> with collar <b>32</b> on bowl <b>25</b>. The cartridge <b>21</b> has a first end <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The first end <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the cartridge <b>21</b> is sealed to an end cap <b>15</b><i>a </i>having fluid passageway <b>33</b>. The second end <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the cartridge <b>21</b> is sealed to an end cap <b>15</b><i>b </i>having a fluid passageway <b>33</b><i>b</i>. Passageway <b>33</b> is connected to inlet <b>35</b>. Passageway <b>33</b> is connected to the lumens of a plurality of hollow fibers <b>37</b> made from a nonporous heat conductive material such as stainless steel or from a chemically compatible polymer. A first fluid can be introduced through inlet <b>35</b> into hollow fibers <b>37</b> and then out of cartridge <b>21</b>, through outlet <b>39</b>. A second fluid can be introduced through inlet <b>41</b> onto the outside surfaces of hollow fibers <b>37</b> and then through outlet <b>43</b>. The module <b>17</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be utilized to effect heat exchange between two fluids. The thread <b>26</b> and lip <b>24</b> function to interact with a rotatable ring (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the same manner as described above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An optional gas vent <b>44</b> can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the invention include a mass transfer or energy transfer cartridge which comprises an elongated medium capable of effecting mass transfer therethrough or for effecting energy transfer from a first fluid to a second fluid. Embodiments are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. For example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the elongated medium <b>37</b><i>a </i>has a first end <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>21</b><i>b</i>, a first sealing plate <b>15</b><i>a </i>sealed to the first end <b>21</b><i>a</i>, a second sealing plate <b>15</b><i>b </i>having a fluid passageway <b>33</b><i>b </i>sealed to the second end, a fluid passageway <b>33</b> sealed to the first sealing plate <b>15</b><i>a </i>to provide fluid communication to an open interior <b>23</b> within the medium <b>37</b><i>a</i>, and the first sealing plate <b>15</b><i>a </i>having at least two flanges <b>27</b> which extend beyond an outer surface <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the medium <b>37</b><i>a</i>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>the medium is a pleated membrane <b>37</b><i>a</i>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>the medium comprises a plurality of porous hollow fiber membranes <b>37</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, the elongated medium <b>37</b><i>b </i>has a first end <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>21</b><i>b</i>, a first sealing plate <b>15</b><i>a </i>sealed to the first end <b>21</b><i>a</i>, a second sealing plate <b>15</b><i>b </i>having a fluid passageway <b>33</b><i>b </i>sealed to the second end, a fluid passageway <b>33</b> sealed to the first sealing plate <b>15</b><i>a </i>to provide fluid communication to an open interior <b>23</b> within the hollow fiber medium <b>37</b><i>b</i>, and the first sealing plate <b>15</b><i>a </i>having at least two flanges <b>27</b> which extend beyond an outer surface <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the medium <b>37</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the medium comprises a plurality of nonporous hollow fibers <b>37</b> formed of a heat conducting material. Another embodiment of the invention is a module <b>17</b> which comprises a manifold <b>19</b>, the elongated medium <b>37</b>, and a bowl <b>25</b> which houses the medium, and means for locking the bowl to the manifold, the at least two flanges <b>27</b> being fit into slots in said bowl to effect connection of said flanges <b>27</b> and said bowl <b>25</b>. In another embodiment the bowl <b>25</b> and the collar <b>32</b> comprises a unitary construction. In another embodiment the first end cap <b>15</b><i>a </i>includes at least one vertical extension, each of the at least one vertical extension being fit into a vertical slot in the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the collar <b>34</b> includes two cutouts <b>41</b> and two vertical extensions <b>43</b>. Each vertical extension <b>43</b> includes a slot <b>32</b> (one not shown). The slots <b>32</b> fit with and accommodate flanges <b>15</b>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) The angle subtended by slots <b>32</b> depend upon the flexibility of the material used to make end cap <b>30</b> and collar <b>34</b>. The slots <b>32</b> subtend an angle of at least about 15 degrees, preferably between about 30 and about 45 degrees when the end cap <b>30</b> and collar <b>34</b> are made of relatively flexible polymer if perfluoro(alkylvinyl ether) (PFA). When the end cap <b>30</b> and collar <b>34</b> are made of relatively rigid polymer material such as polypropylene, these angles can be about one-half that for PFA. This angle size with these exemplary materials provides a desired contact surface between the flanges <b>15</b> and the slots <b>32</b> so that the end cap <b>30</b> is not separated from the collar <b>34</b> during use of the module <b>10</b>. The collar <b>34</b> optionally includes detents <b>45</b> which fit with and accommodate optional vertical extension on the outside surface of flange <b>15</b>. The collar <b>34</b> also includes optional vertical slots <b>17</b> which permit drainage of fluid between the collar <b>34</b> and the manifold <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is inserted into the collar of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by aligning the flanges <b>15</b> with cutouts <b>41</b>. The end cap <b>30</b> and filter cartridge <b>16</b> are then rotated so that flanges <b>15</b> fit into slots <b>32</b> thereby securing the cartridge <b>16</b> to the collar <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a bowl and collar construction of this invention is shown. The collar <b>34</b> is threaded into the bowl <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the collar <b>34</b> and bowl <b>14</b> can be molded as one piece. The bowl <b>14</b> includes a plurality of stops <b>50</b> which support a locking ring <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The bowl <b>14</b> includes an inlet <b>17</b> that can be open or closed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the end cap utilized in this invention has been described with reference to two opposing flanges, it is to be understood that the end cap can be provided with more than two flanges. At least two flanges are required in order to maintain the axial alignment of the cartridge with the bowl. The orientation and angle subtended by the flanges <b>15</b> are such as to permit their insertion into the slots <b>32</b> of collar <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one aspect of this invention, the end cap having flanges is provided with an outside surface configuration which mates with an inside surface configuration of the collar attached to the bowl in order to center the filter cartridge to which it is attached within the bowl. Centering the cartridge within the bowl allows for a smooth mating of the flanges and collar when the flanges are rotated into the collar. The outside surface configuration of the flanges can include a small groove. While this outside surface configuration is not required in this invention, in its absence, the flanges will slide from side to side within the collar thereby increasing difficulty of engaging the flanges and collar.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the end cap <b>70</b> includes a groove <b>72</b> on legs <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> which mates with a surface <b>78</b> of collar <b>80</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a fluid passageway <b>71</b> for fluid communication between a manifold and the interior of a cartridge. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> include bosses <b>82</b>, they are not necessary to the groove's <b>72</b> function. The purpose of the bosses <b>82</b> are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>, the collar <b>84</b> includes two opposing slots <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> into which fit the bosses <b>82</b> when the end cap <b>90</b> is rotated into position into collar <b>84</b>. Expansion of the slots away from each other is caused by contacting the bosses <b>82</b> with the inside surfaces <b>85</b> of the collar <b>84</b>. The distance between the outside surfaces of the bosses <b>82</b> is slightly larger than the distance between opposing inside surfaces <b>85</b> of the collar <b>84</b>. The slots <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> extend through the thickness of the collar <b>88</b>. The slots <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> mate with bosses <b>82</b> on the end caps <b>90</b> to provide an improved fit between the collar <b>84</b> and the end cap <b>90</b>. The bosses are configured to cause portions of the collar <b>84</b> including mating slots <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> to expand outwardly when the end cap <b>90</b> is rotated into position until the bosses <b>82</b> fit into the open slots <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>. At the point of fitting, the opposing inside surfaces <b>85</b> of the collar <b>84</b> contract toward each other and portions of the collar <b>84</b> thus overlap with the bosses <b>82</b> rendering it more difficult for the end cap <b>90</b> to become detached from the collar <b>84</b> during use. The collar <b>84</b> illustrates an inside surface configuration <b>87</b> that can mate with an outside surface configuration of end cap flanges.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an end cap <b>92</b> of this invention comprises a fluid passageway <b>94</b> having O-rings <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. The end cap <b>92</b> includes a plate <b>100</b> having flanges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> with grooves <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> respectively on a lower surface adjacent the filter medium of each of the flanges, the grooves shaped to mate with an inner surface configuration of said collar attached to said bowl. The flanges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> fit into slots of a housing such as slots <b>86</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The flanges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> also are provided with bosses <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> on an outside surface of the flanges <b>104</b> and <b>102</b> respectively which promote securing the end cap <b>92</b> to the collar. The end cap <b>92</b> is secured, such as by bonding to an end of a filter cartridge such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an alternative end cap <b>110</b> of this invention is shown. The end cap <b>110</b> does not include the bosses of the end cap of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The end cap <b>110</b> includes a plate <b>100</b>, flanges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> with grooves <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> respectively on a lower surface adjacent the filter medium of each of the flanges, the groove shaped to mate with an inner surface configuration of said collar attached to said bowl, a fluid passageway <b>94</b> and O-rings <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. The flanges <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> fit into slots of a collar of a bowl such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
