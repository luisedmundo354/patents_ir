<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An automatic smear preparing apparatus includes a sample smearing section for smearing a biological sample on a slide glass by using a spreader glass; a washing section for washing the used spreader glass; and an ultrasonic generating section for applying ultrasound to the washing section.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The biological sample referred to in the present invention includes blood and bone marrow fluid of mammals including human being.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The automatic smear preparing apparatus according to the present invention signifies such an apparatus that automatically performs all the steps of a preparation process including sucking from a sample container a biological sample such as blood contained therein, smearing the sample on a slide glass, staining the smeared sample and carrying the slide glass out.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the present invention, the slide glass may be a commercially available one generally used for microscopes. For example, there can be used a transparent glass plate in a rectangular shape having an area of 26 mm×76 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The sample smearing section is constructed such that the biological sample is dropped onto the slide glass and spread over the surface of the slide glass by using the spreader glass. For example, a quartz glass plate in a square shape having the same width and thickness as the slide glass can be used as the spreader glass.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sample smearing section preferably has a mechanism in which the spreader glass is contacted on the slide glass at an angle of 30°±10° and slid on the slide glass under a predetermined pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The washing section may include a sub-washing section for spraying washing liquid onto the spreader glass and a main washing section for immersing the spreader glass in the washing liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this case, the sub-washing section sprays the washing liquid onto the spreader glass in order to wash and sufficiently wet the spreader glass with the washing liquid. Accordingly, when the spreader glass is immersed in the washing liquid in the main washing section, wettability of the spreader glass is improved to facilitate the washing process in the main washing section. Water or physiologic saline may suitably be used as the washing liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sub-washing section preferably includes two nozzles for discharging the washing liquid onto both surfaces of the spreader glass, respectively, and a shifting section for shifting the two nozzles in parallel with the spreader glass. Thereby, both surfaces of the spreader glass can be washed at the same time and wetted uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The main washing section preferably includes a washing bath for containing the washing liquid and a transferring section for putting the spreader glass in and out of the washing bath.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The transferring section preferably puts the spreader glass in and out of the washing bath in a direction vertical to the washing liquid, which prevents contaminants from redepositing on the spreader glass.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The washing liquid discharged from the nozzles may be received in the washing bath.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ultrasonic generating section is capable of applying ultrasound to any of the spreader glass, the sub-washing section and the main washing section.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The ultrasonic generating section includes an ultrasonic transducer, which may be arranged in the washing bath. The ultrasonic transducer may suitably be placed on the outer surface of the bottom or the side wall of the washing bath. Alternatively, the ultrasonic transducer may be disposed inside the washing bath.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The ultrasonic transducer may be a commercially available one. The transducer generally has a structure in which a piezoelectric element is sandwiched between two electrode plates and an alternating voltage is applied between the electrodes to excite the piezoelectric element in a direction orthogonal to the polarization direction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The ultrasonic generating section may further include a driving section for driving the ultrasonic transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The driving section includes, for example, an a.c. inverter for applying a driving a.c. voltage to the ultrasonic transducer. The ultrasonic transducer utilizing the piezoelectric element is characterized in that the greater the amplitude of the applied a.c. voltage is, the greater the amplitude of the ultrasound becomes. As a result, the generated ultrasound becomes greater. Therefore, if the driving section is provided with the a.c. inverter capable of changing the output voltage, thereby the ultrasound can be adjusted. The ultrasonic transducer preferably has the frequency range of 50 to 80 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The driving section preferably drives the ultrasonic transducer in such a manner that the greater viscosity the biological sample has, the greater the ultrasound that is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, the biological sample adhered to the spreader glass can effectively be washed away in accordance with the viscosity (tackiness) thereof. In the case where the biological sample is blood, the viscosity thereof is determined by the number of erythrocytes, the number of leukocytes, the amount of hemoglobin, the hematocrit value or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this case, the viscosity of the biological sample is preferably obtained by an analyzer which analyzes the biological sample by at least one of an optical analysis method or an electrical analysis method.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The driving section may adjust the ultrasound by intermittently driving the ultrasonic transducer in a predetermined period.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The driving section preferably drives the ultrasonic transducer when the spreader glass is put in the washing bath and stops the transducer when the spreader glass is taken out of the washing bath. This prevents the washing liquid from spilling out of the washing bath due to the ultrasonic energy of the transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the present invention provides an automatic smear preparing apparatus comprising: a sample smearing section for smearing a biological sample on a slide glass by using a spreader glass; a washing section for washing the used spreader glass; and an ultrasonic generating section for applying ultrasound to the washing section, wherein the ultrasonic generating section includes an ultrasonic transducer and a driving section for driving the ultrasonic transducer, the driving section driving the ultrasonic transducer so that the greater the viscosity of the biological sample, the greater the ultrasound that is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Still further, the present invention provides an automatic sample analysis system comprising an automatic sample analyzer for analyzing components of a biological sample and an automatic smear preparing apparatus. It is preferred that the automatic smear preparing apparatus prepares a smear of a biological sample analyzed by the automatic sample analyzer and that the viscosity of the biological sample is calculated by analysis results of the biological sample.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The automatic sample analyzer may include a quantifying section for quantifying the sample and an analyzing section for analyzing the quantified sample by at least one of an optical analysis method and an electrical analysis method.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The control section <b>201</b> receives analysis data from the analyzing section <b>214</b> and analyzes the numbers and the particle sizes of erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets contained in the sample, the hemoglobin concentration and the hematocrit value. Further, the control section <b>201</b> calculates the viscosity of the sample from the analysis results. The output section <b>203</b> herein is made of a CRT and a printer and outputs the input analysis conditions and the results of the analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each rack <b>226</b> is configured in the form of a tube rack as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and ten sample containers <b>200</b> can be mounted thereon. The sample container <b>200</b> is in the form of a cylinder having a bottom, i.e., in the form of a test tube.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the racks <b>226</b> carrying the sample containers <b>200</b> are arranged in a vertical line in the rack sending section <b>222</b>, all the racks <b>226</b> serially travel in the direction indicated by an arrow C. Then, the rack <b>226</b> at the forefront is sent to the transferring section <b>210</b> on the left hand to be transferred in the transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Above the transferring section <b>210</b>, part of the blood analyzer <b>218</b> is arranged. The rack <b>226</b> transferred by the transferring section <b>210</b> is stopped in a position where the sample container <b>200</b> at the forefront is opposed to the barcode reader <b>217</b>. After the barcode reader <b>217</b> reads the barcode on the sample container <b>200</b>, the sample container <b>200</b> is transferred again in the transverse direction and stopped at a position immediately below the stirrer <b>211</b> of the blood analyzer <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">After the sample is stirred by the sample stirrer <b>211</b>, the rack <b>226</b> travels only a predetermined distance (a pitch distance between the sample containers <b>200</b>).

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The sucked sample is quantified in the quantifying section <b>213</b> and analyzed in the analyzing section <b>214</b>. During the suction process by the suction apparatus <b>212</b>, the stirrer <b>211</b> stirs the sample in the following sample container <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The racks <b>226</b> are intermittently transferred by the pitch distance between the sample containers <b>200</b> and the barcode reader <b>204</b> of the smear preparing apparatus <b>215</b> sequentially reads the barcodes on the sample containers <b>200</b> that have gone through the analysis. The control section <b>201</b> identifies from the barcodes the sample which should be prepared as a smear according to the analysis results, and the corresponding sample is stirred by the stirrer <b>206</b>. Then, the stirred sample is sucked from the sample container <b>200</b> by the suction apparatus <b>205</b> to prepare the smear in the smear preparing section <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">After the ten sample containers (all sample containers carried on a single rack <b>226</b>) are subjected to the suction process for sucking the sample which needs to be prepared as a smear, the rack <b>226</b> is transferred in the direction of an arrow D to be collected in the rack collecting section <b>216</b> in the direction of an arrow E. The racks <b>226</b> are sequentially sent from the rack sending section <b>222</b> to the transferring section <b>210</b> at a predetermined distance and the above-mentioned treatment is performed repetitively with respect to the sample containers <b>200</b> on each rack <b>226</b>.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, supporting parts <b>2</b><i>c </i>to <b>2</b><i>f </i>are provided inside the cassette <b>1</b> to support a slide glass <b>10</b> inserted through the insert hole <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Since an adequate clearance is ensured between both surfaces of the slide glass <b>10</b> and inner surfaces of the cassette <b>1</b>, the stain solution and the air in the cassette <b>1</b> can easily contact the both surfaces of the slide glass <b>10</b>. The cassette <b>1</b> has hooks <b>2</b><i>g </i>and <b>2</b><i>h </i>extending in a horizontal direction from both shoulders, so that the cassette <b>1</b> is hung on transfer belts by the hooks <b>2</b><i>g </i>and <b>2</b><i>h </i>as mentioned later.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, the smear preparing section <b>207</b> includes a conveyer <b>6</b> which conveys the cassette <b>1</b> carrying the slide glass <b>10</b> from the receiving operation section <b>9</b> toward the direction of an arrow H, a conveyer <b>5</b> which receives the cassette <b>1</b> from the conveyer <b>6</b> to send it toward the direction of an arrow J by hanging it on belts <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a conveyer <b>8</b> which receives the cassette <b>1</b> from the conveyer <b>5</b> to transfer it in the direction of an arrow N and a storage conveyer <b>26</b> which receives the cassette <b>1</b> from the conveyer <b>8</b> to transfer it in the direction of an arrow K by hanging it on belts <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>and stores the cassette <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the smearing section <b>20</b>, a plurality of slide glasses <b>10</b> are placed on a turntable <b>12</b> and are taken one by one to be transferred in the direction of an arrow L by a conveyer <b>22</b>. A sample sucked by the suction apparatus <b>205</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is dropped onto the slide glass <b>10</b> by a dispensing mechanism <b>14</b> and smeared by a smearing mechanism <b>16</b>. The slide glass <b>10</b> on which the sample is smeared is mounted on a conveyer <b>18</b> to be transferred in the direction of an arrow M, and then received in the empty cassette <b>1</b> in the receiving operation section <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At the forefront of the conveyer <b>5</b>, a first treatment section <b>7</b> for treating the smeared slide glass <b>10</b> is provided. The first treatment section <b>7</b> injects a May-Grunwald solution (in which 99% is methanol) in the cassette <b>1</b> to immerse the slide glass <b>10</b> therein for a predetermined period. Then, air is blown to the smeared surface of the slide glass <b>10</b> to evaporate the liquid component thereon, thereby drying the smeared surface.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, the first treatment section <b>7</b> injects the May-Grunwald solution again in the cassette <b>1</b> to immerse the slide glass <b>10</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Subsequently, the May-Grunwald solution is drained out of the cassette <b>1</b> in a second treatment section <b>42</b> and a May-Grunwald dilution is injected in the cassette <b>1</b>. The slide glass <b>10</b> in the cassette <b>1</b> is immersed in the May-Grunwald dilution for a predetermined period while the cassette <b>1</b> is conveyed in the direction of the arrow J.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Then, in a third treatment section <b>44</b>, the May-Grunwald dilution is drained out of the cassette <b>1</b> and a Giemsa solution is injected. The slide glass <b>10</b> in the cassette <b>1</b> is immersed in the Giemsa solution for a predetermined period while the cassette <b>1</b> is conveyed in the direction of the arrow J.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Then, in a fourth treatment section <b>46</b>, the Giemsa solution is drained out of the cassette <b>1</b> and washing liquid is dispensed and drained, thereby the slide glass <b>10</b> is washed. Thus, the smeared sample on the slide glass <b>10</b> is double-stained with the May-Grunwald and Giemsa solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Thereafter, air is blown in the cassette <b>1</b> to dry the stained slide glass <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The cassette <b>1</b> carrying the stained slide glass <b>10</b> is sent to the storage conveyer <b>26</b> via the conveyer <b>8</b> and stored therein.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Then, by an operator, the cassette is taken out of the storage conveyor <b>26</b> and the slide glass <b>10</b> is placed under a microscope for blood cell observation.</p>

Thus, the support arm <b>70</b> comes off the cam <b>71</b> and an edge of the spreader glass <b>68</b> presses the slide glass <b>10</b> under the bias force of the spring <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, the stepping motor <b>52</b> is driven to shift the spreader glass <b>68</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>1</b>, thereby the sample <b>10</b><i>a </i>is smeared on the surface of the slide glass <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Subsequently, the stepping motor <b>60</b> is driven to move the spreader glass <b>68</b> upward. The smeared slide glass <b>10</b> is received in the cassette <b>1</b> as mentioned above and subjected to the staining process.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Subsequently, the stepping motor <b>60</b> is driven to move the vertically moving plate <b>66</b> in the direction of the arrow Y<b>2</b>.

Therefore, the end of the support arm <b>70</b> is pulled by the spring <b>77</b>, rotated in a clockwise direction and latched by the stop pin <b>79</b> to be maintained in a vertical state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, the stepping motor <b>60</b> is driven to allow the vertically moving plate <b>66</b> to descend in the direction of the arrow Y<b>2</b>, thereby the edge of the spreader glass <b>68</b> is introduced in a washing bath <b>82</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the spreader glass <b>68</b> is moved downward in the vertical direction to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as mentioned above, the stepping motor <b>60</b> is stopped and the spreader glass <b>68</b> is maintained in the position.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Then, the stepping motor <b>90</b> is driven to move the nozzle heads <b>85</b> and <b>86</b> in the direction of an arrow Z<b>1</b> and the washing liquid (physiologic saline) is discharged from the nozzles <b>85</b><i>a </i>and <b>86</b><i>a </i>toward the spreader glass <b>68</b>. After the nozzle heads <b>85</b> and <b>86</b> have passed over the spreader glass <b>68</b> from end to end, the stepping motor <b>90</b> is stopped to stop the nozzle heads <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>.</p>

The washing liquid discharged from the nozzles <b>85</b><i>a </i>and <b>86</b><i>a </i>is stored in the concave portion <b>82</b><i>a </i>of the washing bath <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Then, the stepping motor <b>60</b> is driven to move the spreader glass <b>68</b> downward in the vertical direction to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> so that the edge of the spreader glass <b>68</b> is sufficiently immersed in the washing liquid in the concave portion <b>82</b><i>a</i>. At the same time, the ultrasonic transducer <b>83</b> is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a driving circuit of the ultrasonic transducer <b>83</b>. A driving section <b>96</b> is equipped with an inverter which outputs an a.c. voltage of 67 kHz to the ultrasonic transducer <b>83</b>. The control section <b>201</b> controls amplitude Vp of the output voltage of the driving section <b>96</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17(</figref><i>a</i>) or <b>17</b>(<i>b</i>), or alternatively, intermits the output periodically as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(</figref><i>c</i>) to control an ON period t<sub>ON </sub>and an OFF period t<sub>OFF</sub>, thereby adjusting the oscillation energy applied by the ultrasonic transducer <b>83</b> to the washing liquid via the washing bath <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The control section <b>201</b> calculates the viscosity of the sample which is smeared on the slide glass <b>10</b> by using the spreader glass <b>68</b> in the above-described smearing process based on at least one of the number of erythrocytes, the number of leukocytes, the amount of hemoglobin and the hematocrit value that have been obtained from the sample (the higher these values are, the higher the viscosity of the sample is). The control section <b>201</b> adjusts the amplitude Vp of the output voltage or the ON-OFF period of the driving section <b>96</b> based on the calculated viscosity. Then, in accordance with the adjusted output voltage, the ultrasonic transducer <b>83</b> is driven for time T (e.g., 10 seconds). That is, the driving section <b>96</b> drives the ultrasonic transducer <b>83</b> to increase the ultrasound responsive to an increase in the calculated viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Thus, the ultrasonic transducer <b>83</b> applies optimum oscillation energy to the washing liquid in the concave portion <b>82</b><i>a </i>to effectively wash away the remaining sample adhered to the spreader glass <b>68</b>. When the time T has passed and the transducer <b>83</b> is stopped, the stepping motor <b>60</b> is driven to pull the spreader glass <b>68</b> out of the washing liquid and move it upward to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. At the same time, the washing liquid is drained away through the drain outlet <b>82</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Subsequently, drying air is discharged from the drying air discharge nozzles <b>85</b><i>b </i>and <b>86</b><i>b</i>. At the same time, the stepping motor <b>90</b> is driven to shift the nozzle heads <b>85</b> and <b>86</b> toward the direction of an arrow Z<b>2</b> to a position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. When the nozzle heads <b>85</b> and <b>86</b> are returned to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the nozzles <b>85</b><i>b </i>and <b>86</b><i>b </i>stop the discharge of the drying air. Thus, the spreader glass <b>68</b> is dried.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Then, the stepping motors <b>52</b> and <b>60</b> are driven to move the horizontally moving plate <b>58</b> and the vertically moving plate <b>66</b>, thereby returning the spreader glass <b>68</b> to an initial position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, the spreader glass <b>68</b> is ready for the next smearing.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrating a modified example of the washing bath and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a fragmentary view taken in the direction of arrows along a line Y-Y of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The modified washing bath is made by adhering two semi-cylinder parts <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> made of a resin to the inner wall of the cylindrical concave portion <b>82</b><i>a </i>of the washing bath <b>82</b>. By providing the semi-cylinder parts <b>100</b> and <b>101</b>, the volume of the concave portion <b>82</b> is reduced, which saves the amount of the washing liquid required for washing.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to the present invention, the ultrasound is applied to the washing section and the spreader glass is effectively washed under ultrasound.</p>
