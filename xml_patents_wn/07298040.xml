<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to packages for integrated circuits. More particularly, the present invention relates to package arrangement to reduce loop inductance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Presently used to make integrated circuits with printed circuit boards, ball grid arrays (BGA's) packages are leadless, surface-mounted packages in which solder balls interconnects cover the bottom surface of the package in a checkerboard fashion. Typically, a mass reflow process is used to attach BGA's to printed circuit boards (PCB's), a term generally used for printed circuit configurations such as rigid or flexible, single, double, or multilayered boards that are completely processed. Integrated circuit (IC) is the term generally used for a microelectronic semiconductor device consisting of many interconnected transistors and other components. Typically, IC's are fabricated on a small rectangle called a die that is cut from a silicon wafer known as a substrate. Different areas of the substrate are “doped” with other elements to make them either “p-type” or “n-type.” Polysilicon or aluminum tracks are etched in one to three (or more) layers deposited over the substrate's surface(s). The die is then connected into a package using gold wires, which are welded to “pads,” usually found near the edge of the die.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ball grid arrays formed on multilayer substrates typically incorporate within the BGA substrate pattern drilled holes in laminate called vias, which connect different layers of circuitry. Typically, at least one via is positioned between two diagonal balls on the substrate, or on the printed circuit board (PCB).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inductance is the ability of a conductor to produce an induced voltage when cut by a magnetic flux; A conductor is a material capable of conveying an electric current. Virtually all conductors have inductance, but the amount of inductance associated with each conductor varies according to a number of factors such as type of conductive material, shape of the conductor, length of the conductor, and so forth. For example, a shorter wire has less inductance than a long wire because less conductor length cut by a magnetic flux produces less voltage. Similarly, a straight wire has less inductance than a coiled wire because the conductor concentrates more conductor length in a given area of magnetic flux.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Induction (the production of an induced current within a conductor) occurs whenever magnetic flux cuts across a conductor, such as when a wire is moved within a stationary magnetic field, or when a magnetic field fluctuates about a fixed wire. One characteristic of inductors is that the faster the speed at which the flux changes, the more voltage is induced. The flux induces change in current. For example, Alternating current (AC) circuits continually produce an induced voltage because the current is continuously changing. The faster the current changes, the higher the induced voltage, which always opposes the change in voltage. If current increased, the polarity of the induced voltage opposes the increase in current, and vice versa. However, it is not necessary for the current to alternate directions. Inductance affects DC circuits transient responses whenever the value of the DC current changes, such as when a DC circuit is turned on and off. The switch induces a transient which is a change. The transient will settle to a new value according to the response of the network. Digital signaling is a sequence of transients. Further details concerning about inductance and simultaneous switching noise can be found in the book entitled <i>Digital Signal Integrity: Modeling and Simulation with Interconnects and Packages</i>, by Brian Young, published by Prentice Hall PTR.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mutual inductance typically occurs whenever two conductors are positioned closely together such that a varying fluxes resulting from a change in current in Conductor A cuts across and induces voltage in Conductor B. This induced voltage, in turn, generates a magnetic flux that cuts across and induces a voltage in conductor A. Because a current in one conductor can induce voltage in the adjacent conductor, the conductors are said to have mutual inductance. To offset this appreciable effect, traces, leads, and current return path are usually kept as short as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of these inductance discussed above seriously affects, and in some cases limits, the input/output (I/O) processing speeds of integrated circuits. For example, in the case where all the bus outputs of a circuit simultaneously switch the same way, there will be a current surge flowing in the circuit. This current surge generates an appreciable induced voltage in the circuit's conductors. The induced voltage generates a current flowing opposite to the wave of current, reduces the amount of current flowing through the circuit, thereby slowing the settling time current flow. It is clear that faster processing times will result if system inductance can be minimized. Thus it apparent to one with ordinary skill in the art that a better design is needed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a typical electronic package in the art. The package <b>100</b> includes an integrated circuit (IC) chip, also called die <b>101</b>. The die <b>101</b> is attached on a ball grid array (BGA) substrate <b>102</b>, which is mounted on a circuit board, such as printed circuit board (PCB) <b>103</b>. Die <b>101</b> normally contains a plurality of electrically conductive contacts, called die pads <b>104</b> on the top surface of the die <b>101</b>. BGA substrate <b>102</b> includes a plurality of electrically conductive contacts, also known as bond pads <b>105</b>. Bond pads <b>105</b> receive the bond wires <b>108</b> attached to the die pads <b>104</b>. Electrically conductive traces <b>107</b> and <b>109</b> connect bond pads <b>105</b> to components in other areas or other layers, such as by-pass capacitors <b>116</b> mounted on the PCB <b>103</b>. The BGA substrate is mounted on the PCB through a grid array of solder balls, such as solder balls <b>113</b> and <b>111</b>. The components on different layers are connected through a grid of vias, such as vias <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>115</b>. In this conventional package, a return path has to be picked up through either through vias <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>, and solder balls <b>111</b>, or the return path has to be formed through vias <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, and solder balls <b>113</b>. Typical distance between the core balls <b>113</b> and the bond pads <b>105</b> may be approximately 2000 micron, and typical distance between the perimeter balls <b>111</b> and the bond pads <b>105</b> may be approximately 3000 micron. As a result, the return path is formed through a relatively large loop. These long loops have significant loop inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an electrical model of a loop inductance. When a signal switches from zero volts to Ve, because of the long loop <b>200</b>, the looping inductance causes Ve to be switched <b>202</b> significantly slower than expected <b>201</b>. As a result, the looping inductance reduces the switching speed of an IC device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a typical signal paths in a conventional bonding method. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, signal paths <b>303</b> are wired from die pads <b>302</b> of a die <b>301</b> and the bond wires <b>303</b> are attached to bond pads <b>304</b> of a BGA substrate, forming signals S<sub>1 </sub>to S<sub>9</sub>, etc. If these signals are transmitted on the same direction, when they switch, the mutual inductance in the package is significant. Typically voltage resulting from the mutual inductance may be illustrated as follows:</p>

Wherein L is the self inductance of signal S<sub>1</sub>, and M<sub>1x </sub>is the mutual inductance between the signal S<sub>1 </sub>and signal S<sub>x</sub>. As a result, the voltage resulting from the mutual inductance could be significant, because all mutual inductances are additive and have the same sign as the self inductance. This raises the effective inductance for a given signal, for example, in some cases, by as much as five to ten times.
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another typical electronic package in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a bottom view <b>401</b> of BGA substrate <b>406</b>. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, conventional solder balls are placed either directly under and within the die <b>405</b> area, called core balls <b>403</b>, or placed outside of the bond attachment area (e.g., bond wire wedge area), such was area <b>404</b>, called perimeter balls <b>402</b> or the outer balls. The area where the outer balls <b>402</b> are placed is called outer ball region. The area <b>404</b> between the core balls <b>403</b> and the perimeter balls <b>402</b> normally is a ball free zone. The area <b>404</b> is normally used to attach the bond wires from the die <b>405</b> mounted on the device attachment area <b>421</b>. Connections between the die <b>405</b> and the BGA substrate <b>406</b> are formed through bond wires <b>408</b> attached on the bond pads <b>412</b> located in the bond attachment area <b>404</b>. The return paths have to be formed either using core balls <b>403</b> through vias <b>413</b>, or using perimeter balls <b>402</b> through vias <b>411</b>, to connect with other components on the other side of the PCB <b>407</b>, such as by pass capacitors <b>419</b> and <b>420</b>. As a result, a large loop inductance has been created.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, the structure includes a plurality of electrically conductive contacts disposed on a surface of the IC device, plurality of electrically conductive contacts being disposed in at least two rows, a plurality of first return paths formed through some of the plurality of electrically conductive contacts, a plurality of signal paths formed through some of the plurality of electrically conductive contacts, and wherein at least one of the plurality of first return paths are placed between every predetermined number of the plurality of the signal paths.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the bond wires connect between the die pads <b>503</b> of the die <b>501</b> and the bond pads <b>506</b> of the BGA substrate <b>502</b>. The bond wires are configured such that signal paths are mixed with return paths. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, signal paths <b>505</b> are mixed with return paths <b>504</b> and <b>509</b>. Return paths <b>504</b> and <b>509</b> may be the same type of return path. Alternatively, return paths <b>504</b> and <b>509</b> may be different types of return paths. For example, return path <b>504</b> may be a Vdd path and return path <b>509</b> may be Vss path. Preferably a signal path is placed adjacent to a return path. In one embodiment, every certain signal paths are placed between two return paths. In a preferred embodiment, every three signal paths, such as S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>3</b>, are placed between return paths R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>. Since the directions of the signal and return paths are opposite, the voltage induced by the mutual inductance terms, that couple the return paths current, have a sign that cancels with the self inductance term reducing the overall inductive voltage drop. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads <b>503</b> and bond pads <b>506</b>, are disposed in at least two rows. It would appreciated that multiple rows may be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, according to one embodiment, the signal paths and return paths may be arranged in multiple heights, such that the mutual inductance may be cancelled in both horizontal and vertical direction (e.g., in a three dimensional (3D) pattern). For example, signal path <b>507</b>, which runs on the top surface of the BGA substrate <b>502</b>, may cancel the mutual inductance generated by the return path <b>508</b>, which is laid inside the BGA substrate <b>502</b>. Further, the signal path <b>507</b> may further cancel other mutual inductance induced from other return paths on the top surface of the BGA substrate <b>502</b>, as well as those embedded inside the BGA substrate <b>502</b>, similar to the return path <b>508</b>. As a result, the mutual inductance is cancelled in a 3D pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although there is one layer shown inside the BGA substrate <b>502</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it would be appreciated that multiple layers of signal and return paths may be laid inside the BGA substrate <b>502</b>, as well as inside the PCB (not shown) on which the BGA substrate <b>502</b> is disposed. Such multiple layers of mixed signal and return paths constitute a 3D mixed signal and return paths structure. Such 3D mixed signal and return paths structure further improves the cancellation of the mutual inductance. In a further embodiment, a power plane and a ground plane may be embedded inside the BGA substrate <b>502</b> and the corresponding PCB (not shown) to mix with the signal and return paths.</p>

Wherein the L is self inductance of the signal S<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>1x </sub>is mutual inductance between signal S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>x</sub>. M<sub>1R </sub>is the mutual inductance between S<sub>1 </sub>and the corresponding return path. The voltage induced by the return path will substantially cancel the additive terms due to other signal lines. Thus the effective inductance resulting from the loop has been significantly reduced.
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The loop inductance may be further reduced by an arrangement of bond pads illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the bond pads are arranged in multiple rows, wherein the signal paths are mixed with return paths. In one embodiment, the bond wires are arranged in multiple heights (e.g., multiple levels in vertical direction, some bond wires are formed above the others) to form a 3D structure. For example, bond wires <b>606</b> are formed above the bond wires <b>607</b>. Both bond wires <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> may include both signal paths and return paths. As a result, the loop inductance may be cancelled in a three dimensional pattern. Furthermore, as discussed above, similar 3D structure may be embedded inside the BGA substrate <b>602</b> and the PCB <b>603</b>, to form another 3D mixed signal and return path structure inside the BGA substrate <b>602</b> and the PCB <b>603</b>. As a result, mutual inductance of the conductors inside the BGA substrate <b>602</b> and the PCB <b>603</b> may be cancelled in a 3D pattern. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads <b>608</b> and bond pads <b>604</b> and <b>605</b>, are disposed in at least two rows. It would appreciated that multiple rows may be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention. As the density of a package is getting high, the die pads on a die may include multiple rows of die pads. In one embodiment, outer row includes signal and return paths (e.g., power and ground signals), and the inner rows include signal paths. The signal paths are mixed with return paths in a pattern similar to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads disposed on the die and bond pads disposed on the BGA substrate, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires connecting the die pads and the bond pads may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an electrical model of a conventional IC wire bonding structure. When a signal switches from a low state (e.g., zero volts) to a high state (e.g., 2.1 volts), in the case of <b>801</b>, Vdd <b>804</b> is utilized as return path. On the other hand, when a signal switches from a high state to a low state, Vss <b>806</b> is used as return path. As a result, only one return path (e.g., either Vdd or Vss) is used. Loop inductance may be further reduced when both Vdd and Vss return paths are used. As described earlier, loop inductance occurs when a signal switches in a signal path.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, an alternating current (AC) capacitance device <b>907</b> is coupled to both Vdd return path <b>903</b> and Vss return path <b>905</b>, on a driver <b>906</b> driving the signal <b>904</b>. When the signal <b>904</b> switches from one state to another, the AC capacitance device <b>907</b> causes an instance shortage across the Vdd and Vss return paths. As a result, both Vdd and Vss can be used as return paths by the signal <b>904</b>. Thus, self inductance L<sub>1 </sub>of signal <b>904</b> may be reduced by the mutual inductance M<sub>12 </sub>and M<sub>13 </sub>from the return paths Vdd and Vss. Overall effective inductance may be reduced consequently. The voltage induced from the loop inductance may be illustrated as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates yet another exemplary aspect of the present invention. The electronic package includes a multi-layer substrate having a top surface and a bottom surface, a device attachment area disposed centrally on the top surface, a plurality of bond attachment areas disposed peripherally around the device attachment area on the top surface, the bond attachment areas including a plurality of the electrically conductive contacts receiving bond wires from an integrated circuit (IC) device attached to the device attachment area, a grid of electrically conductive balls disposed on the bottom surface, between the perimeter of the device attachment area (e.g., area <b>1020</b>) and the bond attachment areas (e.g., area <b>1004</b>), a first grid of electrically conductive vias disposed between the perimeter of the device attachment area and the bond attachment areas, the first grid of electrically conductive vias connecting the top and bottom surfaces through the substrate, and a plurality of electrically conductive traces for forming electrical interconnections between the balls, the vias, and the electrically conductive contacts of the bond attachment areas.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in this embodiment, a bottom view <b>1001</b> of BGA substrate <b>1007</b> is shown. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, additional balls <b>1004</b> are placed between the core balls <b>1003</b> and the perimeter balls <b>1002</b>, also as known as free ball zone <b>404</b>, or the bond attachment area of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a conventional design. Specifically, additional balls <b>1004</b> are placed between the perimeter of the device attachment area (e.g., the area <b>1020</b> where the die <b>1006</b> is disposed), and the outer balls region <b>1021</b>(e.g., the area where balls <b>1002</b> are placed). The additional balls <b>1004</b> are placed near the bond pads <b>1016</b> receiving the bond wires <b>1009</b> from the die <b>1006</b>. The balls <b>1004</b> enable the bond wire connection reaches other components, such as by pass capacitor <b>1012</b> on the other side of the PCB <b>1008</b>. As a result, the connection has much shorter loop and the loop inductance has been greatly reduced. Current flow is illustrated by arrowed lines that form a closed loop. Without the additional balls <b>1004</b>, a conventional connection must go through the perimeter balls <b>1002</b> and their associated bias <b>1014</b> and <b>1015</b> to connect to other components such as capacitor <b>1013</b>, which contains much longer loop and loop inductance. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads disposed on the die and bond pads disposed on the BGA substrate, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires connecting the die pads and the bond pads may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a bottom view of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The package <b>1100</b> includes conventional perimeter balls <b>1101</b> and core balls <b>1102</b> within the die edges. In addition, the package <b>1100</b> includes additional balls <b>1103</b> and vias <b>1104</b> between the perimeter balls <b>1101</b> and the core balls <b>1102</b>, so called free ball zone. These balls <b>1103</b> and vias <b>1104</b> enable the bond wires to connect to other components such as by pass capacitor <b>1012</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in a much shorter loop. As a result, the loop inductance can be maintained at a lower level.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an electrical model of inductance distribution according to one embodiment of the invention, where Lvb indicates a ball inductance, Lcv illustrates via inductance in the PCB board. The inductance L in the shaded region, such as region <b>1201</b> indicates the capacitors intrinsic inductance, and where Lvp illustrates via inductance in the package substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the signal paths and return paths are construed that there is a return path between every certain number of signal paths. In one embodiment, a return path is placed between every three signal paths. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, signal paths <b>1302</b> are placed between return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b>. Return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b> may be the same type of return paths. Alternatively, return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b> may be different type of return paths. In one embodiment, return path <b>1301</b> may be a Vdd path and return path <b>1303</b> may be a Vss path. In case of both return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b> are the same type of return path, the signal paths <b>1302</b> (e.g., including S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>3</b>) may utilize both return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b> as return paths. As a result, the signal paths and return paths are formed in very tight loop. Since the directions of the return paths and signal paths are opposite, the loop inductance will be reduced by the mutual inductance between signal and return paths. Thus the loop inductance may be maintained at an acceptable level.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When both return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b> are different (e.g., Vdd and Vss return paths), an AC capacitance device <b>1306</b> is coupled to both return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b>. Because of the AC characteristics of the AC capacitance device <b>1306</b>, when a signal in the signal paths <b>1302</b> switches from one state to another, the AC capacitance device <b>1306</b> instantaneously provides shortage over both return paths. As a result, both return paths may be used by the signal paths <b>1302</b>. For the same reasons above, the loop inductance may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, in one embodiment, signals, such as signals <b>1310</b> may run on a surface of the BGA substrate and the return paths may run underneath the surface. The return paths may be construed as multiple layers planes inside the substrate. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the signal paths <b>1310</b> and return paths <b>1311</b> are laid out very closely to minimize the loop (e.g., loop inductance). In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads disposed on the die and bond pads disposed on the BGA substrate, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires connecting the die pads and the bond pads may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows yet another alternative embodiment. In this embodiment, the bond pads are laid out in multiple rows. Each row includes a pattern that a return path is placed between every certain number of signal paths. In one embodiment, a return path is placed between every three signal paths. For example, signal paths <b>1302</b> are placed between return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b> on one row, and signal paths <b>1308</b> are placed between return paths <b>1307</b> and <b>1309</b> on the other row. It would be appreciated that multiple rows are placed in a mixed patter such that no more than one return path is placed adjacent to each other. In one embodiment, the return paths may be the same type of return path. Alternatively, the return paths may include Vdd and Vss return paths. In case of Vdd and Vss return paths, it is preferred to have signal paths are placed between a Vdd return path and a Vss return path. Thus, every certain number of signal paths (e.g., every three signal paths), there is a Vdd return path or a Vss return path in between. It would be appreciated that Vdd and Vss paths are placed alternately between the signal paths.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, an AC capacitance device <b>1306</b> is placed on each driver driving a signal through a signal path. The AC capacitance device <b>1306</b> is coupled to both Vdd and Vss return paths. When a signal such as signal <b>1302</b> switches from one state to another, as described above, the AC capacitance device <b>1306</b> enables a driver, such as driver <b>1305</b>, to receive returning signal from both return paths <b>1301</b> and <b>1303</b>. In one embodiment, the AC capacitance device includes a capacitor. The AC capacitance device may have a value of 100 pF. As a result, the loop inductance may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Furthermore, the bond wires connecting from die pads <b>1313</b> of a die to bond pads <b>1314</b> of a BGA substrate may be construed such that some bond wires are wired above other bond wires. For example, bond wires <b>1304</b> are construed above the other bond wires, such as bond wires <b>1312</b>. As a result, the signal paths are mixed with return paths in a three dimensional pattern. Therefore the loop inductance may be further reduced. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads <b>1313</b> and bond pads <b>1314</b>, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires <b>1304</b> and <b>1312</b>, which connect the die pads <b>1313</b> and the bond pads <b>1314</b>, may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates another alternative embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, multiple rows of die pads <b>1413</b> and multiple rows of bond pads <b>1411</b> and <b>1412</b> are used for high density bond wiring on a semiconductor chip. In one embodiment, the signal paths are mixed with return paths, for example, a return path is placed between every certain number of signal paths, as described above. In an alternative embodiment, a row of bond pads, such as row <b>1411</b> may be used for hybrid signals. Hybrid signals may include signals, power and ground. The other rows such as row <b>1412</b> may be used for data signals. In a further alternative embodiment, row <b>1411</b> may be used for return paths, including Vdd and Vss return paths.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, signal paths may be wired over the return paths. For example, signal paths <b>1404</b> may be wired above the return paths <b>1405</b>. As a result, the mixed pattern of signal and return paths are construed in a three dimensional pattern. In an alternative embodiment, return paths may be wired over the signal paths, such that the return paths may be used to shield the signal paths from extra interference from noise. It would be appreciated that multiple heights of bond wires may be construed wherein signal and return paths are mixed in vertical orientation, as well as in horizontal orientation. As a result, a 3D structure having multiple levels of mixed signal and return paths is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, additional balls <b>1407</b> and vias <b>1409</b> are placed in the conventional free balls zone, between the core balls, such as balls <b>1414</b>, and the perimeter balls, such as balls <b>1406</b>. It is preferred to have balls <b>1407</b> and vias <b>1409</b> placed near the bond pads <b>1411</b> and <b>1412</b>. In one embodiment the vias <b>1409</b> are placed right next to the bond pads. The balls <b>1407</b> and vias <b>1409</b> enable the connection from the bond pads to access to other components on the other side of the PCB such as by pass capacitor <b>1410</b>. As a result, the connection contains a much shorter loop and the loop inductance may be reduced. A conventional method requires the connection either goes through the core balls <b>1414</b> or the perimeter balls <b>1406</b>, which has a longer loop and higher loop inductance. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads <b>1413</b> and bond pads <b>1411</b> and <b>1412</b>, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires <b>1404</b> and <b>1405</b> may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> shows another alternative embodiment of the invention. The package in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> includes a mixed pattern of signal paths and return paths, similar to one in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In addition, extra balls <b>1504</b> and vias <b>1505</b> are placed in the conventional free balls zone to provide shorter loop to access to other components, such as capacitor <b>1506</b>, on the other side of the PCB. Furthermore, the bond wires may be construed mixing signal and return paths in a three dimensional pattern, which may further reduce the loop inductance. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads disposed on the die and bond pads disposed on the BGA substrate, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires connecting the die pads and the bond pads may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows yet another alternative embodiment of the invention. The package illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> includes a mixed pattern of signal paths and return paths in a three dimensional (3D) structure. For example, a signal path <b>1512</b> runs from a die pad area <b>1513</b> of the die <b>1501</b> to the bond attachment area <b>1514</b> of the BGA substrate <b>1502</b>. A return path <b>1511</b> goes in an opposite direction from bond attachment area <b>1514</b> to the die pad area <b>1513</b> of the die <b>1501</b>. The signal path <b>1512</b> and the return path <b>1511</b> are arranged in adjacent to each other in a horizontal orientation. As a result, the loop inductance generated from the loop of signal path <b>1512</b> and the return path <b>1511</b> will be reduced by the mutual inductance between the signal path <b>1512</b> and the return path <b>1511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, the loop inductance may be further reduced by the mutual inductance between the signal path <b>1512</b> and another return path <b>1510</b> in a vertical orientation. The 3D structure will greatly reduce the over all loop inductance of the circuits. It would be appreciated that these 3D structures are construed through out the electronic package. It would be further appreciated that these 3D structures are also applied to the multiple layers of signal path and return path, as well as power and ground planes embedded inside the BGA substrate <b>1502</b> and PCB <b>1503</b> (not shown), to further reduce the loop inductance of the circuitries in those area.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, a grid of electrically conductive balls, such as balls <b>1504</b>, is placed between the perimeter of the device attachment area (e.g., the perimeter of the die <b>1501</b>), and the bond attachment area (e.g., bond pad area <b>1514</b>) of the BGA substrate <b>1502</b>. Alternatively, the electrically conductive balls, such as ball <b>1515</b>, may be placed between the bond attachment area and the conventional I/O ball (e.g., ball <b>1508</b>) area. These balls <b>1504</b> a-re used to connect to a capacitor disposed on the bottom surface of the PCB <b>1503</b> through a grid of vias <b>1505</b>. The capacitor <b>1506</b> may be a surface mount capacitor. The ball <b>1504</b>, capacitor <b>1506</b>, as well as vias <b>1505</b> constitute short loop which induce a minimum loop inductance when the signal switches. Similarly, the capacitor <b>1507</b>, ball <b>1508</b>, and vias <b>1509</b> also have the same effect to reduce the loop inductance. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads in the die pad area <b>1513</b> and bond pads in bond pad area <b>1514</b>, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows yet another alternative embodiment of the invention. In addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an AC capacitance device <b>1601</b> is placed on a driver <b>1602</b> driving a signal through a signal path. When the signal switches from one state to another, the AC capacitance device <b>1601</b> enables the driver <b>1602</b> to receive a returning signal from both return paths <b>1603</b> and <b>1604</b>. In one embodiment, the AC capacitance device includes a capacitor. The AC capacitance device may have a value of 100 pF. As a result, the loop inductance may be further reduced. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads disposed on the die and bond pads disposed on the BGA substrate, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires connecting the die pads and the bond pads may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows yet another alternative embodiment of the invention. In addition to the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an AC capacitance device <b>1701</b> is placed on a driver <b>1702</b> driving a signal through a signal path. When the signal switches from one state to another, the AC capacitance device <b>1701</b> enables the driver <b>1702</b> to receive a returning signal from both return paths <b>1703</b> and <b>1704</b>. As a result, the loop inductance may be further reduced. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads disposed on the die and bond pads disposed on the BGA substrate, are disposed in at least two rows. Alternatively, multiple rows may be disposed. In addition, in one embodiment, the bond wires connecting the die pads and the bond pads may be construed in multiple heights.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> shows a top signal layer of a preferred embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows a bottom signal layer of a preferred embodiment of the invention. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, extra vias <b>1812</b> are placed between the die <b>1810</b> and the bond attachment area (e.g., bonding wedges) <b>1811</b>, which is considered as free balls zone in a conventional design. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18C and 18D</figref> show a ground layer <b>1803</b> and a power layer <b>1804</b> respectively. Ground layer <b>1803</b> and power layer <b>1804</b> are construed as ground plane and power plane. Thus, signal paths are placed on either top signal layer <b>1801</b> or the bottom signal layer <b>1802</b>. The return paths are placed on the ground plane <b>1803</b> and the power plane <b>1804</b>. In one embodiment, Vdd return paths are carried on plane <b>1804</b> and Vss return paths are carried on plane <b>1803</b>. The return paths are connected to a die through vias connecting the top layer and the return paths planes. In one embodiment, the return paths may be connected to the die through vias <b>1812</b> disposed between the die <b>1810</b> and the bond wedges <b>1811</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> shows a bottom view of a preferred embodiment. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>, extra balls <b>1809</b> are placed between the conventional perimeter balls <b>1807</b> and the core balls <b>1808</b> to reduce the loop inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> shows an enlarged version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> shows an enlarged version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, addition to conventional core balls <b>1904</b> and perimeter balls <b>1903</b>, extra balls <b>1905</b> and <b>1906</b> are placed between the die <b>1810</b> and the bond wedges <b>1811</b>. Vias <b>1901</b> and <b>1902</b> connect the bond pads <b>1907</b> of the top signal layer <b>1801</b> to the balls <b>1905</b> and <b>1906</b> of the bottom signal layer <b>1802</b>. The bond pads <b>1907</b> may be connected to other components on the other side of a PCB (not shown), through balls <b>1905</b> and <b>1906</b>, and vias <b>1901</b> and <b>1902</b>. As a result, shorter loop is used and the loop inductance may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, balls in the region between die <b>1810</b> and bond wedges <b>1811</b> may have different density, such as a depopulated area to allow more vias to be placed. The general rule is to place opposite polarity vias as close together as possible to have a tight loop, which reduces the loop inductance. Further detailed information concerning depopulation of a BGA substrate to allow via placement can be found in the U.S. co-pending application Ser. No. 09/678,542, filed Oct. 2, 2000 and entitled <i>Depopulation of a Ball Grid Array to Allow Via Placement, </i>by William P. Cornelius, et al., which application is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.
