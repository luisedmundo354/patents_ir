<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a supersonic combustion apparatus and method of using the same for hypersonic materials and propulsion testing, and more specifically, a supersonic heater including a plurality of multiple injection means for varying exit plane Mach numbers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Missiles that can fly at hypersonic speeds for many minutes have a future Naval need to increase standoff distances and reduce the time to impact on time critical targets. To be feasible these missiles must use air breathing propulsion systems that depend upon both subsonic and supersonic combustion to produce thrust for part of their flight. It is further envisioned that future missile systems will be required to fly at speeds that cover a wide range of Mach numbers. For example a single vehicle's speed might vary from Mach 3-5, Mach 4-7, or Mach 4-8 during a single flight. Mach is the ratio of a vehicle's speed to the speed of sound in the fluid at the local conditions of pressure and temperature. The speed of sound in air, in the atmosphere at sea level, is generally about 1,225 kilometers per hour (1117 ft/sec). A vehicle flying at this speed is said to be flying at Mach 1. Twice this speed is Mach 2 and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Supersonic flight is deemed to be anything between Mach 1 and about Mach 4, or four times the speed of sound. Hypersonic speeds lie above that. The fastest currently existing manned air-breathing jet, known as the SR-71 Blackbird, flies at about Mach 3.6. Hyper-X also known as the X-43 recently flew at almost 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10. Speeds over Mach 5 are commonly termed hypersonic. (The Aviation History On-line Museum &amp; GE Aircraft Engines). To achieve such a wide range of flight Mach numbers future vehicles will be required to use both subsonic and supersonic combustion to produce thrust. Turbine based engines can be used to fly from 0 up to approximately Mach 4. A ramjet that has been boosted to around Mach 2.3 can be used to fly up to approximately Mach 5. To attain speeds above Mach 5 future vehicle will probably have to rely on scramjet propulsion. A ramjet engine construct operates by subsonic combustion of fuel in a stream of air compressed by the forward speed of the aircraft itself, as opposed to a normal jet engine, in which the compressor section (the fan blades) compresses the air. Ramjets operate from about Mach 2.3 to Mach 5.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/337,667 filed on Dec. 24, 2002, illustrates the following on scramjet engines. Scramjet is an acronym for Supersonic Combustion Ramjet. The scramjet differs from the ramjet in that combustion takes place at supersonic air velocities through the engine. It is mechanically simple having a burner (2) but vastly more complex aerodynamically than a jet engine. Hydrogen is the ideal fuel used, however other fuels such as hydrocarbons can be used. A ramjet has no moving parts and achieves compression of intake air by the forward speed of the air vehicle. Air entering the intake of a supersonic aircraft is slowed to subsonic velocities and compressed by aerodynamic diffusion created by the inlet and diffuser (1) to velocities and pressures comparable to those in a turbojet augmentor. After fuel injection and combustion the hot gases are accelerated through a nozzle to generate push (thrust).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A scramjet engine construct (supersonic-combustion ramjet) is a ramjet engine in which combustion of fuel in the engine takes place at supersonic velocities. The scramjet has an inlet (1), burner (2), and nozzle (3). Scramjet technology is challenging because only limited testing can be performed in ground facilities. A scramjet works by taking in air at speeds greater than Mach 5, slowing the air velocity to lower supersonic speeds and using it to combust a fuel, accelerating the products of combustion in a supersonic nozzle which in turn creates thrust. Hypersonic missiles will have to utilize both ramjet and scramjet technologies and constructs during a single flight to reach both high speeds and long-range capabilities. In addition transition between the different modes of combustion will be required. Ground test facilities will be required that can simulate variable Mach number air flows to test these future vehicles. Ground test facilities typically depend upon combustion heated air accelerated through a high-speed free jet nozzle to simulate flight like conditions. The ability to vary the free jet Mach number by 1 or 2 Mach numbers during a single test does not currently exist for these high temperature (&gt;1200K) flows. The ability to vary the Mach number during a test is the application for the device described herein. Due to a wide range of flight conditions encountered by these engines during operation, the air mass flow varies considerably while the missile is changing speed and altitude. Changing Mach number and angle of attack necessitate changes in fuel burn rate to maintain the variable fuel consumption within acceptable limits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Combustion instability has been a problem of major concern. Unstable, periodic fluctuation of combustion chamber pressure that has been encountered in ramburners arises from several causes associated with combustion mechanism, aerodynamic conditions, real or apparent shifts in fuel-to-air ratio or heat release, and acoustic resonance. The periodic shedding of vortices produced in highly sheared gas flows has been recognized as a source of substantial acoustic energy for many years. For example, experimental studies have demonstrated that vortex shedding from gas flow restrictors disposed in large, segmented, solid propellant rocket motors couples with the combustion chamber acoustics to generate substantial acoustic pressures. The maximum acoustic energies are produced when the vortex shedding frequency matches one of the acoustic resonances of the combustor. It has been demonstrated that locating the restrictors near a velocity antinode generated the maximum acoustic pressures in a solid propellant rocket motor, with a highly sheared flow occurring at the grain transition boundary in boost/sustain type tactical solid propellant rocket motors.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An apparatus and method for controlling pressure oscillations caused by vortex shedding is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,695 issued to Brown, et al. on Aug. 2, 1988. The '695 patent discloses an apparatus and method for controlling pressure oscillations caused by vortex shedding. Vortex shedding can lead to excessive thrust oscillations and motor vibrations, having a detrimental effect on performance. This is achieved by restricting the grain transition boundary or combustor inlet at the sudden expansion geometry, such that the gas flow separates upstream and produces a vena contracta downstream of the restriction, which combine to preclude the formation of acoustic pressure instabilities in the flowing gas stream. Such an inlet restriction also inhibits the feedback of acoustic pressure to the point of upstream gas flow separation, thereby preventing the formation of organized oscillations. The '695 patent does not present a method or apparatus, which attempts to permit a significant portion of the required enthalpy proportioned to the expansion side of the nozzle via supersonic combustion without the use of expensive film cooled nozzles. Furthermore, the '695 patent does not utilize an oxygen injection means for maintaining flame stability.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Creating long-duration hypersonic flight simulation conditions in a ground test facility can lead to material problems in the facility hardware. The conventional approach to creating these high Mach, high enthalpy flows for testing engine propulsion systems is to expand very high temperature combustion products through a converging-diverging nozzle to the desired pressure, temperature, and Mach number. However, the high total temperature and total pressure required for testing may exceed the material capabilities especially at the throat of the nozzle in the ground test facility. As a result, the conventional high temperature subsonic combustion and nozzle expansion approach requires the use of complex and expensive film cooled nozzles (estimated to cost between $1-2 million) for 100 lbm/sec flow rates to survive the high enthalpy flow conditions for the relatively long test times required by the use of such a device. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/337,667 filed on Dec. 24, 2002, illustrates the following and is hereby incorporated by reference. This device used supersonic combustion to generate the high Mach number flows required for testing while overcoming the problems associated with survival of the facility nozzle throat.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, using the device described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/337,667, the present invention fulfills the need to develop a supersonic combustion heater that can vary the Mach numbers at the exit plane to enable mode transition in future air breathing propulsion systems to be tested. The device described herein accomplishes this variable Mach number by heat addition through a plurality of strategically positioned fuel injections means, enhances kinetics, produces an increased high enthalpy flow source, enhances flame stability, improves mixing between fuel and air, and shortens chemical ignition delay, without the use of expensive film cooled nozzles.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the supersonic combustion air heater apparatus <b>10</b> further comprises an air heater <b>12</b> upstream of the nozzle <b>14</b> to provide heated pressure flow. In this embodiment, the starting pressure flow is heated ranging from total temperature of about 30° C. to about 1650° C. having starting pressures ranging from about 30 psia to about 20,000 psia. In other embodiments, the starting pressure flow is heated ranging from total temperature of about 100° C. to about 1100° C. having starting total pressures ranging from about 200 psia to about 3,000 psia. Either an upstream vitiator or an air heater <b>12</b> provides heated high-pressure flow that is expanded through the nozzle <b>14</b> which accelerates flow to supersonic velocities.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The supersonic combustion apparatus <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, further comprises at least one acoustic cavity <b>26</b> located adjacent and downstream of the throat and having a downstream lip <b>28</b> to cause shedding of periodic coherent vortices downstream. Cavity <b>26</b> enhanced active/passive mixing technology along with the ground based luxury of oxygen injection and added combustor length and weight of the present supersonic combustion heater <b>10</b> is ideal for hypersonic material and engine testing. The construction of the present invention <b>10</b> is based on a side wall cavity <b>26</b> in the supersonic flow duct that is constructed for a desired acoustic resonance.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A boundary layer flow in the supersonic flow duct flaps over this cavity <b>26</b> and periodically impinges on its downstream lip <b>28</b>, which causes shedding of periodic coherent vortices downstream. In this embodiment, the injection of a desired combustible fuel is just downstream of this vortex shedding point and the fuel is entrained into the supersonic vortex and rapidly mixes with the flow. This rapid mixing and the flame holding characteristics of the cavity <b>26</b> are critical to maintaining supersonic combustion. Furthermore, present invention <b>10</b> is related to utilizing flow vortices for controlling heat transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">This embodiment of the present invention <b>10</b> makes use of resonant acoustic cavity driven coherent vorticity to enhance mixing in the supersonic combustion zone and enable heat addition in the diverging area <b>50</b> in the pressure flow.

Other embodiments of the present invention <b>10</b> include a make-up oxygen injection means localized to enhance flame stability.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The materials that are used to construct the converging and diverging sections of the nozzle and throat of this device must be chosen to handle the expected heat flux and pressures. Materials include, but are not limited to Incoloy 909, Haynes 230, Inconel 718, Monel 400, Nickel 201, Titanium-Zirconium-Molybdenum (TZM) 17-4ph steel, Copper-Beryllium, Copper-Zirconium and others. Components made from these materials may require a ceramic coating to further guarantee survival. It is expected that backside cooling using air, water or other liquids and gases will be required.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It may also be necessary to introduce a film cooling gas along the hot gas surface of the nozzle to reduce material temperatures or temperature gradients. Additional flame stabilizer units are located throughout the diverging area <b>50</b> downstream of the first flame stabilizer unit within the diverging area <b>50</b> to produce variable Mach numbers ranging from about 1.5 to about 8. The combustible fuel comprises at least one of hydrogen and hydrocarbons or the like, or any combination thereof. In other embodiments the combustible fuel is hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Combustion gases flowing through a rocket nozzle are subjected to the combined effects of area change and heat addition. The properties of the gas are affected by these two conditions. Equations below describe the state of the flow of a frictionless one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas. Differential forms of the one-dimensional ideal gas continuity, momentum, and equation of state along with the definition of Mach number when density and velocity are eliminated leads to the single differential equation shown in Equation 1. Employing the standard isentropic flow relation between stagnation (total) temperature (T<sub>0</sub>), static temperature (T), and Mach number (M). Equation 1 is re-expressed in terms of T<sub>0 </sub>as Equation 2. A useful simplification of Equation 2 leading to closed form solutions across the region where heat is added (through combustion) is to assume that combustion takes place at a constant Mach number, i.e., the burn is a constant Mach number burn. Applying this assumption Equation 2 simplifies to Equation 3. Since the Mach number (M) is assumed constant, a closed form expression can be derived from the differential relation in Equation 3 relating area ratio and stagnation temperature ratio, resulting in Equation 4. In Equation 4 the subscript 1 refers to the beginning of the burn region and the subscript 2 denotes the end of the burn region. Also, a relation for stagnation pressure ratio across the burn region can be derived from the constant burn-Mach number assumption; the resulting expression is shown in Equation 5. Equation 5 in conjunction with standard isentropic flow relations in the pre-burn and post-burn regions of the nozzle flow can be used to provide an estimate of the one-dimensional behavior and performance of the variable-area-heat-addition control of exit (test) Mach number.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Flame stabilization is controlled by either geometrical changes within the device or by a flow induced means. Geometric techniques include cavities that create a sidewall depression, steps that protrude into the flow, and alterations including ramps that cause a reduction in flow velocity or recirculation zones. Any disturbance in a supersonic flow can create an oblique or bow shock that induces discontinuities of temperature that can act as a point of ignition. Also, certain flow induced injection techniques utilizing a fuel, oxidizer, or combination thereof, can cause an intense initial reaction that will stabilize the flame.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In embodiments of the present invention, the exit plane <b>24</b> is dimensioned and configured to withstand final total temperatures ranging from about 100° C. to about 5000° C., total pressures ranging from about 200 psia to about 2000 psia, and pressure flows having variable Mach numbers ranging from about 2 to about 6. In other embodiments, the exit plane <b>24</b> is dimensioned and configured to withstand final total temperatures ranging from about 100° C. to about 5000° C., total pressures ranging from about 200 psia to about 4000 psia, and pressure flows having variable Mach numbers ranging from about 2 to about 6. The exit plane <b>24</b> produces variable supersonic Mach speeds ranges comprising at least one of about 2.6 to about 2.93, about 2 to about 3, about 5.5 to about 6.5, about 5 to about 6, about 5 to about 7, about 6 to about 8, and about 6 to about 7.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention also includes a method of using a supersonic combustion air heater <b>10</b> comprising: providing a starting pressure flow which is expanded through a throat, the pressure flow having a starting total temperature To<sub>1 </sub>and a starting total pressure Po<sub>1</sub>, wherein said total temperature is greater than 0° C.; providing a fixed geometry nozzle having a throat, converging area, and diverging area, wherein the throat is located between the converging area and the diverging area, wherein the diverging area is located downstream of the throat, wherein the throat withstands the pressure flow at Mach 1; providing at least one fuel injection means and at least one flame stabilization means located in the divergent area, wherein the fuel injection means includes a combustible fuel injection means for ignition and for increasing total temperature of the pressure flow in the diverging area, wherein the diverging area having Mach numbers greater than 1; and providing an exit plane adjacent and downstream to the diverging area, wherein the exit plane having a final total pressure Po<sub>2</sub>, and a final total temperature defined as To<sub>2</sub>, wherein the final total temperature is up to about 10,000° C., wherein a first injection fuel means and a first flame stabilization means is located in the diverging area depending on the dimensions and configurations of the diverging area, the total temperature within the diverging area, and the desired exit plane Mach numbers, wherein a total pressure ratio Po<sub>2</sub>/Po<sub>1 </sub>of up to about 1 which is measured from the starting total pressure and the final total pressure, and the Mach numbers produced at the exit plane, wherein the exit plane Mach is varied by heat addition in the diverging area by at least one fuel injection means and at least one stabilization means, wherein at the exit plane variable supersonic Mach numbers range from between about 1.5 to about 8.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Experimental Results</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The following experiments are exemplary and explanatory only and are not to be viewed as being restrictive of the present invention, as claimed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the results of a one dimensional analysis which concludes that the exit Mach number can be varied by adding varying amounts of heat, or fuel (in effect, varying the equivalence ratio) over a specified region in the diverging section. Different exit Mach numbers were obtained in the analysis when different amounts of heat were added at the same initial Mach number location. The analysis also concluded that it is critical to add the heat in as low of a Mach number region as possible, so as to reduce the loss of total pressure (the ratio Po2/Po1 is as close to 1 as possible). A specific example of these results includes the following.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In Case A, in Table 1, beginning with a total temperature (To<sub>1</sub>) of 1300 K, the total temperature was raised by 800 K over length x, starting at a region with a Mach number of 1.5 (Mach<sub>burn</sub>), resulting in a total temperature (To<sub>2</sub>) of 2100 K. This resulted in an exit Mach number of 8 (M<sub>exit</sub>) with a total pressure ratio Po<sub>2</sub>/Po<sub>1 </sub>equal to 0.47. Here, A1/Ath is the ratio of area at the start of the heat addition, which is coincident with centerline reference point <b>22</b>, which is movable as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (items <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C) moving to a position that is a function of a fuel oxygen mixture, to the area of the throat <b>18</b>, A2/Ath is the ratio of area at the end of heat addition, where the area at the end of heat addition is determined by the flame stabilization point within diverging area <b>50</b> to the area of the throat <b>18</b>, and A3/Ath is the ratio of the area at the exit plane <b>24</b> to the area of the throat <b>18</b>. In Case B, in Table 1, beginning with the same initial total temperature of 1300K and raising it again by 800K, but this time adding the heat starting at a Mach number of 2.0, results in a final total pressure ratio Po<sub>2</sub>/Po<sub>1 </sub>equal to 0.26. Thus adding the same amount of heat, but at the lower Mach number results in much less loss of total pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Table 1 also provides an example of a one-dimensional analysis that was conducted to determine the relative scale a system would need to be in terms of exit area ratio to achieve a Mach number of about 8 at the exit plane. The analysis shows two scenarios in which the exit plane to throat area ratio would be as large as 925.37 or as small as 514.25, depending on whether the heat addition began at an area ratio of 1.6875 (Mach number of 2.0) or 1.176 (Mach number of 1.5), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The two cases presented in Table 2 provide an example of two conditions that might occur in an actual test. Case A in Table 2 starts with an initial total temperature of 1300 K and raising the total temperature by 800 K, the final Mach number is 6.5. In case B the initial total temperature is 690 K, the total temperature was increased by 880 K starting at a region with a Mach number of 1.5, as in Case A. This resulted in an exit Mach number of 5.5 with a total pressure ratio Po<sub>2</sub>/Po<sub>1 </sub>equal to 0.27.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an actual test of an air-breathing engine requiring variable Mach number operation from 5.5 to 6.5 the device would operate continuously over the range of final Mach number from 5.5 to 6.5 The total temperature and total pressure of the initial pressure flow would be changing as well as the amount of heat added. The starting position for heat addition would remain the same. As can be seen the very highest total temperatures are only in the supersonic (diverging) section of the nozzle.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Experiments at the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWCWD) utilize a hydrogen-fueled supersonic combustion heater to add enthalpy to the flow after it is expanded to a supersonic condition in the diverging section of the nozzle where the flow static temperature and static pressure are relatively low. As a result, high enthalpy flows suitable for hypersonic ground testing can be generated without creating excessive heat transfer at the nozzle throat. Ultimately, this will reduce the cost and increase the reliability of large, high-temperature vitiated air heaters. To date proof-of-concept experiments have been conducted that used the supersonic combustion heater to produce a nominal Mach 3 jet with 2000 K total temperature. This supersonic combustion heater features a unique technology for flame holding in the supersonic air stream (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/337,667) that makes the combustion efficient and the combustor scalable from its current flow rate of 1-2 lbm/sec to 100-200 lbm/sec and more.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The ability to vary the exit Mach number has an important application to testing air breathing engine mode transition. Future air breathing hypersonic vehicles will need to rely upon multiple modes of engine operation to operate over their entire flight envelope. For example a missile may begin flight using a turbine-based engine cycle, or mode, to reach Mach 5 and transition to scramjet mode of operation to reach Mach 7 and beyond. The transition between subsonic combustion (in a turbine) and scramjet modes is a critical phase of flight and ground tests of this cycle change will require that a free jet facility be capable of varying the delivered Mach number from Mach 5 to Mach 7, for example. Wider variations of Mach number may be desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The results of a 1-D analysis that demonstrates the potential for Mach number variability using this supersonic combustion air heater are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. The analysis assumes a Mach 3 nozzle with total temperature and total pressure of 300 K and 500 psia respectively. By varying the starting location of heat addition, length of heat addition, or amount of heat addition the final Mach number can be varied for a fixed geometry nozzle. The experiments have demonstrated variable Mach number when the fuel-air equivalence ratio is changed from 0.78 to 0.32 in two tests. It was found that the exit Mach number varied from 2.64 to 2.93 for these two different fuel-air equivalence ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Several techniques will be used to obtain the desired final Mach number. The incoming air flow will be heated to some initial total temperature T<sub>0 </sub>using a conventional subsonic heater prior to entering the supersonic combustor. Using the example given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, left unchanged this air flow would exit the supersonic combustor with a Mach number of 3. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as fuel is burned in the supersonic combustor raising the total temperature of the flow as an example from 300K to 560K the exit Mach number would decrease from 3 to 1.3. Alternatively, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the starting location of heat addition could be varied. Assuming a constant amount of heat addition and therefore a constant final total temperature, as the location for fuel injection and therefore heat addition moves downstream the final Mach number decreases. Thus, the total temperature is constant while the Mach number changes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> gives an example of the case where the length over which heat is added and the initial location is also varied. Various combinations of final total temperature and Mach number are possible using these techniques. Although the examples use a baseline exit plane Mach number of 3 and total temperature of 300K, this system would theoretically work for any combination of Mach number and total temperature. The goal of this effort is to develop a variable Mach number system that would span the range of about Mach 1.5-8 and total temperatures from 1000-6000 R.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Exit Mach number can depend on the heat-added zone placement and axial length within the diverging nozzle and the value of stagnation temperature reached downstream of the heat addition zone. The results of an analysis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> demonstrate these effects. The experimental results presented in Table 3 below demonstrate the sensible dependence of the exit Mach number on the amount of heat added to the flow as indicated by the downstream stagnation temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is known that with long-duration hypersonic flight come material problems. The present invention <b>10</b> is constructed to test materials, including radomes, flight surfaces, and inlets, at the high enthalpy of hypersonic flight; however, the supersonic combustion heater can be used for other non-related purposes. In addition, air-breathing propulsion systems for hypersonic platforms must be ground tested as well to characterize their performance at hypersonic flight speeds. In both cases high-enthalpy high-speed high-mass rate flow test facilities are required.</p>
