<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for purifying the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine and, particularly, of a diesel engine, contains NO<sub>x</sub>. Therefore, it has been suggested that a filter for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>should be arranged in the exhaust system. The particulate filter absorbs NO<sub>x </sub>in the form of nitric acid ions when the oxygen concentration of the surrounding atmosphere thereof is high and releases the absorbed NO<sub>x </sub>when the oxygen concentration of the surrounding atmosphere becomes low. Therefore, the particulate filter absorbs NO<sub>x </sub>favorably from an exhaust gas of a diesel engine in which the combustion takes place in an excess air condition. If the air-fuel ratio of the surrounding atmosphere is periodically made rich or stoichiometric and thus the oxygen concentration is made low, NO<sub>x </sub>is released from the particulate filter and thereafter the released NO<sub>x </sub>can be reduced by the reducing material such as HC and thus NO<sub>x </sub>can be purified before it is emitted into the outside of the engine exhaust system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By the way, the exhaust gas of a diesel engine also contains particulates comprising carbon as a chief component. The particulates are required to be treated before they are emitted into the outside of the engine exhaust system. Thus, it has been suggested that a particulate filter should be arranged in the exhaust system to trap the particulate. If such a particulate filter carries the above-mentioned catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x</sub>, the particulate filter can absorb NO<sub>x </sub>and can also oxidize and remove the particulates. Thus, it is effective for the purifying of the exhaust gas that a particulate filter carrying the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>is arranged in the exhaust system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The structure of the particulate filter is usually a wall-flow type in which the exhaust gas passes through the pores of the trapping wall. Therefore, the area for carrying the catalyst on the trapping wall with which the exhaust gas is mainly in contact is necessarily smaller than that an usual particulate filter, and thus the particulate filter carrying the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>cannot purify sufficiently NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas by itself. Besides, if the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>carried on the particulate filter is covered with the trapped particulates, the catalyst cannot absorb sufficiently NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas. Therefore, the particulate filter cannot sufficiently purify the NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas by itself.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a device for purifying the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine, which can purify NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas more sufficiently than the particulate filter carrying the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided a first device for purifying the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine comprising: a particulate filter, arranged in the exhaust system, which carries a catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x</sub>, the catalyst absorbing NO<sub>x </sub>when the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere thereof is lean and releasing the absorbed NO<sub>x </sub>to purify NO<sub>x </sub>by reduction when said air-fuel ratio is the stoichiometric or rich; and a catalytic apparatus, for purifying NO<sub>x</sub>, arranged in the exhaust system upstream the particulate filter, which has an oxidation function.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, there is provided a second device for purifying the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine comprising: a particulate filter, arranged in the exhaust system, which carries an oxidation catalyst, and a catalytic apparatus for purifying NO<sub>x </sub>arranged in the exhaust system upstream the particulate filter.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in the embodiment of the present invention, the fuel injector <b>6</b> comprises a nozzle having six nozzle holes. Fuel sprays (F) are injected from the nozzle holes in slightly downward direction against a horizontal plane with equal angular intervals. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, two fuel sprays (F) of the six fuel sprays (F) are scattered along the lower surface of each exhaust valve <b>9</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show the case where fuel is injected at the end of the compression stroke. In this case, the fuel sprays (F) progress toward the inside periphery surface of the cavity <b>5</b> and, thereafter, is ignited and burned.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the case in that additional fuel is injected from the fuel injector <b>6</b> when the lifting amount of the exhaust valves is the maximum in the exhaust stroke. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the case that the main fuel injection (Qm) is carried out close to the compression top dead center and thereafter the additional fuel injection (Qa) is carried out in the middle stage of the exhaust stroke. In this case, the fuel sprays (F) that progress toward the exhaust valves <b>9</b> are directed between the umbrella-like back surface of the exhaust valve <b>9</b> and the exhaust port <b>10</b>. In other words, two nozzle holes, of the six nozzle holes of the fuel injector <b>6</b>, are formed such that when the exhaust valves <b>9</b> are opened and the additional fuel injection (Qa) is carried out, the fuel sprays (F) are directed between the back surface of the exhaust valve <b>9</b> and the exhaust port <b>10</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, these fuel sprays (F) impinge on the back surface of the exhaust valve <b>9</b> and reflect from the back surface of the exhaust valves <b>9</b>, and thus are directed into the exhaust port <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Usually, the additional fuel injection (Qa) is not carried out, and the main fuel injection (Qm) only is carried out. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> indicates an example of an experiment showing the change in the output torque and the amount of smoke, HC, CO, and NO<sub>x </sub>exhausted at that time when changing the air-fuel ratio A/F (abscissa in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) by changing the opening degree of the throttle valve <b>16</b> and the EGR rate at the time of low engine load operation. As will be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in this experiment, the smaller the air-fuel ratio A/F becomes, the larger the EGR rate becomes. When the air-fuel ratio is below the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (nearly equal 14.6), the EGR rate becomes over 65 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the EGR rate is increased to reduce the air-fuel ratio A/F, when the EGR rate becomes close to 40 percent and the air-fuel ratio A/F becomes about 30, the amount of produced smoke starts to increase. Next, when the EGR rate is further increased and the air-fuel ratio A/F is made smaller, the amount of produced smoke sharply increases and peaks. Next, when the EGR rate is further increased and the air-fuel ratio A/F is made smaller, the amount of produced smoke sharply decreases. When the EGR rate is made over 65 percent and the air-fuel ratio A/F becomes close to 15.0, the amount of produced smoke is substantially zero. That is, almost no soot is produced. At this time, the output torque of the engine falls somewhat and the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>becomes considerably lower. On the other hand, at this time, the amounts of produced HC and CO start to increase.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref> shows the changes in combustion pressure in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> when the amount of produced smoke is the greatest near an air-fuel ratio A/F of 21. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref> shows the changes in combustion pressure in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> when the amount of produced smoke is substantially zero near an air-fuel ratio A/F of 18. As will be understood from a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, the combustion pressure is lower in the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, where the amount of produced smoke is substantially zero, than the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref> where the amount of produced smoke is large.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The following may be said from the results of the experiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. That is, first, when the air-fuel ratio A/F is less than 15.0 and the amount of produced smoke is substantially zero, the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>decreases considerably as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The fact that the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>decreases means that the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> falls. Therefore, it can be said that when almost no soot is produced, the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> becomes lower. The same fact can be said from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. That is, in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref> where almost no soot is produced, the combustion pressure becomes lower, therefore the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> becomes lower at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Second, when the amount of produced smoke, that is, the amount of produced soot, becomes substantially zero, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the amounts of exhausted HC and CO increase. This means that the hydrocarbons are exhausted without changing into soot. That is, the straight chain hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons contained in the fuel and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> decompose when raised in temperature in an oxygen insufficient state resulting in the formation of a precursor of soot. Next, soot mainly composed of solid masses of carbon atoms is produced. In this case, the actual process of production of soot is complicated. How the precursor of soot is formed is not clear, but whatever the case, the hydrocarbons shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> change to soot through the soot precursor. Therefore, as explained above, when the amount of production of soot becomes substantially zero, the amount of exhaust of HC and CO increases as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, but the HC at this time is a soot precursor or in a state of a hydrocarbon before that.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Summarizing these considerations based on the results of the experiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, when the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> is low, the amount of produced soot becomes substantially zero. At this time, a soot precursor or a state of hydrocarbons before that is exhausted from the combustion chamber <b>5</b>. More detailed experiments and studies were conducted. As a result, it was learned that when the temperature of the fuel and the gas around the fuel in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> is below a certain temperature, the process of growth of soot stops midway, that is, no soot at all is produced and that when the temperature of the fuel and the gas around the fuel in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> becomes higher than the certain temperature, soot is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The temperature of the fuel and the gas around the fuel when the process of growth of hydrocarbons stops in the state of the soot precursor, that is, the above certain temperature, changes depending on various factors such as the type of the fuel, the air-fuel ratio, and the compression ratio, so it cannot be said exactly what it is, but this certain temperature is deeply related to the amount of production of NO<sub>x</sub>. Therefore, this certain temperature can be defined to a certain degree from the amount of production of NO<sub>x</sub>. That is, the greater the EGR rate is, the lower the temperature of the fuel, and the gas around it at the time of combustion, becomes and the lower the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>becomes. At this time, when the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>becomes around 10 ppm or less, almost no soot is produced any more. Therefore, the above certain temperature substantially corresponds to the temperature when the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>becomes around 10 ppm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Once soot is produced, it is impossible to purify it by after-treatment using a catalyst having an oxidation function. As opposed to this, a soot precursor or a state of hydrocarbons before that can be easily purified by after-treatment using a catalyst having an oxidation function. Thus, it is extremely effective for the purifying of the exhaust gas that the hydrocarbons are exhausted from the combustion chamber <b>5</b> in the form of a soot precursor or a state before that with the reduction of the amount of produced NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Now, to stop the growth of hydrocarbons in the state before the production of soot, it is necessary to suppress the temperature of the fuel and the gas around it at the time of combustion in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> to a temperature lower than the temperature where soot is produced. In this case, it was learned that the heat absorbing action of the gas around the fuel at the time of combustion of the fuel has an extremely great effect in suppression the temperatures of the fuel and the gas around it.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">That is, if only air exists around the fuel, the vaporized fuel will immediately react with the oxygen in the air and burn. In this case, the temperature of the air away from the fuel does not rise so much. Only the temperature around the fuel becomes locally extremely high. That is, at this time, the air away from the fuel does not absorb much of the heat of combustion of the fuel at all. In this case, since the combustion temperature becomes extremely high locally, the unburned hydrocarbons receiving the heat of combustion produce soot.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On the other hand, when fuel exists in a mixed gas of a large amount of inert gas and a small amount of air, the situation is somewhat different. In this case, the evaporated fuel disperses in the surroundings and reacts with the oxygen mixed in the inert gas to burn. In this case, the heat of combustion is absorbed by the surrounding inert gas, so the combustion temperature no longer rises so much. That is, the combustion temperature can be kept low. That is, the presence of inert gas plays an important role in the suppression of the combustion temperature. It is possible to keep the combustion temperature low by the heat absorbing action of the inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this case, to suppress the temperature of the fuel and the gas around it to a temperature lower than the temperature at which soot is produced, an amount of inert gas sufficient to absorb an amount of heat sufficient to lower the temperature is required. Therefore, if the amount of fuel increases, the amount of required inert gas increases. Note that, in this case, the larger the specific heat of the inert gas is, the stronger the heat absorbing action becomes. Therefore, a gas with a large specific heat is preferable as the inert gas. In this regard, since CO<sub>2 </sub>and EGR gas have relatively large specific heats, it may be said to be preferable to use EGR gas as the inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the relationship between the EGR rate and smoke when using EGR gas as the inert gas and changing the degree of cooling of the EGR gas. That is, the curve (A) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the case of strongly cooling the EGR gas and maintaining the temperature of the EGR gas at about 90 degrees C., the curve (B) shows the case of cooling the EGR gas by a compact cooling apparatus, and the curve (C) shows the case of not compulsorily cooling the EGR gas.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When strongly cooling the EGR gas as shown by the curve (A) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the amount of produced soot peaks when the EGR rate is a slightly below 50 percent. In this case, if the EGR rate is made about 55 percent or higher, almost no soot is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">On the other hand, when the EGR gas is slightly cooled as shown by the curve (B) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the amount of produced soot peaks when the EGR rate is slightly higher than 50 percent. In this case, if the EGR rate is made above about 65 percent, almost no soot is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, when the EGR gas is not forcibly cooled as shown by the curve (C) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the amount of produced soot peaks near an EGR rate of 55 percent. In this case, if the EGR rate is made over about 70 percent, almost no soot is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the amount of produced smoke when the engine load is relatively high. When the engine load becomes smaller, the EGR rate at which the amount of produced soot peaks falls somewhat, and the lower limit of the EGR rate, at which almost no soot is produced, also falls somewhat. In this way, the lower limit of the EGR rate at which almost no soot is produced changes in accordance with the degree of cooling of the EGR gas or the engine load.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the amount of mixed EGR gas and air, the ratio of air in the mixed gas, and the ratio of EGR gas in the mixed gas, required to make the temperature of the fuel and the gas around it, at the time of combustion, a temperature lower than the temperature at which soot is produced in the case of the use of EGR gas as an inert gas. Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the ordinate shows the total amount of suction gas taken into the combustion chamber <b>5</b>. The broken line (Y) shows the total amount of suction gas able to be taken into the combustion chamber <b>5</b> when supercharging is not being performed. Further, the abscissa shows the required load. (Z<b>1</b>) shows the low engine load operation region.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the ratio of air, that is, the amount of air in the mixed gas shows the amount of air necessary for causing the injected fuel to completely burn. That is, in the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the ratio of the amount of air and the amount of injected fuel becomes the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. On the other hand, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the ratio of EGR gas, that is, the amount of EGR gas in the mixed gas, shows the minimum amount of EGR gas required for making the temperature of the fuel, and the gas around it, a temperature lower than the temperature at which soot is produced when the injected fuel has burned completely. This amount of EGR gas is, expressed in term of the EGR rate, equal to or larger than 55 percent and, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is equal to or larger than 70 percent. That is, if the total amount of suction gas taken into the combustion chamber <b>5</b> is made the solid line (X) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and the ratio between the amount of air and the amount of EGR gas in the total amount of suction gas (X) is made the ratio shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the temperature of the fuel and the gas around it becomes a temperature lower than the temperature at which soot is produced and therefore, no soot at all is produced. Further, the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>at this time is about 10 ppm or less and therefore the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>becomes extremely small.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If the amount of injected fuel increases, the amount of generated heat at the time of combustion increases, so, to maintain the temperature of the fuel and the gas around it at a temperature lower than the temperature at which soot is produced, the amount of heat absorbed by the EGR gas must be increased. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the amount of EGR gas has to be increased with an increase in the amount of injected fuel. That is, the amount of EGR gas has to be increased as the required engine load becomes higher.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">On the other hand, in the engine load region (Z<b>2</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the total amount of suction gas (X) required for inhibiting the production of soot exceeds the total amount of suction gas (Y) that can be taken in. Therefore, in this case, to supply the total amount of suction gas (X), required for inhibiting the production of soot, into the combustion chamber <b>5</b>, it is necessary to supercharge or pressurize both the EGR gas and the intake air or just the EGR gas. When not supercharging or pressurizing the EGR gas etc., in the engine load region (Z<b>2</b>), the total amount of suction gas (X) corresponds to the total amount of suction gas (Y) that can be taken in. Therefore, in this case, to inhibit the production of soot, the amount of air is reduced somewhat to increase the amount of EGR gas and the fuel is made to burn in a state where the air-fuel ratio is rich.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As explained above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the case of combustion of fuel at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. In the low engine load operating region (Z<b>1</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, even if the amount of air is made smaller than the amount of air shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, that is, even if the air-fuel ratio is made rich, it is possible to inhibit the production of soot and make the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>around 10 ppm or less. Further, in the low engine load operating region (Z<b>1</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, even if the amount of air is made greater than the amount of air shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, that is, the average air-fuel ratio is made lean of 17 to 18, it is possible to inhibit the production of soot and make the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>around 10 ppm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">That is, when the air-fuel ratio is made rich, the fuel is in excess, but since the combustion temperature is suppressed to a low temperature, the excess fuel does not change into soot and therefore soot is not produced. Further, at this time, only an extremely small amount of NO<sub>x </sub>is produced. On the other hand, when the average of air-fuel ratio is lean or when the air-fuel ratio is the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, a small amount of soot is produced if the combustion temperature becomes higher, but the combustion temperature is suppressed to a low temperature, and thus no soot at all is produced. Further, only an extremely small amount of NO<sub>x </sub>is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this way, in the low engine load operating region (Z<b>1</b>), despite the air-fuel ratio, that is, whether the air fuel ratio is rich or the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio, or the average of air-fuel ratio is lean, no soot is produced and the amount of produced NO<sub>x </sub>becomes extremely small. Therefore, considering the improvement of the fuel consumption rate, it may be said to be preferable to make the average air-fuel ratio lean.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">By the way, only when the engine load is relative low and the amount of generated heat is small, can the temperature of the fuel and the gas around the fuel in the combustion be suppressed to below a temperature at which the process of growth of soot stops midway. Therefore, in the embodiment of the present invention, when the engine load is relative low, the temperature of the fuel and the gas around the fuel in the combustion is suppressed to below a temperature at which the process of growth of soot stops midway and thus a first combustion, i.e., a low temperature combustion, is carried out. When the engine load is relative high, a second combustion, i.e., normal combustion, as usual, is carried out. Here, as can be understood from the above explanation, the first combustion, i.e., the low temperature combustion is a combustion in which the amount of inert gas in the combustion chamber is larger than the worst amount of inert gas causing the maximum amount of produced soot and thus no soot at all is produced. The second combustion, i.e., the normal combustion is a combustion in which the amount of inert gas in the combustion chamber is smaller than the worst amount of inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a first operating region (I) in which the first combustion, i.e., the low temperature combustion is carried out and a second operating region (II) in which the second combustion, i.e., the normal combustion is carried out. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the ordinate (L) shows the amount of depression of the accelerator pedal <b>40</b>, i.e., the required engine load. The abscissa (N) shows the engine speed. Further, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, X(N) shows a first boundary between the first operating region (I) and the second operating region (II). Y(N) shows a second boundary between the first operating region (I) and the second operating region (II). The decision of changing from the first operating region (I) to the second operating region (II) is carried out on the basis of the first boundary X(N). The decision of changing from the second operating region (II) to the first operating region (I) is carried out on the basis of the second boundary Y(N).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">That is, when the engine operating condition is in the first operating region (I) and the low temperature combustion is carried out, if the required engine load (L) increases beyond the first boundary X(N) that is a function of the engine speed (N), it is determined that the engine operating region shifts in the second operating region (II) and thus the normal combustion is carried out. Thereafter, if the required engine load (L) decreases below the second boundary Y(N) that is a function of the engine speed (N), it is determined that the engine operating region shifts in the first operating region (I) and thus the low temperature combustion is carried out again.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the output of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the output current (I) of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>21</b> changes in accordance with the air-fuel ratio A/F. Accordingly, the air-fuel ratio can be known from the output current (I) of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>21</b>. Next, referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the engine operating control in the first operating region (I) and the second operating region (II) will be explained schematically.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the opening degree of the throttle valve <b>16</b>, the opening degree of the EGR control valve <b>23</b>, the EGR rate, the air-fuel ratio, the fuel injection timing, and the amount of injected fuel with respect to the required engine load (L). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in the first operating region (I) when the required engine load (L) is low, the throttle valve <b>16</b> is gradually opened from near the fully closed state to near the half opened state along with the increase of the required engine load (L), and the EGR control valve <b>23</b> is gradually opened from near the fully closed state to the fully opened state along with the increase in the required engine load (L). In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the EGR rate in the first operating region (I) is made about 70 percent and the air-fuel ratio therein is made slightly lean.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the other words, in the first operating region (I), the opening degrees of the throttle valve <b>16</b> and the EGR control valve <b>23</b> are controlled such that the EGR rate becomes about 70 percent and the air-fuel ratio becomes a slightly lean air-fuel ratio. The air-fuel ratio at this time is controlled to the target air-fuel ratio to correct the opening degree of the EGR control valve <b>23</b> on the basis of the output signal of the air-fuel ratio sensor <b>21</b>. In the first operating region (I), the fuel is injected before the compression top dead center TDC.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When in the idle operating mode, the throttle valve <b>16</b> is closed to near the fully closed state. At this time, the EGR control valve <b>23</b> is also closed to near the fully closed state. When the throttle valve <b>16</b> is closed near the fully closed state, the pressure in the combustion chamber <b>5</b> in the initial stage of the compression stroke is made low and thus the compression pressure becomes low. When the compression pressure becomes low, the compression work of the piston <b>4</b> becomes small and thus the vibration of the engine body <b>1</b> becomes small.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">On the other hand, when the engine operating region changes from the first operating region (I) to the second operating region (II), the opening degree of the throttle valve <b>16</b> increases by a step from the half opened state toward the fully opened state.

The changeover portion <b>71</b> comprises a valve body <b>71</b><i>a </i>that shuts off the flow of exhaust gas in the changeover portion <b>71</b>. The valve body <b>71</b><i>a </i>is driven by a negative pressure actuator, a step motor or the like.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates another shut-off position of the valve body <b>71</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows the structure of the particulate filter <b>70</b>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(A)</figref> is a front view of the particulate filter <b>70</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(B)</figref> is a side sectional view thereof. As shown in these figures, the particulate filter <b>70</b> has an elliptic shape, and is, for example, the wall-flow type of a honeycomb structure formed of a porous material such as cordierite, and has many spaces in the axial direction divided by many partition walls <b>54</b> extending in the axial direction. One of any two neighboring spaces is closed by a plug <b>52</b> on the exhaust gas downstream side, and the other one is closed by a plug <b>53</b> on the exhaust gas upstream side. Thus, one of the two neighboring spaces serves as an exhaust gas flow-in passage <b>50</b> and the other one serves as an exhaust gas flow-out passage <b>51</b>, causing the exhaust gas to necessarily pass through the partition wall <b>54</b> as indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(B)</figref>. The particulates contained in the exhaust gas are much smaller than the pores of the partition wall <b>54</b>, but collide with and are trapped on the exhaust gas upstream side surface of the partition wall <b>54</b> and the pores surface in the partition wall <b>54</b>. Thus, each partition wall <b>54</b> works as a trapping wall for trapping the particulates. In the present particulate filter <b>70</b>, in order to oxidize and remove the trapped particulates, an NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent and a noble metal catalyst as platinum Pt, which will be explained below, are carried on both side surfaces of the partition wall <b>54</b>, and preferably also on the pore surfaces in the partition wall <b>54</b>, by using an alumina or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the present embodiment, the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent carried on the partition wall <b>54</b> is at least one selected from alkali metals such as potassium K, sodium Na, lithium Li, cesium Cs, and rubidium Rb, alkali earth metals such as barium Ba, calcium Ca, and strontium Sr, rare earth elements such as lanthanum La and yttrium Y, and transition metals. The NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent absorbs NO<sub>x </sub>when the air-fuel ratio (that is a ratio of the supplied air to the supplied fuel regardless of an amount of fuel burned by using oxygen in the supplied air) in the surrounding atmosphere is lean and releases the absorbed NO<sub>x </sub>when the air-fuel ratio becomes stoichiometric or rich, and thus the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent carries out the absorbing and releasing actions of NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent can actually carry out the absorbing and releasing actions of NO<sub>x</sub>, but a part of the mechanism of the absorbing and releasing actions of NO<sub>x </sub>is not clear. However, it is believed that the absorbing and releasing actions of NO<sub>x </sub>takes place by the mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23(A) and 23(B)</figref>. Next, explained below is the mechanism with reference to the case where platinum Pt and barium Ba are carried on the partition wall of the particulate filter. The mechanism is the same as in the case of using another noble metal and another alkali metal, an alkali earth metal, or a rare earth element.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Whether in the low temperature combustion or the normal combustion, when the air-fuel ratio is lean, oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is high. At this time, oxygen O<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaust gas adheres onto the surface of platinum Pt in the form of O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> or O<sup>2−</sup> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(A)</figref>. On the other hand, NO in the exhaust gas reacts with O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> or O<sup>2−</sup> on the surface of platinum Pt to produce NO<sub>2 </sub>(2NO+O<sub>2</sub>→2NO<sub>2</sub>). Next, a part of the produced NO<sub>2 </sub>is absorbed in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent while being oxidized on platinum Pt, and diffuses in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent in the form of nitric acid ion NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> while being combined with barium oxide BaO as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(A)</figref>. Thus, in the present embodiment, NO<sub>x </sub>contained in the exhaust gas is absorbed in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent. As long as oxygen concentration in the surrounding atmosphere is high, NO<sub>2 </sub>is produced on the surface of platinum Pt, and as long as the ability for absorbing NO<sub>x </sub>of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent does not saturate, NO<sub>2 </sub>is absorbed in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent to produce nitric acid ions NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">On the other hand, when the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere is made rich, the oxygen concentration drops. As a result, an amount of NO<sub>2 </sub>produced on the surface of platinum Pt drops. When the amount of produced NO<sub>2 </sub>drops, the reaction reverses (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>→NO<sub>2</sub>) and thus nitric acid ions NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent are released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent in the form of NO<sub>2</sub>. At this time, NO<sub>x </sub>released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent is reduced to react with HC, CO, or the like contained in the surrounding atmosphere, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(B)</figref>. Thus, when NO<sub>2 </sub>does not exist on the surface of platinum Pt, NO<sub>2 </sub>is released from NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent. Accordingly, when the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere is made rich, all of the absorbed NO<sub>x </sub>is released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent in a short time. The released NO<sub>x </sub>is reduced and thus NO<sub>x </sub>is not discharged to the outside of the exhaust system.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Even when the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere is made stoichiometric, NO<sub>x </sub>is released from NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent. However, in this case, NO<sub>x </sub>is released gradually from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent and thus a relative long period is required to release all of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">By the way, the ability for absorbing NO<sub>x </sub>in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent has a limit. Therefore, before the ability saturates, NO<sub>x </sub>must be released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent. Namely, before a current amount of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter <b>70</b> reaches the limit amount of NO<sub>x </sub>that can be absorbed therein, NO<sub>x </sub>must be released from the particulate filter and the released NO<sub>x </sub>must be reduced and purified. For the purpose, a current amount of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter must be estimated. In the present embodiment, a map of amounts of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter per a unit time (A) in the low temperature combustion is predetermined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(A)</figref>. In the map, amounts of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter per a unit time (A) are set as functions of a required engine load (L) and an engine speed (N). A map of amounts of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter per a unit time (B) in the normal combustion is predetermined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(B)</figref>. In the map, amounts of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter per a unit time (B) are set as functions of a required engine load (L) and an engine speed (N). Therefore, a current amount of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter can be estimated to integrate these amounts of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter per a unit time (A) and (B). Here, when the low temperature combustion takes place in a rich air-fuel ratio, the absorbed NO<sub>x </sub>is released and thus an amount of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter per a unit time (A) become a minus value. In the present embodiment, when the estimated amount of NO<sub>x </sub>absorbed in the particulate filter becomes more than a predetermined permissible value, the low temperature combustion is carried out at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio or a rich air-fuel ratio, fuel is injected into the cylinder in the exhaust stroke, or the like, and thus the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere of the particulate filter <b>70</b> is made stoichiometric or rich to regenerate the particulate filter. This condition is maintained till the regeneration of the particulate filter is finished. The smaller the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere is, the shorter the period in which this condition is maintained becomes.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">By the way, the particulate filter carrying the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent can favorably oxidize and remove the particulates trapped on the trapping walls. The mechanism is explained by using of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. As mentioned above, NO<sub>x </sub>is absorbed in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> in the form of nitric acid ions NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. When the particulate <b>62</b> adheres on the surface of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent, the oxygen concentration drops on the surface of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> with which the particulate <b>62</b> is in contact. As the oxygen concentration drops, there occurs a difference in the concentration from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> having a high oxygen concentration and, thus, oxygen in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> tends to migrate toward the surface of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> with which the particulate <b>62</b> is in contact. As a result, nitric acid ions NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> are decomposed into oxygen O and NO, whereby oxygen O migrates toward the surface of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> with which the particulate <b>62</b> is in contact, and NO is emitted to the external side from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b>. NO emitted to the outside is oxidized on platinum Pt on the downstream side and is absorbed again in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">On the other hand, oxygen O migrating toward the surface of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> with which the particulate <b>62</b> is in contact is the oxygen O decomposed from a compound such as a nitrate. Oxygen O decomposed from the compound has a high level of energy and exhibits a very high activity. Therefore, oxygen migrating toward the surface of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b>, with which the particulate <b>62</b> is in contact, is active-oxygen O. Upon coming into contact with active-oxygen O, the particulate <b>62</b> is oxidized without producing luminous flame in a short time of, for example, a few minutes or a few tens of minutes. Further, active-oxygen to oxidize the particulate <b>62</b> is also released when NO is absorbed in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b>. That is, it can be considered that NO<sub>x </sub>diffuses in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> in the form of nitric acid ions NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> while being combined with oxygen atoms and to be separated from an oxygen atom, and during this time, active-oxygen is produced. The particulates <b>62</b> are also oxidized by this active-oxygen. Further, the particulates adhered on the particulate filter <b>70</b> are oxidized not only by active-oxygen, but also by the oxygen contained in the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, if the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent and the noble metal catalyst (which are referred to as a catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>below) are carried on the particulate filter, the particulate filter is effective to purify NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas and to prevent blocking of the particulate filter meshes with oxidizing and removing the trapped particulates.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">However, as mentioned above, the structure of the particulate filter is the wall-flow type in which the exhaust gas passes through the pores of the trapping walls. Therefore, in comparison with a usual catalytic apparatus in which the exhaust gas flows along the partition walls carrying a catalyst, a dimension between the trapping walls of the particulate filter must be larger than a dimension between the partition walls of the catalytic apparatus so that the same amount of exhaust gas can pass through the same size particulate filter as the catalytic apparatus. Thus, a frequency in which the exhaust gas is in contact with the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>carried on the surface of the trapping wall of the particulate filter is smaller than a frequency in which the exhaust gas is in contact with the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>carried on the surface of the partition wall of the catalytic apparatus. Besides, when the exhaust gas can pass through the pores of the trapping wall, the exhaust gas is in contact with the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>carried in the pores, but the exhaust gas is mainly in contact with only the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>carried on the surface of the trapping wall. In the particulate filter, an area for carrying the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>on the surface of the trapping wall is relative small due to many pores. Thus, even if the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>is carried on the particulate filter, NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas cannot be sufficiently purified.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">To solve this problem, in the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, a catalytic apparatus for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub><b>74</b> is arranged upstream the changeover portion <b>71</b> in the exhaust pipe <b>18</b>. The catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> is to compensate the NO<sub>x </sub>purifying of the particulate filter <b>70</b> and thus does not need a large capacity. Accordingly, the catalytic apparatus for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub><b>74</b> and the particulate filter <b>70</b> carrying the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>can sufficiently purify NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas together.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> may carry the above-mentioned catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>or a catalyst for reducing NO<sub>x </sub>selectively on a honeycomb structure carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">By the way, a soluble organic fraction SOF is also contained in the exhaust gas. SOF has an adhesion property, adheres the particulates each other on the particulate filter, and thus makes the particulates become a large mass. This makes it difficult to oxidize and remove the particulates on the particulate filter and to keep open the filter meshes. If the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> carries a catalyst having an oxidation function such as the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x</sub>, the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> can burn SOF in the exhaust gas upstream the particulate filter <b>70</b> and thus can prevent blocking of the filter meshes.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">By the way, the fuel contains sulfur S and thus SO<sub>x </sub>is produced in the combustion of the fuel. SO<sub>x </sub>is absorbed in the form of sulfate in the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>carried on the particulate filter <b>70</b> due to a mechanism similar to that of the case of NO<sub>x</sub>. Sulfate can release active oxygen due to a mechanism similar to that of the case of nitrate. However, sulfate is stable and if the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere is made rich, sulfate is hardly released from the particulate filter. In fact, sulfate remains on the particulate filter and thus an amount of absorbed sulfate increase gradually. An amount of nitrate or sulfate that can be absorbed in the particulate filter has a limit. If an amount of absorbed sulfate in the particulate filter increases (this is referred to as SO<sub>x </sub>pollution, below), an amount of nitrate that can be absorbed in the particulate filter decreases. Finally, the particulate filter cannot absorb NO<sub>x</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the present embodiment, the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> carries the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>and thus the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> positively absorbs SO<sub>x </sub>upstream of the particulate filter <b>70</b>. Therefore, the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution of the particulate filter <b>70</b> can be prevented. However, the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution occurs in the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b>. The SO<sub>x </sub>pollution of the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> is avoided as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">First, it is determined if the recovery of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution is required. In this determination, when an amount of fuel consumed until now reaches a predetermined amount, it can be determined that the recovery of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution is required. Besides, also in the catalytic apparatus, the regeneration process for releasing NO<sub>x </sub>and purifying the released NO<sub>x </sub>is needed similarly to the particulate filter. In the regeneration process, the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas in the upstream side of the catalytic apparatus is made rich and reducing materials such as HC in the exhaust gas is used to reduce the released NO<sub>x</sub>. Therefore, the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas in the downstream side of the catalytic apparatus becomes about stoichiometric. On the other hand, when the regeneration finishes, the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas in the downstream side of the catalytic apparatus becomes rich similar to that in the upstream side thereof. By using this, if a regeneration period is detected, it can be determined that the recovery of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution is required because, when the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution progresses enough to require the recovery, an amount of absorbed NO<sub>x </sub>at the regeneration time is actually small so that the regeneration period is shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When it is determined that the recovery of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution is required, the combustion air-fuel ratio is made lean and thus a large amount of oxygen is contained in the exhaust gas. Simultaneously, fuel is injected into the cylinder in the exhaust stroke or fuel injected into the exhaust system upstream the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b> or the like. Thus, a sufficient amount of oxygen and a reducing material such as un-burned fuel are supplied to the catalytic apparatus. Therefore, the reducing material burns favorably due to the oxidation function of the catalytic apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Thus, the temperature of the catalytic apparatus rises about 600 degrees C. and thus the stable sulfate can be released as SO<sub>x </sub>when the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere is made stoichiometric or rich and the oxygen concentration drops. If the temperature of the catalytic apparatus rises over 700 degrees C., the oxidation catalyst such as platinum Pt sinters and thus the oxidation function thereof drops. Therefore, the temperature of the exhaust gas immediately downstream of the catalytic apparatus is monitored and it is preferred to prevent the sintering of the oxidation catalyst. In the recovery process of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution of the catalytic apparatus, the valve body <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the changeover portion <b>71</b> is set the middle position. Therefore, the released SO<sub>x </sub>from the catalytic apparatus bypasses the particulate filter <b>70</b> and the released SO<sub>x </sub>from the catalytic apparatus is not absorbed in the particulate filter again. When the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere is made rich for a predetermined time after the temperature of the catalytic apparatus is made high, it can be determined that the recovery process of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution finishes and the combustion air-fuel ratio is returned to the normal air-fuel ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">By the way, the higher the temperature of the particulate filter becomes, the more the platinum Pt and the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> are activated. Therefore, the higher the temperature of the particulate filter becomes, the larger the amount of active-oxygen O released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> per unit time becomes. Further, naturally, the higher the temperature of particulates is, the easier the particulates are oxidized. Therefore, the amount of particulates that can be oxidized and removed without producing luminous flame on the particulate filter per unit time increases along with an increase in the temperature of the particulate filter. Therefore, if the valve body <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the changeover portion <b>71</b> is set to one of the two shut-off positions simultaneously with or immediately after the finishing of the recovery process of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution of the catalytic apparatus <b>74</b>, the high temperature (600 degrees C.) of the exhaust gas is led to the particulate filter. Therefore, the temperature of the particulate filter rises and the particulates on the particulate filter are oxidized and removed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed without producing luminous flame per unit time. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the abscissa represents the temperature (TF) of the particulate filter. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows the case that the unit time is 1 second, that is, the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed per 1 second. However, any time such as 1 minute, 10 minutes, or the like can be selected as a unit time. For example, in the case that 10 minutes is used as unit time, the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed per unit time represents the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed per 10 minutes. In this case also, the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed without producing luminous flame increases along with an increase in the temperature of particulate filter <b>70</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The amount of particulates emitted from the combustion chamber per unit time is referred to as an amount of emitted particulates (M). When the amount of emitted particulates (M) is smaller than the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed, for example, the amount of emitted particulates (M) per 1 second is smaller than the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed per 1 second or the amount of emitted particulates (M) per 10 minutes is smaller than the amount of particulates (G) that can be oxidized and removed per 10 minutes, that is, in the area (I) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the particulates emitted from the combustion chamber are all oxidized and removed without producing luminous flame successively on the particulate filter <b>70</b> for the above mentioned short time.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">On the other hand, when the amount of emitted particulates (M) is larger than the amount of particulates that can be oxidized and removed (G), that is, in the area (II) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the amount of active-oxygen is not sufficient for all particulates to be oxidized and removed successively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27(A)</figref> to (C) illustrate the manner of oxidation of the particulates in such a case.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">That is, in the case that the amount of active-oxygen is lacking for oxidizing all particulates, when the particulates <b>62</b> adheres on the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b>, only a part of the particulates is oxidized as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(A)</figref>, and the other part of the particulates that was not oxidized sufficiently remains on the exhaust gas upstream surface of the particulate filter. When the state where the amount of active-oxygen is lacking continues, a part of the particulates that was not oxidized remains on the exhaust gas upstream surface of the particulate filter successively. As a result, the exhaust gas upstream surface of the particulate filter is covered with the residual particulates <b>63</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The residual particulates <b>63</b> are gradually transformed into carbonaceous matter that can hardly be oxidized. Further, when the exhaust gas upstream surface is covered with the residual particulates <b>63</b>, the action of platinum Pt for oxidizing NO and SO<sub>2</sub>, and the action of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> for releasing active-oxygen are suppressed. The residual particulates <b>63</b> can be gradually oxidized over a relative long period. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(C)</figref>, other particulates <b>64</b> deposit on the residual particulates <b>63</b> one after the other, and when the particulates are deposited so as to laminate, even if they are the easily oxidized particulates, these particulates may not be oxidized since these particulates are separated away from platinum Pt or from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent. Accordingly, other particulates deposit successively on these particulates <b>64</b>. That is, when the state where the amount of emitted particulates (M) is larger than the amount of particulates that can be oxidized and removed (G) continues, the particulates deposit to laminate on the particulate filter.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Thus, in the area (I) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the particulates are oxidized and removed without producing luminous flame for the short time and in the area (II) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the particulates are deposited to laminate on the particulate filter. Therefore, the deposition of the particulates on the particulate filter can be prevented if the relationship between the amount of emitted particulates (M) and the amount of particulates that can be oxidized and removed (G) is in the area (I). As a result, a pressure loss of the exhaust gas in the particulate filter hardly changes and is maintained at a minimum pressure loss value that is nearly constant. Thus, the decrease of the engine output can be maintained as low as possible. However, this is not always realized, and the particulates may deposit on the particulate filter if nothing is done.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the present embodiment, to prevent the deposition of particulates on the particulate filter, the above electronic control unit <b>30</b> controls the valve body <b>71</b><i>a </i>according to a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The present flowchart is repeated every a predetermined time. At step <b>101</b>, a running distance (A) is calculated, and at step <b>102</b>, it is determined if the running distance reaches a predetermined running distance (As). When the result is negative, the routine is stopped. However, when the result is positive, the routine goes to step <b>103</b> and the running distance is reset to 0. Thereafter, at step <b>104</b>, the valve body <b>71</b><i>a </i>is changed over from one of the two shut-off positions to the other shut-off position and thus the upstream side and the downstream side of the particulate filter are reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is an enlarged sectional view of the partition wall <b>54</b> of the particulate filter. While the vehicle travels over the predetermined running distance (As), the engine operation in the area (II) of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> can be carried out. Thus, the particulates collide with and are trapped by the exhaust gas upstream surface of the partition wall <b>54</b> and the exhaust gas opposing surface in the pores therein, i.e., one of the trapping surfaces of the partition wall <b>54</b>, and are oxidized and removed by active-oxygen released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent, but the particulates can remain for the insufficient oxidization as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(A)</figref>. At this stage, the exhaust resistance of the particulate filter does not have a bad influence on the traveling of the vehicle. However, if the particulates deposit more, problems in which the engine output drops considerably and the like occur. At this stage, the present flowchart reverses the upstream side and the downstream side of the particulate filter. Therefore, no particulates deposit again on the residual particulates on one of the trapping surfaces of the partition wall and thus the residual particulates can be gradually oxidized and removed by active-oxygen released from the one of the trapping surfaces. Further, in particular, the residual particulates in the pores in the partition wall are easily smashed into fine pieces by the exhaust gas flow in the reverse direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29(B)</figref>, and they mainly move through the pores toward the downstream side.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Accordingly, many of the particulates smashed into fine pieces diffuse in the pore in the partition wall, and they contact directly the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent carried on the pores surface and are oxidized and removed. Thus, if the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent is also carried on the pores surface in the partition wall, the residual particulates can be very easily oxidized and removed. On the other trapping surface that is now on the upstream side, as the flow of the exhaust gas is reversed, i.e., the exhaust gas upstream surface of the partition wall <b>54</b> and the exhaust gas opposing surface in the pores therein to which the exhaust gas mainly impinges (of the oppose side of one of the trapping surfaces), the particulates in the exhaust gas adhere newly thereto and are oxidized and removed by active-oxygen released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent. In this oxidization, a part of the active-oxygen released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent on the other trapping surface moves to the downstream side with the exhaust gas, and it is made to oxidize and remove the particulates that still remain on one of the trapping surfaces despite of the reversed flow of the exhaust gas.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">That is, the residual particulates on one of the trapping surfaces are exposed to not only active-oxygen released from this trapping surface but also the remainder of the active-oxygen used for oxidizing and removing the particulates on the other trapping surface by reversing the flow of the exhaust gas. Therefore, even if some particulates deposit laminate on one of the trapping surfaces of the partition wall of the particulate filter when the exhaust gas flow is reversed, active-oxygen arrives at the deposited particulates and no particulates deposit again on the deposited particulates due to the reversed flow of the exhaust gas and thus the deposited particulates are gradually oxidized and removed and it can be oxidized and removed sufficiently for some period till the next reversal of the exhaust gas. Of course, by alternately using the one trapping surface and the other trapping surface of the partition wall, the amount of trapped particulates on each trapping surface is smaller than that of a particulate filter in which the single trapping surface always traps the particulates. This facilitates oxidizing and removal of the trapped particulates on the trapping surface.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the present flowchart, the valve body is changed over every predetermined running distance. Thus, the valve body is changed over before the deposited particulates can transform into carbonaceous matter that can hardly be oxidized. Further, this can prevent problems in which the large amount of deposited particulates ignites and burns at once to melt the particulate filter by the burned heat thereof and the like. Further, when the valve body is reversed, even if the large amount of particulates has deposited on one of the trapping surfaces of the partition wall of the particulate filter, the deposited particulates are easily smashed into fine pieces by the reversed flow of the exhaust gas. A part of the particulates that cannot be oxidized and removed in the pores in the partition wall is discharged from the particulate filter. However, therefore, it is prevented that the exhaust resistance of the particulate filter increased more to have a bad influence on the operation of the vehicle. Further, the other trapping surface of the partition wall of the particulate filter can newly trap the particulates.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Thus, if the valve body is changed over every predetermined running distance, a large deposition of the particulates on the particulate filter can be prevented. The valve body does not limit to be changed over every predetermined running distance. For example, the valve body may be changed over every predetermined time or may be irregularly changed over.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the present flowchart, utilizing an increase of the difference pressure between the exhaust gas upstream side and the exhaust gas downstream side of the particulate filter in accordance with an amount of particulates deposited on the particulate filter <b>70</b>, when the difference pressure is larger than a predetermined pressure, it is determined that some particulates deposit on the particulate filter and thus the valve body may be changed over. Concretely, an exhaust pressure on the first connecting portion <b>72</b><i>a </i>(referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) is detected by a pressure sensor arranged therein and an exhaust pressure on the second connecting portion <b>72</b><i>b </i>(referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) is detected by another pressure arranged therein, and it is determined if the absolute value of the difference between the two pressures is larger than a predetermined value. Here, the absolute value is used in the determination. Therefore, even if the exhaust gas upstream side is either the first connecting portion <b>72</b><i>a </i>or the second connecting portion <b>72</b><i>b</i>, the increase in the difference pressure can be determined. Strictly speaking, the difference pressure between the both sides of the particulate filter changes in accordance with the pressure of the exhaust gas discharged from the combustion chamber every engine operating condition. Accordingly, in the determination of the deposition of the particulates, it is preferable to specify the engine operating condition.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Other than the difference pressure, in the determination for changing over the valve body, observing the change of electric resistance on a predetermined partition wall of the particulate filter, the fact that the electric resistance decreases along with the deposition of the particulates thereon can be utilized, or the fact that a transmissivity or reflectivity of light on a predetermined partition wall of the particulate filter drops along with the deposition of the particulate thereon can be utilized. Thus, if the valve body is changed over by the direct determination of the deposition of the particulates, it will certainly prevent the engine output dropping considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Besides, to prevent the large deposition of the particulates, if the valve body is set from one shut-off position to the middle position in the recovery process of the SO<sub>x </sub>pollution of the catalytic apparatus, the valve body may be set the other shut-off position immediately after the finishing of the recovery process.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The present device for purifying the exhaust gas can reverse the exhaust gas upstream side and the exhaust gas downstream side of the particulate filter by a very simple structure. Further, the particulate filter requires a large opening area to facilitate the introduction of the exhaust gas. In the device, the particulate filter having a large opening area can be used without making it difficult to mount it on the vehicle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, when the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere of the particulate filter is made rich, i.e., when the oxygen concentration therein is decreased, active-oxygen O is released at once time from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> to the outside. Therefore, the deposited particulates become these that are easily oxidized by the large amount of active-oxygen released at one time, and can be oxidized and removed thereby without a luminous flame.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">On the other hand, when the air-fuel ratio is maintained lean in the surrounding atmosphere of the particulate filter, the surface of platinum Pt is covered with oxygen, that is, oxygen contamination is caused. When such oxygen contamination is caused, the oxidization action to NO<sub>x </sub>of platinum Pt drops and thus the absorbing efficiency of NO<sub>x </sub>drops. Therefore, the amount of active-oxygen released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> decreases. However, when the air-fuel ratio is made rich, oxygen on the surface of Platinum Pt is consumed and thus the oxygen contamination is cancelled. Accordingly, when the air-fuel ratio is changed over from rich to lean again, the oxidization action to NO<sub>x </sub>becomes strong and thus the absorbing efficiency rises. Therefore, the amount of active-oxygen released from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Thus, when the air-fuel ratio is maintained lean, if the air-fuel ratio is changed over from lean to rich once in a while, the oxygen contamination of platinum Pt is cancelled every this time and thus the amount of released active-oxygen increases when the air-fuel ratio is lean. Therefore, the oxidization action of the particulates on the particulate filter <b>70</b> can be promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, the cancellation of the oxygen contamination causes the reducing agent to burn and thus the burned heat thereof raises the temperature of the particulate filter. Therefore, in the particulate filter, the amount of particulates that can be oxidized and removed increases and thus the deposited particulates are oxidized and removed more easily. If the air-fuel ratio is made rich immediately after the upstream side and the downstream side of the particulate filter is reversed by the valve body <b>71</b><i>a</i>, the other trapping surface on which the particulates do not remain or deposit can release the large amount of active-oxygen. Thus, the large amount of released active-oxygen can oxidize and remove the deposited particulates more certainly. Of course, regardless of the reversal of the valve body <b>71</b><i>a</i>, the air-fuel ratio may be made rich once in a while. Therefore, the particulates hardly deposit on the particulate filter.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As a method to make the air-fuel ratio rich, for example, the above-mentioned low temperature combustion may be carried out. Of course, when changing over from the normal combustion to the low temperature combustion or before this, the exhaust gas upstream side and the exhaust gas downstream side of the particulate filter may be reversed. Further, to make the air-fuel ratio of the surrounding atmosphere rich, the combustion air-fuel ratio may be merely made rich. Further, in addition to the main fuel injection in the compression stroke, the fuel injector may inject fuel into the cylinder in the exhaust stroke or the expansion stroke (post-injection) or may injected fuel into the cylinder in the intake stroke (pre-injection). Of course, an interval between the post-injection or the pre-injection and the main fuel injection may not be provided. Further, fuel may be supplied to the exhaust system. Besides, in the catalytic apparatus and the particulate filter, the air-fuel ratio in the surrounding atmosphere must be at least temporarily made rich to release NO<sub>x </sub>from the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent carried thereon. It is preferable to carry out the air-fuel ratio rich control immediately after the reversing of the upstream side and the downstream side of the particulate filter.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">By the way, when SO<sub>3 </sub>exists, calcium Ca in the exhaust gas forms calcium sulfate CaSO<sub>4</sub>. Calcium sulfate CaSO<sub>4 </sub>is hardly oxidized and remains on the particulate filter as ash. To prevent of blocking the meshes of the particulate filter caused by calcium sulfate CaSO<sub>4</sub>, an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal having an ionization tendency stronger than that of calcium Ca, such as potassium K may be used as the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b>. Therefore, SO<sub>3 </sub>diffused in the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b> is combined with potassium K to form potassium sulfate K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and thus calcium Ca is not combined with SO<sub>3 </sub>but passes through the partition walls of the particulate filter. Accordingly, the meshes of the particulate filter are not blocked by the ash. Thus, it is desired to use, as the NO<sub>x </sub>absorbent <b>61</b>, an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal having an ionization tendency stronger than calcium Ca, such as potassium K, lithium Li, cesium Cs, rubidium Rb, barium Ba or strontium Sr.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the above-mentioned embodiment, the particulate filter <b>70</b> carries the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x</sub>. However, in another embodiment, the particulate filter may carry cerium Ce. Cerium Ce absorbs oxygen when the oxygen concentration in the surrounding atmosphere is high (Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>→2CeO<sub>2</sub>) and releases oxygen when the oxygen concentration decreases (2CeO<sub>2</sub>→CeO<sub>3</sub>). Thus, cerium Ce functions an oxygen absorbing agent. Iron Fe or tin Sn can be used as the oxygen absorbing agent. In the present embodiment, the particulate filter does not carry the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x</sub>. However, the catalytic apparatus is arranged upstream the particulate filter, the catalytic apparatus can carry a large amount of catalyst for purifying NO<sub>x</sub>, the catalysts do not become covered with the particulates due to the structure of the catalytic apparatus, and thus the catalytic apparatus can purify sufficiently NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas. In the present embodiment, the trapped particulates on the particulate filter ignite and burn with producing luminous flame at a high temperature. At this time, the catalyst for absorbing and reducing NO<sub>x </sub>is not carried on the particulate filter and thus the catalyst does not deteriorate. Further, when the air-fuel ratio in the exhaust gas is made rich to, for example, regenerate the catalytic apparatus, a part of unburned fuel (HC) included in the exhaust gas is not oxidized on the catalytic apparatus and can flow into the particulate filter. The unburned fuel has an adhesion property as same as the above-mentioned SOF and adheres the particulates each other on the particulate filter, and thus makes the particulates become a large mass. In the present embodiment, when the air-fuel ratio in the exhaust gas is rich, i.e., the oxygen concentration is low, cerium Ce releases oxygen as mentioned above and thus the released oxygen oxidizes the unburned fuel on the particulate filter. Therefore, a large mass of the particulates is not formed and thus the filter meshes is not blocked thereby. The oxygen absorbing as cerium Ce agent functions as an oxidation catalyst. In the present embodiment, if the particulate filter also carries a noble metal catalyst as platinum Pt, the unburned fuel can be oxidized more favorably. SO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust gas adheres the oxygen absorbing agent on the particulate filter and the oxygen absorbing function thereof drops. However, in the present embodiment, the catalytic apparatus arranged upstream the particulate filter can treat SO<sub>x </sub>as mentioned above and thus SO<sub>x </sub>does not adhere the oxygen absorbing agent on the particulate filter. In the present embodiment, a noble metal such as platinum Pt can release active-oxygen from the held NO<sub>2 </sub>and SO<sub>3 </sub>on the surface thereof. The released active-oxygen can oxidize the particulates on the particulate filter. Further, oxygen released from the oxygen absorbing agent such as cerium Ce, iron Fe or tin Sn is also active-oxygen and thus the released active-oxygen can oxidize the particulates on the particulate filter. Thus, at least part of the trapped particulates is oxidized and removed and thus the particulates deposits hardly on the particulate filter of the present embodiment. In the above two embodiments, the catalytic apparatus functions to make uniform the temperature distribution in the exhaust gas before the exhaust gas flows into the particulate filter. Thus, it is prevented that only a part of the particulate filter reaches a low temperature. Accordingly, the trapped particulates are generally oxidized or burned and thus it is prevented that the particulates deposits on only the part of the particulate filter and the deposited particulates transform into carbonaceous matter that can hardly be oxidized or burned.</p>
