<br/>
(hereinafter to be also referred to as epoxytriazole derivative (VI)) is a useful synthetic intermediate for anti-fungal agents, such as triazole compounds described in JP-A-4-356471, U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,861 and the like.
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The production methods of epoxytriazole derivative (VI) have been reported in, for example, Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn), Vol. 67, 1427-1433 (1994), The Chemical Society of Japan, May 1994, vol. 67, No. 5, pp. 1427-1433, Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin (Chem. Pharm. Bull.), Vol. 43(3), 432-440 (1995), Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, vol. 43, No. 3, pp. 432-440 (1995) and the like. According to these methods, as shown in the following reaction schemes, epoxidation of a compound of the formula (VII) (hereinafter to be also referred to as compound (VII)) wherein hydroxyl group is protected by a protecting group, such as tetrahydropyranyl group and the like, is conducted using trimethyloxosulfonium halide.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003">
<img id="EMI-C00003" he="216.75mm" wi="75.86mm" file="US07297802-20071120-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The compound (VII) used as a starting material in conventional methods can be produced by protecting hydroxyl group of a compound, wherein tetrahydropyranyl group of the formula (VII) has been substituted by hydroxyl group (to be also referred to as a deprotected compound of compound (VII)), with tetrahydropyranyl group. However, the introduction of a protecting group is uneconomical because it requires an equimolar amount of tetrahydropyranyl derivative relative to the deprotected compound of compound (VII), and the like. In addition, the introduction of protecting group necessitates a deprotection step, thus increasing the number of steps and the like. Moreover, the introduction of protecting group leads to inefficiency. Thus, this method is industrially disadvantageous. According to conventional methods, moreover, stereoisomers, which are in a diastereomeric relationship and resist use thereof as an intermediate for a triazole compound, which is an anti-fungal agent, are by-produced in about 20%. The α-hydroxy-ketone derivative, which is a deprotected compound of compound (VII), is chemically unstable, and the above-mentioned epoxidation without protection of hydroxyl group has been considered to be difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for economically and efficiently producing epoxytriazole derivative (V) to be mentioned below, such as epoxytriazole derivative (VI) and the like, or an intermediate therefor, with high quality by an industrial means.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">As a result of the intensive studies done by the present inventors, they have found that the above-mentioned epoxidation unexpectedly proceeds even without protecting the deprotected compound of compound (VII), which has been expected to be difficult. Furthermore, they have found that diastereoselectivity can be dramatically improved, which resulted in the completion of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention provides the following.

<p id="p-0037" num="0050">The compound (II) can be obtained by, for example, reacting compound (I) with trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt in a solvent in the presence of a base. The order of addition of the reagents is not particularly limited, and, for example, trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt and a base may be added to a solvent and then compound (I) may be added; or a solution of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt may be added to a solvent and then a base may be added thereto to allow reaction and the obtained solution may be added to a solution of compound (I) in a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0051">The base to be used in Step A is not particularly limited as long as it reacts with trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to give sulfur ylide.

When the amount of the base to be used in Step A is less than 0.25 mol relative to 1 mol of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt, trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt remains more than necessary, which is economically disadvantageous, and unpreferably causes side reaction. When the amount of the base to be used exceeds 1.1 mol relative to 1 mol of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt, a base unreacted with trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt remains in excess, which is economically disadvantageous and causes a side reaction (mostly isomerization) to possibly degrade the yield and quality.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0053">The amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used in Step A is generally 0.8 mol-5.0 mol, preferably 1.0 mol-3.0 mol, more preferably 1.1 mol-2.5 mol, relative to 1 mol of compound (I). When the amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used in Step A is less than 0.8 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (I), compound (I) partly remains unreacted to possibly lower the yield.

<p id="p-0044" num="0057">The compound (II) to be obtained in Step A can be isolated and purified by a conventional method. For example, the reaction mixture is poured into water and partitioned, the organic layer is washed and filtrated, and the obtained filtrate is washed, dried and concentrated under reduced pressure to isolate compound (II).
