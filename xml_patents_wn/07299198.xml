<heading id="h-0001" level="1">I. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a method for returning merchandise from an original buyer to a retailer for secondary resale by a returns facilitator. More particularly, it relates to a method for reselling returned merchandise, which returned merchandise is indirectly shipped from an original buyer to secondary purchaser of the returned merchandise.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When an original buyer returns merchandise to particularly a mail-order or online retailer, the original buyer typically must first ship the merchandise back to the retailer (typically with the original buyer paying for the shipping cost), which retailer may or may not directly resell the merchandise. This decision of the retailer to resell the merchandise may be contingent upon the condition of the returned merchandise and whether it was returned in its original packaging and with all of its original enclosure materials. Further contingencies may include whether the returned merchandise is currently being sold by the retailer and/or whether the retailer has ample inventory space for the returned merchandise. In recent studies by third party logistics providers, approximately 60-80% of all returned merchandise is in condition for resale by the original merchant.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the event the retailer does not resell the returned merchandise, the retailer typically out sources the processing of returned merchandise to a third party logistics provider. This outsourcing step once again involves the shipping of the returned merchandise, wherein this time the returned merchandise is shipped from the retailer to the third party logistics provider for secondary resale by the third party logistics provider. Afterwards, the third party logistics provider preferably inspects the returned merchandise, and then depending upon the condition of the returned merchandise, ships the returned merchandise back to the manufacturer, retailer or to a secondary retailer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, the above-described process is inefficient as it suffers from several drawbacks. For instance, this process is time consuming as it may involve several shipping routes, with each route necessitating handling and shipping costs. Another drawback is the inclusion of a third party logistics provider, which has its own additional cost and delays associated with it.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for reselling returned merchandise that overcomes the above-noted inefficient drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to a method for secondary resale of returned merchandise wherein the returned merchandise is preferably shipped from an original consumer to a secondary consumer, after the returned merchandise is rerouted via a shipping carrier. In other words, the returned merchandise is indirectly shipped from the original consumer to a secondary consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention includes the steps of providing an original consumer having merchandise to be returned, which original consumer communicates with a returns facilitator indicating the original consumer's desire to return merchandise. Preferably, the original consumer provides the returns facilitator with information describing the merchandise to be returned. The returns facilitator then provides the original consumer with shipping information regarding the merchandise to be returned. Preferably, this shipping information includes a shipping address associated with either the returns facilitator or the original merchant from which the merchandise was originally purchased. The original consumer then provides the merchandise to be returned to a shipping carrier so as to be shipped to the aforesaid address provided by the returns facilitator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Concurrently with the original consumers aforesaid actions, the returns facilitator offers for sale the returned merchandise to a secondary buyer preferably via the internet, telephony or mail. If a secondary buyer is found either prior to, or during the shipping of the returned merchandise, the returns facilitator communicates with the shipping carrier so as to reroute the returned merchandise to an address preferably associated with the secondary buyer.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">V. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is shown a flow diagram, illustrated generally by reference numeral <b>10</b>, depicting the present invention in which an original buyer <b>12</b> first purchases merchandise <b>16</b> from an original vendor <b>14</b> (step <b>100</b>) with the vendor <b>14</b> thereafter shipping the purchased merchandise <b>16</b> to the buyer <b>12</b> (step <b>102</b>). In accordance with the present invention, this sale is typically performed remotely wherein the vendor <b>14</b> is either a mail order vendor or conducts business via the internet (e.g., Amazon.com). The present invention is of course not to be limited to such remote sales but may encompass the situation wherein a buyer physically purchases an item from a retailer (e.g., buyer visits a Sears retail location and purchase merchandise).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the event the original buyer <b>12</b> decides to return the merchandise <b>16</b> (step <b>104</b>), the original buyer <b>12</b> contacts a returns facilitator <b>18</b> associated with the original vendor <b>14</b> (step <b>106</b>), which returns facilitator <b>18</b> is operative to process the returning of the merchandise <b>16</b> purchased from the original vendor <b>14</b>. Preferably, the original buyer <b>12</b> provides information describing and/or identifying the merchandise <b>16</b> (e.g., product description, invoice number, skew number, etc.) and contacts the returns facilitator <b>18</b> via any known means of communication including the intranet, telephony (including facsimile), email and mail.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is to be appreciated that the returns facilitator <b>18</b> may be either integrated “inhouse” with the original vendor <b>14</b> or may be a third party relative to the original vendor <b>14</b>. In the event the returns facilitator <b>18</b> is a third party relative to the original vendor <b>14</b>, it is to be further appreciated that the returns facilitator <b>18</b> preferably has similar secondary retail arrangements with a plurality of other vendors.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Afterwards, the returns facilitator <b>18</b> makes available for sale the returned merchandise <b>16</b> which can be achieved through any known means of advertising or communication (e.g., email, telemarketing, mail, newspaper or periodical advertisements) (step <b>108</b>). Preferably, in accordance with the present invention, such a secondary sale of the aforesaid original merchandise <b>16</b> is accomplished by the returns facilitator <b>18</b> via a web page(s) on the internet in which the returns facilitator <b>18</b> maintains a web site for listing the secondary sale of the aforesaid returned merchandise <b>16</b>. A secondary buyer <b>20</b> then is able to view the items for secondary sale by the returns facilitator <b>18</b> (e.g., preferably via the internet) and choose which merchandise to be returned item to purchase. It is to be appreciated that in accordance with the present invention a secondary buyer <b>20</b> may consist of an individual buyer or another retailer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is also to be understood that secondary buyers <b>20</b> may subscribe to the returns facilitator <b>18</b> whereby the secondary buyer <b>20</b> creates a “wish list” of items desired by the secondary buyer <b>20</b>, which wish list is provided to the returns facilitator <b>18</b> and contains a description of desired items. The returns facilitator <b>18</b> then queries each buyer's wish list to determine if there is a match between the aforesaid returned merchandise items currently offered for sale by the returns facilitator <b>18</b> and the items contained in the wish lists provided to the returns facilitator <b>18</b> by subscribing secondary buyers <b>20</b>. If a match is determined by the returns facilitator <b>18</b>, a message is then preferably provided to the secondary buyer <b>20</b> indicating such a potential match, afterwhich the secondary buyer <b>20</b> decides whether or not to purchase the returned merchandise item <b>16</b>. For example, a secondary buyer <b>20</b> may create a wish list consisting of: 1) a laptop computer that is less than 7 lbs and has between 128-256 MB of RAM available; and 2) a desktop computer that has a processing speed greater than 2 GHz and has at least 512 MB of RAM. Afterwhich, returned merchandise <b>16</b>, among other items, consists of a 1) laptop that is 5.2 lbs with 128 MB of RAM; and 2) a desktop having a processing speed 1.3 GHz with 512 MB of RAM is provided for secondary resale by returns facilitator <b>18</b>. The returns facilitator <b>18</b> may then determine a match exists between the aforesaid laptops (and not the desktops) and informs the subscribing secondary buyer <b>20</b> (preferably via email) of the aforesaid laptop match. The secondary buyer <b>20</b> may then further investigate the laptop offered for sale to decide whether or not to purchase it.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the event a secondary buyer <b>20</b> desires to purchase the returned merchandise item <b>16</b> from the reselling facilitator <b>18</b>, the secondary buyer <b>20</b> preferably agrees to the terms and conditions for the secondary resale, which transaction is preferably performed electronically (e.g., via the internet, e-mail or telephony)(step <b>110</b>). As part of this sale, the secondary buyer <b>20</b> preferably provides shipping and payment instructions for the purchased returned merchandise <b>16</b>. It is to be appreciated that payment can be effected in a number of known methods including check, credit card or third party payment systems, such as Paypal™.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The returns facilitator <b>18</b> then provides shipping instructions to the original buyer <b>12</b> (step <b>112</b>). As will be explained in more detail below, the shipping instructions may consist of a shipping address. An electronic label, or a pre-printed shipping label which simply needs to be affixed to the merchandise <b>16</b>. Once the original buyer <b>12</b> has received the shipping instructions, the original buyer <b>12</b> then ships the merchandise <b>16</b>, via the carrier system <b>24</b> (as will be explained in more detail below), and in accordance with the aforesaid shipping instructions (step <b>114</b>). The carrier system <b>24</b> then delivers the merchandise and confirms receipt <b>16</b> to the secondary buyer <b>20</b> (step <b>116</b>). Once the secondary buyer <b>20</b> receives the merchandise <b>16</b> from the shipping system <b>24</b> (step <b>118</b>), the secondary buyer <b>20</b> preferably inspects the merchandise <b>16</b> such that the returns facilitator <b>18</b> can then authorize the original vendor <b>14</b> to provide the appropriate refund to the original buyer <b>12</b> for the returned merchandise <b>16</b> (step <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method for shipping the returned merchandise from the original buyer <b>12</b> to the secondary buyer <b>20</b>, via carrier system <b>24</b>, will now be described. Once the secondary buyer <b>20</b> purchases the returned merchandise <b>16</b> from the returns facilitator <b>18</b> (step <b>200</b>), the returns facilitator <b>18</b> provides a first shipping address to the original buyer <b>12</b> who affixes this first shipping address to the merchandise <b>16</b> and ships it (step <b>202</b>). It is noted that this first shipping address is not the shipping address given by the secondary buyer <b>20</b> but rather is a “default address” (any address other than the secondary buyer's given address). Preferably, the default address is an address associated with the original vendor <b>14</b>, such that the original buyer <b>12</b> believes the merchandise <b>16</b> is being returned to the original vendor <b>14</b> thus preventing abusive usage of the services of the returns facilitator <b>18</b>. The carrier system <b>24</b> that is chosen to deliver the returned merchandise <b>16</b> (e.g., U.S.P.S., FedEx, UPS, etc.) is then provided with a rerouting address to be associate with or replace the default address, which rerouting address is the secondary buyer's <b>20</b> given shipping address (step <b>204</b>). The shipping carriers <b>24</b> routing database is then update with the aforesaid rerouting address (step <b>206</b>). It is noted that the aforesaid rerouting information can be encoded in a bar code, planetcode bar code, zip code, or other form of encoding information.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hence, after the merchandise <b>16</b> having default address label is received by the carrier system <b>24</b> having the default address, the carrier system <b>24</b> scans the default address label (step <b>208</b>) and determines if there is a rerouting address associated with the default address (step <b>210</b>). If no, the merchandise is delivered to the default address (step <b>212</b>). If yes, the merchandise <b>16</b> is relabeled by the carrier system <b>24</b> with the aforesaid rerouting address (step <b>214</b>) and is thereafter delivered to the secondary buyer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is to be understood that in accordance with the present invention, the returned merchandise <b>16</b> may be shipped from the original buyer <b>12</b> to the default address either 1) already having a secondary buyer <b>20</b> associated with it, or 2) not having a secondary buyer associated with the merchandise <b>16</b> while it is in the carrier system <b>24</b>. That is, and with respect to already having a secondary buyer <b>20</b>, it has been predetermined that the merchandise <b>16</b> is to be rerouted by the carrier system <b>24</b> to arrive at the secondary buyer's given address.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">And with respect to not having a secondary buyer <b>20</b>, the original buyer <b>12</b>, after contacting the returns facilitator <b>18</b>, sends the package to a default address that is preferably an address associated with the original vendor <b>14</b>, and while the merchandise <b>16</b> is in the possession of the carrier system <b>24</b>, the returns facilitator <b>18</b> proceeds to find a secondary buyer for the merchandise <b>16</b>. If a secondary buyer <b>20</b> is found, the carriers <b>24</b> routing database is updated with the secondary buyer's given address so as to facilitate delivery of merchandise <b>16</b> by the carrier system <b>24</b> to secondary buyer <b>20</b>. It is noted that this enables the returns facilitator <b>18</b> to use the carrier system <b>24</b> for the returned merchandise <b>16</b> as a virtual short term warehouse, whereby the additional shipping costs that will be incurred while the returned merchandise is being processed in the carrier system <b>24</b> is still less than that which would be incurred if the original vendor had to first accept delivery of returned merchandise, store the returned merchandise in inventory, and then reship the returned merchandise to a secondary buyer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">And if the returns facilitator <b>18</b> does not find a secondary buyer <b>20</b>, the carrier system <b>24</b> simply proceeds to deliver the merchandise to the default address, which is preferably the address of the original vendor <b>14</b>. It is further noted that rerouting of the merchandise <b>16</b> can occur at lease two points in the carrier's <b>24</b> system, namely the point of acceptance for the merchandise <b>16</b> or at the destination delivery location of the carrier system <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, the present invention is advantageous in that it eliminates unnecessary shipping of the returned merchandise and the need for costly and inefficient third party logistics processes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In summary, a method for reselling returned merchandise has been described. Although the present invention has been described with emphasis on a particular embodiment, it should be understood that many changes and modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed. For example, many modifications and adaptations to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that some aspects of the present invention will be used to advantage without the corresponding use of other aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Accordingly, the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment should be considered as merely illustrative of the present invention and not in limitation thereof.</p>
