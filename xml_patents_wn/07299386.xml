<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates generally to the testing of digital signal processing units and, more particularly, to the detection of trigger events in a target processor that result in the generation of a trigger signals. The trigger events are related to the program execution and information related to these events is used by the host processing unit to analyze the operation of the target processor by the host processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As microprocessors and digital signal processors have become increasingly complex, advanced techniques have been developed to test these devices. Dedicated apparatus is available to implement the advanced techniques. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a general configuration for the test and debug of a target processor <b>12</b> is shown. The test and debug procedures operate under control of a host processing unit <b>10</b>. The host processing unit <b>10</b> applies control signals to the emulation unit <b>11</b> and receives (test) data signals from the emulation unit <b>11</b> by cable connector <b>14</b>. The emulation unit <b>11</b> applies control signals to and receives (test) signals from the target processor <b>12</b> by connector cable <b>15</b>. The emulation unit <b>11</b> can be thought of as an interface unit between the host processing unit <b>10</b> and the target processor <b>12</b>. The emulation unit <b>11</b> must process the control signals from the host processor unit <b>10</b> and apply these signals to the target processor <b>12</b> in such a manner that the target processor will respond with the appropriate test signals. The test signals from the target processor <b>12</b> can be a variety types. Two of the most popular test signal types are the JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) signals and trace signals. The JTAG signal provides a standardized test procedure in wide use. Trace signals are signals from a multiplicity of junctions in the target processor <b>12</b>. While the width of the bus interfacing to the host processing unit <b>10</b> generally have a standardized width, the bus between the emulation unit <b>11</b> and the target processor <b>12</b> can be increased to accommodate the increasing complexity of the target processing unit <b>12</b>. Thus, part of the interface function between the host processing unit <b>10</b> and the target processor <b>12</b> is to store the test signals until the signals can be transmitted to the host processing unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the operation of the trigger generation unit <b>19</b> is shown. At least one event signal is applied to the trigger generation unit <b>19</b>. Based on the event signals applied to the trigger generation unit <b>19</b>, a trigger signal is selected. Certain events and combination of events, referred to as an event front, generate a selected trigger signal that results in certain activity in the target processor such as a debug halt. Combinations of different events generating trigger signals are referred to as jobs. Multiple jobs can have the same trigger signal or combination of trigger signals. In the test and debug of the target processor, the trigger signals can provide impetus for changing state in the target processor or for performing a specified activity. The event front defines the reason for the generation of trigger signal. This information is important in understanding the operation of the target processor because, as pointed out above, several combinations of events can result in the generation of a trigger signal. In order to analyze the operation of the target processing unit, the portion of the code resulting in the trigger signal must be identified. However, the events in the host processor leading to the generation of event signals can be complicated. Specifically, the characteristics of an instruction at a program counter address can determine whether a trigger signal should be generated. A trigger signal can indicate when an address is within a range of addresses, outside of a range of addresses, some combination of address characteristics, and/or the address is aligned with a reference address. In this instance, the address can be the program address of an instruction or a memory address directly or indirectly referenced by a program instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A need has been felt for apparatus and an associated method having the feature that events corresponding to characteristics of the program counter address can be identified. It would be yet another feature of the apparatus and associated method to provide for the identification of program counter address characteristics that encompasses more than one range. It would be a still further feature of the present invention to identify program address characteristics that include the characteristics of the data identified by the program counter address. It would be still another feature of the apparatus and associated method to identify characteristics of addresses referenced by program instruction. It would be yet a further feature of the present invention to compare characteristics of two addresses.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The aforementioned and other features are accomplished, according to the present invention, by providing a comparator that can determine the relationship of either one or two addresses to a group of user selected characteristics. In particular, the comparator includes a first comparator unit and second comparator unit. In this manner, characteristics for one or for two addresses can be determined, i.e., whether two addresses meet relatively simple, and possible different requirements or a single address meets more complex requirements. In addition, the comparator can include apparatus responsive to requirements for a related data field for adding these data requirements to a decision requiring the address. Finally, a decision unit determines whether all the criteria for the address have been met and, when the criteria has been met, an event signal is generated. The event signal either alone or in combination with other event signals can result in a trigger signal. The trigger signal changes the operation of the target processor and event signal or signals resulting in a trigger signal are communicated to the host processing unit.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">1. Detailed Description of the Figures</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has been described with respect to the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of the apparatus for capturing the identification of the events resulting in a trigger signal is shown. A plurality of target processing unit and test and debug components can provide an event signal under preselected conditions. The components generating event signals include a state machine <b>210</b> (determining the state in which the target processing unit is executing code), counter zero units <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> (determining when a preselected condition has been met), an auxiliary event generating unit <b>213</b> (providing an event signal for a predetermined condition of the target processor), and comparators <b>214</b>-<b>217</b> (for processing signals from a system bus). Each of the components providing event signals are coupled to a particular input terminal of trigger generation unit <b>19</b> and to an associated location in a capture register <b>22</b>. When an event signal or preselected combination of event signals is identified by the trigger generation unit <b>19</b>, an appropriate trigger signal is generated. Along with the trigger signal, the trigger generation unit <b>19</b> generates a control signal. The control signal results in the storage of the applied event signals in the capture register <b>22</b>. The contents of the capture register <b>22</b> can be applied to a read bus <b>23</b> and subsequently transferred to the host processing unit for analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a block diagram of the apparatus for storing the contents of the program counter related to the generation of a trigger signal is shown. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the state machine <b>210</b>, the counter zero units <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>, the auxiliary event generator <b>213</b>, and the comparators, <b>214</b>-<b>217</b>, in the presence of preselected conditions, generate event signals that are applied to the trigger generation unit <b>19</b>. In response to a preselected event signal or combination of event signals, the trigger generation unit <b>19</b> generates a trigger signal. The trigger signal causes a predetermined response by the target processor. In addition, the trigger generation unit <b>19</b> provides a trigger control signal. This trigger control signal is applied to register <b>32</b>. The contents of program counter are applied through a delay line <b>35</b> to the register <b>32</b>. In response to the trigger control signal, the program counter contents are stored in the register <b>32</b>. In response to a control signal, the contents of register <b>32</b> can be transferred to the host processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the over all structure of a comparator unit <b>40</b>, according to the present invention, is shown. The comparator unit <b>40</b> includes a comparator one <b>41</b> and a comparator two <b>42</b>. Comparator one <b>41</b> receives input signals from bus A and from data qualifying network <b>49</b>. Comparator two <b>42</b> receives input signals from bus B and from the data qualifying network <b>49</b>. Comparator one <b>41</b> generates an INTERCOMPARATOR ONE signal and applies this signal to comparator two <b>42</b>. The comparator two <b>42</b> generates an INTERCOMPARATOR TWO signal and applies this signal to comparator one <b>41</b>. Comparator one <b>41</b> provides an EVENT ONE output signal, while comparator two <b>42</b> provides an EVENT TWO output signal. The data qualifying network <b>49</b> is used to ensure that an event signal is generated when the address(es) being tested by the comparators <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> meet the requirements and the data accessed at the address has predetermined relationship, for example with a reference data value. While in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> one data qualifying network <b>49</b> is shown, a data qualifying network can be associated with each comparator <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, components of the comparator one <b>41</b> are shown. Comparator one <b>41</b> includes a qualification logic <b>411</b>. The data qualifying logic <b>411</b> receives a signal from the data qualifying network <b>49</b> and applies a signal to comparator logic <b>412</b>. The comparator logic <b>412</b> has the bus A signals applied thereto. The comparator logic <b>412</b> applies a signal to the event signal generation unit <b>413</b> and generates the COMPARATOR ONE signal. The event signal generation unit <b>413</b> receives the INTERCOMPARTOR TWO signal and generates the EVENT ONE signal. The comparator logic <b>412</b> and qualification logic unit <b>411</b> also receive control signals. The control signals can include the parameters used in the comparator logic <b>412</b>. The qualification logic <b>411</b> receives architecture-related signals such as whether a valid memory access was generated, whether the memory access was a read or write operation. These control signals can determine whether an operation of the processor meets preselected criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</figref>, the operations of the comparator unit for some exemplary conditions are illustrated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, an example of the operation of the comparator unit using only comparator one (or comparator two) is shown. In this example, the comparator provides an event signal when any portion of the address signal group is less that the designated address (shown by the arrow). The exemplary address signal groups are shown as word signal groups. Only the address with the no portion of the addressed signal group being less than the designated address provides no EVENT signal. (This criterion is one definition of a โtouchingโ requirement). Thus, signal group <b>1</b> generates an event signal, a portion being less than the designated address. Signal group <b>2</b> also generates an event signal, the entire signal group being less than the designated address. Signal group <b>3</b> is entirely above the designated address and therefore does not meet the โless thanโ requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows another type of event generation. In this example, the same touching criterion is used. In addition, the address signal group must be match-aligned with a reference address. The reference address is word signal group and the word signal group alignment addresses (WB) are also shown. This criterion is referred to as an โexactโ criterion. In this example, event signal <b>1</b> does not generate an event signal because, although the touching requirement is met, the word group is not aligned with the reference address. No event signal is generated for signal group <b>2</b> because, although the โexact requirement is met, the touching requirement is not met. An event signal is generated for signal group <b>3</b> because the signal group is aligned with the reference signal group and the touching requirement is met. For signal group <b>4</b>, an event signal is not generated because although the touching requirement is met, the exact (alignment) requirement is not met. With respect to signal group <b>5</b>, a single byte is shown as not generating an event signal. This result arises from the fact that, although the touching requirement is met, the reference signal group is a word. The signal group <b>5</b> is not aligned with a word boundary defined by the reference signal group.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, only one of the two comparators is required to generate and event signal for the exemplary requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, an example is given wherein both comparator one and comparator two are needed to generate an EVENT signal. In this example, a portion of the address must in a region defined by being less than a designated address #1 or being greater than a designated address #2. Because of these two criteria, one criterion must be tested by each comparator. Signal group <b>1</b> results in the generation of an event signal because it is at least partially in the region defined by designated address #1 thereby fulfilling a touching requirement. Similarly, signal group <b>2</b> is at least partially in region defined by designated address #2 and thereby also meets the touching requirement. Signal group <b>3</b> does not meet either touching requirement and therefore no event signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">2. Operation of the Preferred Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The operation of the comparator unit of the present invention can be understood as follows. The data qualifying unit <b>49</b> determines when the data associated with the address(es) to be analyzed has the required characteristics. The data qualifying logic <b>411</b> then provides a signal that determines whether the analysis of the address in the comparator logic can continue. When the process can continue, the comparator logic determines one selected characteristic of the address applied by the bus. The selected characteristic is determined by the control signals that are typically selected by the user for the currently executing program. The selected characteristic is the relationship of the address signal group to a designated or reference address. When the selected characteristic is present, then a signal is applied to the event signal generation unit. As a result of this signal, an EVENT signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the foregoing example determines the relationship of an address signal group to a single designated, reference address, the fact that the two comparators are interconnected permits the comparator unit <b>40</b> to determine the relationship of an address signal group to two designated, reference addresses, i.e., one reference address in each comparator. In other words, the use of both comparators permits the comparator unit to determine the relationship of an address signal group to a region of addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The comparator of the present invention is particularly useful in the test and debug procedures of a target processor. In analyzing the operation of target processing system, it is important to know the events that result in the change in operation produced by a trigger signal. The present invention captures an identification of the events that result in the change in operation, e.g., the transition to an interrupt service routine. These events are captured only in the event that an actual trigger signal is generated. Upon the generation of a trigger signal, signals specifying the events causing the trigger signal are stored and can be transferred to the host processing unit for analysis. In addition, it is necessary to determine where in the program execution the trigger signal occurred as well as the events that resulted in the generation of the trigger signal. The contents of the program counter are the best indication of the state of program execution at the time of the trigger signal. However, because of the pipeline delay (and, if present, a pipeline flattener delay), the events that result in the generation of the trigger signal are the result of instructions that began execution before the delay. Consequently, in order to correlate the events causing the trigger signal with the appropriate instruction identified by the program counter, a delay is added in the instruction applied to the register. In this manner, the target processor events resulting in the generation of a trigger signal and the related position in the instruction execution can be identified and transferred to the host processing unit for analysis. In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, bus A and bus B are both coupled to the addresses referenced by the program counter. The comparator unit is then used to generate an EVENT signal that is applied to the trigger unit. However, the comparator of the present invention has wider application. For example, two addresses can be applied to the comparator on the two buses and analyzed separately.</p>
