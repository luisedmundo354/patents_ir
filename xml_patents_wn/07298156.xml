<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A holding side contact arm (<b>317</b>) for holding an IC to be tested is positioned on the optical axis (OP) of an alignment CCD camera (<b>326</b>) of an alignment device (<b>320</b>), the IC to be tested is inserted to a first opening (<b>321</b><i>a</i>) formed on an alignment movable portion (<b>321</b>), and a contact member (<b>317</b><i>d</i>) of the holding side contact arm (<b>317</b>) is brought to contact the alignment movable portion (<b>321</b>). Then, an alignment amount for correcting a position of the IC to be tested is calculated by taking an image by the camera (<b>326</b>) and performing image processing. A lock-and-free means (<b>318</b>) provided to a first contact arm (<b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>1</sub>) is made to be in a non-restricted state, a movable portion driving device (<b>322</b>) is driven based on the alignment amount, and the holding side contact arm (<b>317</b>) contacting the alignment movable portion (<b>321</b>) is moved with respect to a root side contact arm (<b>316</b>), so that alignment of a position of the IC to be tested is performed.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electronic device testing apparatus for testing a semiconductor integrated circuit element and other various electronic devices (hereinafter, also representatively referred to as ICs), and particularly relates to an electronic device testing apparatus wherein erroneous contact is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is a 371 of PCT/JP02/1263 filed on Dec. 4, 2002.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an electronic device testing apparatus called a handler, a large number of ICs to be tested held on a tray are conveyed into the handler, and the respective ICs to be tested are brought to electrically contact a test head for conducting a test by an electronic device testing apparatus body (hereinafter, also referred to as a tester). When the test is finished, the ICs are taken out from the test head and reloaded to trays in accordance with the test results so as to be classified to categories of good ones and defective ones, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional handler, a contact arm for bringing an electronic device to be tested to contact a contact portion of a test head is provided with a plurality of actuators. Alignment of the electronic device to be tested with the contact portion is performed by controlling the actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a contact arm configured as above has a relatively heavy weight and it is hard to move at a high speed. This disadvantage becomes particularly noticeable when the number of contact arms increases along with an increase of a simultaneously measured amount.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, if the alignment of the electronic device with the contact portion is not performed appropriately, a significant problem of erroneous contact occurs between the electronic device and the contact portion.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an electronic device testing apparatus for accurately and surely performing alignment of an electronic device to be tested with a contact portion, reducing frequency of erroneous contact, and enabling to move a contact arm for holding and conveying the electronic device at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To attain the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided an electronic device testing apparatus comprising a first contact arm for holding the electronic device to be tested and bringing the electronic device to be tested to contact a contact portion of a test head, and a moving means provided on a base side for moving said first contact arm, including: a first image pickup means for taking an image of the electronic device to be tested in a state of being held by said first contact arm; an image processing means for recognizing a relative position of the electronic device to be tested held by said first contact arm with respect to said contact portion based on image information taken by said first image pickup means; and a contact arm position correction means for correcting the position of said first contact arm holding said electronic device to be tested based on the relative position of the electronic device to be tested with respect to said contact portion recognized by said image processing means.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result that the first image pickup means takes an image of an electronic device to be tested held on the first contact arm, the image processing means recognizes a relative position of the electronic device to be tested held on the first contact arm with respect to the contact portion based on the taken image information, and the contact arm position correction means corrects a position of the first contact arm holding the electronic device to be tested based on the recognition, it becomes possible to attain accurate contact of the electronic device to be tested and the contact portion and to reduce the frequency of erroneous contact.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, while it is not particularly limited in the above invention, preferably, the first contact arm comprises a holding side contact arm for holding the electronic device to be tested; a fixing side contact arm fixed to the moving means; and a lock-and-free means provided between the holding side contact arm and the fixing side contact arm, for restricting or non-restricting a planar movement of the holding side contact arm with respect to the fixing side contact arm on a X-Y plane substantially in parallel with the contact portion.</p>

The first opening <b>321</b><i>a </i>provided on the alignment movable portion <b>321</b> has a size sufficiently large for an IC to be tested to pass through but it is not large enough so that a contact members <b>317</b><i>d </i>provided at the bottom end portion of a holding side contact arm <b>317</b> of the movable head portion <b>312</b> explained above cannot pass through it. The alignment movable portion <b>321</b> is arranged so that the first opening <b>321</b><i>a </i>does not interfere with a path of the optical axis OP and to secure a visible range for the alignment CCD camera <b>326</b> to visually recognize at least all input/output terminals HB of an IC to be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The alignment movable portion <b>321</b> is connected to a movable plane <b>3224</b> of an alignment movable portion driving device <b>322</b> explained later on via an alignment movable portion supporting member <b>321</b><i>b</i>, and able to move in the X-axis and Y-axis directions and rotate in the θ rotation direction about the Z-axis.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The holding side contact arm <b>317</b> holding an IC to be tested can perform an alignment in the X-axis and Y-axis directions and in the θ rotation direction about the Z-axis by following a driving operation by the alignment movable portion driving device <b>322</b> in a state where the lock-and-free mechanism <b>318</b> is in a non-restricting state and in a state of being applied with a predetermined pressure to the alignment movable portion <b>321</b> by the Z-axis actuator <b>313</b> of the movable head portion <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the alignment movable portion driving device <b>322</b> (driving means) is a means for moving the alignment movable portion <b>321</b> in the X-axis and Y-axis directions on the XY plane and in the θ rotation direction about the Z-axis, and mainly comprises three driving motors <b>3221</b>, <b>3222</b> and <b>3223</b>, a movable plane <b>3224</b>, movable plane supporting members <b>3225</b> and a foundation <b>3226</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Note that except that it is possible to change to different types of contact arms, the configuration of the electronic device testing apparatus is the same as that in the above second embodiment, so the explanations on the configuration of the electronic device testing apparatus other than the contact arm will be omitted and the same reference numbers will be used for the same components as those in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">A unit having three kinds of contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i>, <b>315</b><i>b </i>and <b>315</b><i>c </i>below can be attached to the movable head portion <b>312</b> of the YZ transfer device <b>310</b> of the electronic device testing apparatus <b>1</b> in the present embodiment.</p>

The first contact arm <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>is capable of performing alignment of a position of an IC to be tested with the contact portion <b>301</b> by image processing and performing a following operation to the plane substantially in parallel with the contact portion <b>301</b> when the IC to be tested contacts the contact portion <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Four first contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>configured as above are held by a base member <b>340</b> to compose one unit, wherein all air piping introduced from the respective contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>is connected to the first air path <b>340</b><i>a </i>formed on the base member <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Next, the second contact arm <b>315</b><i>b </i>comprises, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the above plane following mechanism <b>330</b> and the holding side contact arm <b>317</b> and attached to the lower surface of the base member <b>340</b> in this order.

<p id="p-0269" num="0268">A shape of the base member <b>340</b> for supporting the second contact arm <b>315</b><i>b </i>is substantially the same shape as one holding the first contact arm <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>and the first air path <b>340</b><i>a </i>is formed also at substantially the same position, but since the second contact arm <b>315</b><i>b </i>is not provided with the lock-and-free mechanism <b>318</b>, the air path for supplying an air for a centering operation and restricting is not formed on the base member <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">ICs to be tested of a kind to be dealt by the second contact arm <b>315</b><i>b </i>do not require alignment for conducting a test thereon, so that the YZ transfer device <b>310</b> directly transfers the ICs to be tested from the loader buffer portion <b>502</b> of the loader section <b>50</b> to the contact portion <b>301</b>. When the ICs to be tested are positioned above the contact portion <b>301</b>, the YZ transfer device <b>310</b> lowers the movable head portion <b>312</b> of the YZ transfer device <b>310</b> to detect terminals or an upper surface of the contact portions <b>301</b>. The detection of the terminals or the upper surface of the contact portion <b>301</b> may be performed by a torque limiter of the Z-axis direction actuator <b>313</b> for elevating and lowering the movable head portion <b>312</b> or an approaching sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">When the terminals or upper surface of the contact portion <b>301</b> are detected, a test is conducted at a time on four ICs to be tested by pressing to the contact portion <b>301</b> by adding a previously set terminal change amount to a stroke to the terminals or the upper surface of the contact portion <b>301</b>. In the case erroneous contact occurs during the test, a contact stroke amount is gradually increased from the amount up to then until erroneous contact does not occur. At this time, when the contact stroke amount in total exceeds the upper limit, a warning is given at the point. Note that alignment of the IC to be tested with the contact portion <b>301</b> is performed by fitting the concave portion formed at the end portion of the change kit <b>350</b> in a not shown convex portion provided near the contact portion <b>301</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0276" num="0275">A shape of the base member <b>340</b> for holding the third contact arm <b>315</b><i>c </i>is substantially the same shape as what held by the first contact arm <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>and the first air path <b>340</b><i>a </i>is formed at substantially the same position. However, the third contact arm <b>315</b><i>c </i>is not provided with the lock-and-free mechanism <b>318</b>, so that the base member <b>340</b> is not formed an air path for supplying an air to the lock-and-free mechanism <b>318</b>. On the other hand, the third contact arm <b>315</b><i>c </i>is provided with the diaphragm unit <b>360</b>, so that the base member <b>340</b> is formed an air path for supplying an air to the diaphragm unit <b>360</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0278" num="0277">When the terminals or upper surface of the contact portion <b>301</b> are detected, a test is conducted at a time on four ICs to be tested by slightly lowering the movable head portion <b>312</b> to a stroke to the terminals or upper surface of the contact portion <b>301</b> and supplying an air pressure set in advance in accordance with a reactive force of the terminals of the contact portion <b>301</b> from the respective accuracy regulators <b>365</b> to the respective diaphragm cylinders <b>361</b>. The set air pressure at this time is a value in accordance with the arrangement and number of the contact portion <b>301</b> and the arrangement and number of ICs to be tested picked up by the contact arms <b>315</b><i>c</i>. In the case erroneous contact occurs during the test, the air pressure to be supplied to the diaphragm cylinder <b>361</b> is gradually raised until erroneous contact does not occur. At this time, when the air pressure exceeds the upper limit value, a malfunction warning is given at the point. Note that alignment of the IC to be tested with the contact portion <b>301</b> is performed by fitting the concave portion formed at the end portion of the change kit <b>350</b> in a not shown convex portion provided near the contact portion <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">On the root portion <b>314</b> of the YZ transfer device <b>310</b> of the present embodiment, a second air path <b>314</b><i>a </i>is formed by penetrating from the upper surface to the lower surface at a position corresponding to the first air piping <b>314</b><i>a </i>formed on the base member <b>340</b> of the unit having respective types of contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, <b>315</b><i>b </i>and <b>315</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0280" num="0279">As explained above, by making it possible to change to a unit having a suitable contact arm in accordance with aligning accuracy and accuracy of pressing force management required by every kind of ICs to be tested at the time of the contact, functions required for the contact arm can be optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">For example, when dealing with ICs to be tested of a kind requiring highly accurate alignment at the time of the contact, a unit having four first contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>is attached to the root portion <b>314</b> of the YZ transfer device <b>310</b> for handling the IC to be tested of the kind. During this time, when a base member <b>340</b> of the unit having four first contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>is attached to the root portion <b>314</b>, the first air path <b>340</b><i>a </i>for suction, a centering operation and restricting of the base member <b>340</b> of the unit is connected to the second air path <b>314</b><i>a </i>for suction, a centering operation and restricting of the root portion <b>314</b>.

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">On the other hand, when dealing with ICs to be tested of a kind not requiring aligning accuracy very much and not requiring strict management of a pressing force at the time of the contact, for example, the base member <b>340</b> of the unit having four first contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>is detached from the root portion <b>314</b> by unscrewing the bolt and a base member <b>340</b> of a unit having four second contact arms <b>315</b><i>b </i>is attached so as to handle the ICs to be tested of the kind. During this time, when the base member <b>340</b> of a unit having four second contact arms <b>315</b><i>b </i>is attached to the root portion <b>314</b>, only the first air path <b>340</b><i>a </i>for suction of the base member <b>340</b> of the unit is connected to the second air path <b>314</b><i>a </i>for suction of the root portion <b>314</b>.

<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Also, when dealing with ICs to be tested of a kind not requiring aligning accuracy very much but requiring strict management of a pressing force at the time of the contact, for example, the base member <b>340</b> of the unit having four first contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>or the base member <b>340</b> of the unit having four second contact arms <b>315</b><i>b </i>before changing a kind is detached from the root portion <b>314</b> by unscrewing the bolt and a base member <b>340</b> of a unit having four third contact arms <b>315</b><i>c </i>is attached so as to handle the ICs to be tested of the kind. During this time, when the base member <b>340</b> of a unit having four third contact arms <b>315</b><i>c </i>is attached to the root portion <b>314</b>, only the first air path <b>340</b><i>a </i>for suction and pressing of the base member <b>340</b> of the unit is connected to the second air path <b>314</b><i>a </i>for suction and pressing of the root portion <b>314</b>. Note that the base member <b>340</b> of the unit is not formed the first air path <b>340</b><i>a </i>for a centering operation and restricting, the second air path <b>314</b><i>a </i>for a centering operation and a restricting operation of the root portion <b>314</b> become a closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">As explained above, in the test of ICs to be tested of a kind not requiring alignment accuracy very much at the time of the contact, by changing the unit having the first contact arms <b>315</b><i>a</i><sub>2 </sub>to the unit having the second contact arms <b>315</b><i>b </i>or the unit having the third contact arms <b>315</b><i>c</i>, functions required to the contact arms can be optimized. Also, when compared with the cases of the above first to third embodiments, a range of kinds of ICs to be tested able to be dealt with an identical electronic device testing apparatus can become remarkably wide.</p>
