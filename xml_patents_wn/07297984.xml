<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor light-emitting device has a pair of leads placed in parallel, a light-emitting element on the upper end of one lead, a bonding wire for electrically connecting the semiconductor light-emitting element of the upper end of another lead, and an envelope formed from a light-transmitting resin for sealing the semiconductor light-emitting element, the bonding wire, and the upper end of the leads, provided with a non-circular lateral cross-sectional surface structure with a long axis and a short axis. In the device, when observed along a direction in which the plurality of light-emitting devices are mounted on a same lead frame, a curvature of the lateral direction of said envelope is smaller than a curvature of the vertical direction of said envelope.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the mounted section of the semiconductor light-emitting element <b>10</b> of the lead groups and the upper end section of the bonding wire <b>11</b> and the leads <b>9</b>, <b>9</b>′ are sealed in an envelope <b>14</b> formed by the light-transmitting resin.

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Recently, there have been demands for semiconductor light-emitting devices with a high output. Also, it is commonly known that the diameter <b>14</b>D of the light-emitting device <b>14</b> should be made as large as possible to successfully obtain high output.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, for good production efficiency in this manufacturing method for the conventional semiconductor light-emitting device, the spacing between the lead groups is set so that it is possible to form about 10 to 30 semiconductor light-emitting devices using one lead frame, and, in addition, the diameter <b>13</b>D of the envelope depends on the spacing of the lead groups on the lead frame. For this reason, there is the problem that even when it is desired to increase the diameter of the envelope to obtain high output, this diameter is limited by the spacing of the lead groups. In addition, when the spacing of the lead groups is increased to provide an envelope with a large diameter, the number of semiconductor light-emitting devices obtained from one lead frame is reduced. This results in the problem of poor production efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Other features of this invention will become apparent in the course of the following description of exemplary embodiments which are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">First of all, we will describe the features of the resent invention for clearly understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The lateral cross-section of the envelope for a semiconductor light-emitting device of the present invention has a long axis <b>601</b> and a short axis <b>602</b> and has a non-circular shape symmetrical around these axes <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">By positioning the short axis <b>602</b> so that it is parallel to the longitudinal direction of the lead frame <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, and by positioning the long axis <b>601</b> so that it is perpendicular to the short axis <b>602</b>. it is possible to lengthen the long axis <b>601</b> without changing the spacing of the lead groups on the lead frame <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is therefore possible to provide a large area as compared to a circle in which the length of the short axis <b>802</b> is the diameter, therefore the external efficiency of the light-emitting element is improved and the output of light emitted from the semiconductor light-emitting device can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, by arranging lead frames <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> in parallel stages and offsetting these envelopes <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> alternately in the longitudinal direction, it is possible to make the long axis longer than the spacing “L” of the lead frames <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>, thus increasing the light output.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A first embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing a semiconductor light-emitting element mounted on and bonded to a lead frame.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the reference numeral <b>1</b> designates a lead frame. A plurality of lead groups, each made up of a pair of leads <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>′, is formed at a uniform spacing in the longitudinal direction of the lead frame <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the reference numeral <b>5</b> designates an envelope adjusting jig. A plurality of cavities <b>6</b> with circular lateral cross-sections and almost U-shaped longitudinal cross-sections is positionally arranged in a straight line at the same spacing as the lead groups on the lead frame.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In each lead group <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>′, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a concave section is provided in a thick section of the upper end of the one lead <b>2</b>, and a semiconductor light-emitting element <b>3</b> is mounted, using a conductive adhesive, on the bottom of this concave section.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An adhesive temperature of 200° C. to 300° C. is used at this time. Then, the semiconductor light-emitting element <b>3</b> and the upper end of the other lead <b>2</b>′ are electrically connected by a metal wire <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cavities <b>6</b> of the envelope adjusting jig <b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are filled with a light-transmitting resin (a liquid mixture of epoxy resin and a curing agent), the lead groups are immersed in the light-transmitting resin in the cavities <b>6</b> in the envelope adjusting jig <b>5</b>, and placed for two to some tens of hours in an oven maintained at 100° C. to 130° C., for curing.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the semiconductor light-emitting element <b>3</b>, the metal wire (for example, Fe wire), and the upper section of the lead group are immersed into the above-mentioned liquid mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">After thermal curing, the lead groups are separated from the envelope adjusting jig <b>5</b>, and the lead groups are completely cut away from the lead frame <b>1</b> at the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the above-described first embodiment of the semiconductor light-emitting device and method for manufacturing the device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 9A</figref> and <b>9</b>B, the envelope is shaped as an ellipse.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">By making the length of the short axis <b>602</b> of the lateral cross-section of the ellipse equal to the diameter <b>13</b>D of the circle of the envelop shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, it is possible to produce the same number of semiconductor light-emitting devices from one lead frame as in the conventional example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When comparing the output of light for the conventional example and for this embodiment, for the area of the lateral cross-section IXB-IXB′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the length of the short axis <b>902</b> of the ellipse, which is the cross-sectional shape of the envelope of this embodiment, and the length of the diameter <b>902</b> of the circle shown by the dotted line <b>903</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, which is the cross-sectional shape of the envelope <b>13</b> of the conventional example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, are the same, therefore the length of the long axis <b>901</b> of the ellipse of this embodiment is larger.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the cross-sectional area of the envelope is large, it is possible to consider the semiconductor light-emitting element as a point light-emitting source of no magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For this reason, the light-emitting element <b>3</b> can be positioned at an optically ideal geometrical position, so that remarkably improved light condensing characteristics can be provided, and the ratio of the light passing through the interior of the resin which is reflected from the surface <b>97</b> of the light-transmitting resin shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is low.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Accordingly, the external light-emitting efficiency is improved, and a semiconductor light-emitting device is obtained with a higher than conventional output.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Other preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> are diagrams showing a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> are diagrams showing a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Parts which are identical or which correspond to the parts in the first embodiment have been designated by the same reference numerals as in the first embodiment so a further detailed explanation has been omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Specifically, in the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the lateral cross-sectional shape of the envelope is that of a circle of which part is cut off along the long axis.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Also, in the third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the lateral cross-sectional shape of the envelope is that of an ellipse of which part is cut off along the long axis.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The shapes of these envelopes are obtained by using envelope adjusting jigs with cavities provided with the desired cross-sectional shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The same effect is obtained in each of these two embodiments as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view of the envelope adjusting jigs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> with these jigs arranged in two rows so that the jigs in the lower row are alternately offset and positioned at the midpoint of the spacing of the jigs in the upper row in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">By this arrangement, the lateral cross-section is even longer in the long axis direction as a result of the displacement of the cavities in the longitudinal direction, and, specifically, a semiconductor light-emitting device with a higher output is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, even if the cross-sectional shape is unchanged, it is possible to pack the cavity spacing in the longitudinal direction so that more lead frames can be arranged in the same amount of space. Accordingly, the production efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> is a view of the upper surface of the semiconductor light-emitting device as the fifth embodiment according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> is a longitudinal cross section viewed along the line XIII-XIIIB′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">This invention is not limited to the above embodiments. The present invention can be applicable to another semiconductor light-emitting elements, for example, to a semiconductor light-emitting device having three leads <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although, each light-emitting device as the fifth embodiment has a pair of semiconductor light-emitting elements, it is also possible to obtain a semiconductor light-emitting device with a higher output than that of a conventional device without changing the number of semiconductor light-emitting devices obtained from one lead frame.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">By means of the present invention, it is possible to obtain a semiconductor light-emitting device with a higher output than that of a conventional device without changing the number of semiconductor light-emitting devices obtained from one lead frame.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Also, by mean of the present invention, if the output from a semiconductor light-emitting device is kept the same, it is possible to increase the number of semiconductor light-emitting devices obtained from one lead frame, therefore the production efficiency is improved. In addition the size of the jigs can be reduced.</p>
