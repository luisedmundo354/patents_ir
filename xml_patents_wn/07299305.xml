<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 2002-87150, filed on Dec. 30, 2002, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for operating an AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for indicating a connection state of an input/output cable between an ATAPI drive and a host.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">ATAPI drives refer to optical storage devices, such as digital versatile disc (DVD)_read only memory (ROM) drives, CD-ROM drives, CD-RW, CD-R, and tape backup drives that communicate with a computer using an ATAPI protocol. Since the ATAPI drives communicate with the computer using drivers, the drivers must be registered in memory in advance when an operating system (OS) is booted. Therefore, unlike hard discs, the ATAPI drives can communicate with the computer only if the driver is properly loaded in that case.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A technique for communications between such an ATAPI drive and a computer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,105,107.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An ATAPI drive transmits and receives signals with a computer via an input/output (I/O) cable. Even when the ATAPI drive does not receive a command from the computer, the ATAPI drive can operate by applied power. Most ATAPI drives are installed in computers, and can appear operable due to a user mistake or for other reasons even when an I/O cable is not connected properly. In this case, the user cannot access the ATAPI drives. Accordingly, it is difficult to check why the ATAPI drives do not work. Even when the user suspects that the I/O cable is not connected properly, the user cannot find out the exact cause of the abnormality of the ATAPI drives without disassembling the computer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an apparatus and method for indicating the connection state of an I/O cable by which a user can easily check the connection state between an ATAPI drive and a host and utilize the check result to correct the connection problem.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for indicating a connection state of an input/output cable. The apparatus includes an indicator and a controller. The indicator is a communication device between an AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive and a host interconnected via the input/output cable and that indicates in response to a control signal whether the ATAPI drive is connected to or disconnected from the host via the input/output cable. The controller sets a flag to check the connection state of the input/output cable, when power is applied to the ATAPI drive, and outputs the control signal to the indicator to indicate that the input/output cable is not connected to the host when a command is not received from the host for a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The apparatus further includes a timer that counts a time required for receiving the command from the host.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an aspect of the present invention, the indicator is a light emitting diode that turns on in response to the control signal output from the controller, when the host is connected to the ATAPI drive via the input/output cable, and turns off when the host is not connected to the ATAPI drive via the input/output cable.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the present invention, the controller clears the set flag when the command is received from the host within the predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an aspect of the present invention, the controller clears the set flag after the indicator indicates that the input/output cable is not connected to the host.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of indicating a connection state of an input/output cable via which an AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive communicates with a host. The method includes: when power is applied to the AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive, setting a flag that checks the connection state of the input/output cable; if a command is not received from the host for a predetermined period of time after the flag is set, commanding a timer to increase a time; and if the increased time exceeds a reference time, indicating that the input/output cable is not connected to the host.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In commanding the timer to increase the time, if the command is received from the host for the predetermined period of time, the set flag is cleared.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">After the indication that the input/output cable is not connected to the host, the set flag is cleared.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an apparatus for indicating the connection state of an I/O cable, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The apparatus includes a host <b>100</b> and an ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. The host <b>100</b> is connected to the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> via an I/O cable. The ATAPI drive <b>101</b> includes a controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b>, a timer <b>101</b>-<b>2</b>, and an indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart for explaining a method of indicating the connection state of an I/O cable, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in operation <b>200</b>, power is applied to a host and an ATAPI drive. In operation <b>201</b>, a flag is set to check whether an I/O cable is connected. In operation <b>202</b>, a determination is made as to whether a command is received from the host via the I/O cable. If in operation <b>202</b>, it is determined that the command has been received from the host via the I/O cable, in operation <b>203</b>, the flag is cleared. If in operation <b>202</b>, it is determined that the command has not been received from the host via the I/O cable, in operation <b>204</b>, a determination is made as to whether the flag has been set. If in operation <b>204</b>, it is determined that the flag has not been set, the process ends. If in operation <b>204</b>, it is determined that the flag has been set, in operation <b>205</b>, a timer increases a time count. In operation <b>206</b>, a determination is made as to whether the increased time exceeds a reference time. If in operation <b>206</b>, it is determined that the increased time exceeds the reference time, in operation <b>207</b>, a disconnection of the I/O cable from the host is indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The above-described apparatus and method will be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The apparatus will be first explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When power is applied to the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>, the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> initializes various software programs and hardware components and goes to a main loop. Before the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> goes to the main loop, the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> checks whether the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. Next, the ATAP drive <b>101</b> performs an operation corresponding to the check result. The ATAPI drive <b>101</b> includes the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b>, the timer <b>101</b>-<b>2</b>, and the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When power is applied to the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> sets a specific flag to check whether the I/O cable is connected. Thereafter, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> waits to receive a command from the host <b>100</b>. If the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> receives the command from the host <b>100</b> after setting the specific flag, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> clears the specific flag and stops checking whether the I/O cable is connected. Here, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> may output an indication control signal to the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> to indicate that the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">However, if the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> does not receive the command from the host <b>100</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> re-checks whether the flag has been set. If it is determined that the flag has been set, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> commands the timer <b>101</b>-<b>2</b> to increase the time count. Next, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> determines whether the increased time exceeds a reference time, for example, about <b>1</b> minute. If it is determined that the increased time exceeds the reference time, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> determines that the I/O cable has not been connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. The controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> may output an indication control signal to the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> to indicate that the I/O cable is not connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. The indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> indicates in response to the indication control signal that the I/O cable is not connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. The indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> may be a light emitting diode (LED). Thus, if the host <b>100</b> is connected to the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> via the I/O cable, the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> may turn off in response to the indication control signal. If the host <b>100</b> is not connected to the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> via the I/O cable, the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> may turn on in response to the indication control signal. After the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> indicates whether the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> clears the flag and stops checking whether the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. Alternatively, different colored LEDs or labeled LEDs may be used to indicate the connection state of the I/O cable.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, the method will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In operation <b>200</b>, power is applied to the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. The ATAPI drive <b>101</b> then initializes various software programs and hardware components and goes to the main loop. Prior to going to the main loop, the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> checks whether the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> and performs an operation corresponding to the check result.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In operation <b>201</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> sets the flag which checks a connection state of the I/O cable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In operation <b>202</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> determines whether the command is received from the host <b>100</b> via the I/O cable.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If in operation <b>202</b>, it is determined that the command has been received from the host <b>100</b> via the I/O cable, in operation <b>203</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> clears the flag. In other words, when the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> sets the flag and then receives the command from the host <b>100</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> clears the flag and stops checking the connection state of the I/O cable. The controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> may output the indication control signal to the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> to indicate that the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If in operation <b>202</b>, it is determined that the command has not been received from the host <b>100</b> via the I/O cable, in operation <b>204</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> rechecks whether the flag has been set.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If in operation <b>204</b>, it is determined that the flag has been set, in operation <b>205</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> commands the timer <b>101</b>-<b>2</b> to increase a time counter.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation <b>206</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> determines whether the increased time exceeds a reference time preset by the timer <b>101</b>-<b>2</b>. If in operation <b>206</b>, it is determined that the increased time does not exceed the reference time, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> returns to operation <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If in operation <b>206</b>, it is determined that the increased time exceeds the reference time, in operation <b>207</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> determines that the I/O cable has not been connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> and outputs the indication control signal to the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> so as to indicate this determination result. As a result, the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> indicates in response to the indication control signal that the I/O cable is not connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>. The indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> may be a light emitting diode (LED). As an example, if the host <b>100</b> is connected to the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> via the I/O cable, the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> may turn off in response to the indication control signal. If the host <b>100</b> is not connected to the ATAPI drive <b>101</b> via the I/O cable, the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> may turn on in response to the indication control signal. After the indicator <b>101</b>-<b>3</b> indicates whether the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>, the controller <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> clears the flag and stops checking whether the I/O cable is connected between the host <b>100</b> and the ATAPI drive <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, according to the present invention, a user can check the connection state of an I/O cable between an ATAPI drive and a host and take the necessary action to remedy the problem. When the I/O cable is not connected between the ATAPI drive and the host, an indicator indicates the disconnection state of the I/O cable. Thus, the user can check the indication result via the indicator and directly connect the I/O cable between the ATAPI drive and the host. As a result, the user can solve the disconnection problem without calling or visiting an after-sale service (A/S) center.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although a few exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>

<claims id="claims">
<claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001">
<claim-text>1. An apparatus for indicating a connection state of an input/output cable, comprising:
<claim-text>an indicator that is a communication device between an AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive and a host interconnected via the input/output cable and that indicates in response to a control signal whether the AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive is connected to or disconnected from the host via the input/output cable;</claim-text>
<claim-text>a timer that counts a time required for receiving the command from the host; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>a controller that sets a flag to check the connection state of the input/output cable, when power is applied to the AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive, and outputs a signal to the timer to increase a time counter, when a command is not received from the host for a predetermined period of time after determining the flag is set, and outputs the control signal to the indicator to indicate that the input/output cable is not connected to the host when the increased time exceeds a reference time,</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the indicator is a light emitting diode that turns on in response to the control signal output from the controller, when the host is connected to the AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive via the input/output cable, and turns off when the host is not connected to the AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) drive via the input/output cable, and</claim-text>
<claim-text>the controller clears the set flag when the command is received from the host for the predetermined period of time.</claim-text>
