<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to phenoxy amine compounds for delivering active agents, such as biologically or chemically active agents, to a target. These compounds are well suited for forming non-covalent mixtures with active agents for oral, intracolonic, pulmonary, and other routes of administration to animals. Methods for the preparation and administration of such compositions are also disclosed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional means for delivering active agents are often severely limited by biological, chemical, and physical barriers. Typically, these barriers are imposed by the environment through which delivery occurs, the environment of the target for delivery, and/or the target itself. Biologically and chemically active agents are particularly vulnerable to such barriers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the delivery to animals of biologically active and chemically active pharmacological and therapeutic agents, barriers are imposed by the body. Examples of physical barriers are the skin, lipid bi-layers and various organ membranes that are relatively impermeable to certain active agents but must be traversed before reaching a target, such as the circulatory system. Chemical barriers include, but are not limited to, pH variations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and degrading enzymes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">These barriers are of particular significance in the design of oral delivery systems. Oral delivery of many biologically or chemically active agents would be the route of choice for administration to animals if not for biological, chemical, and physical barriers. Among the numerous agents which are not typically amenable to oral administration are biologically or chemically active peptides, such as calcitonin and insulin; polysaccharides, and in particular mucopolysaccharides including, but not limited to, heparin; heparinoids; antibiotics; and other organic substances. These agents may be rapidly rendered ineffective or destroyed in the gastro-intestinal tract by acid hydrolysis, enzymes, and the like. In addition, the size and structure of macromolecular drugs may prohibit absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Earlier methods for orally administering vulnerable pharmacological agents have relied on the co-administration of adjuvants (e.g., resorcinols and non-ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether) to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as the co-administration of enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and trasylol) to inhibit enzymatic degradation. Liposomes have also been described as drug delivery systems for insulin and heparin. However, broad spectrum use of such drug delivery systems is precluded because: (1) the systems require toxic amounts of adjuvants or inhibitors; (2) suitable low molecular weight cargos, i.e. active agents, are not available; (3) the systems exhibit poor stability and inadequate shelf life; (4) the systems are difficult to manufacture; (5) the systems fail to protect the active agent (cargo); (6) the systems adversely alter the active agent; or (7) the systems fail to allow or promote absorption of the active agent.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Proteinoid microspheres have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,401,516; 5,443,841; and Re. 35,862. In addition, certain modified amino acids have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,629,020; 5,643,957; 5,766,633; 5,776,888; and 5,866,536.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">More recently, a polymer has been conjugated to a modified amino acid or a derivative thereof via a linkage group to provide for polymeric delivery agents. The modified polymer may be any polymer, but preferred polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and derivatives thereof. See, for example, International Patent Publication No. WO 00/40203.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01/32130 and WO 01/32596 disclose particular phenyl amine carboxylic acid compounds and phenoxy carboxylic acid compounds for delivering active agents. International Publication No. WO 00/50386 also discloses amine delivery agents.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, there is still a need for simple, inexpensive delivery systems which are easily prepared and which can deliver a broad range of active agents by various routes.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides compounds and compositions which facilitate the delivery of active agents. Delivery agent compounds of the present invention include those having the following formula:</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Delivery Agent Compounds</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">The terms “alkyl”, “alkenyl”, and “alkynyl” as used herein include linear and branched alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl substituents, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">The delivery agent compounds may be in the form of the free base or salts thereof. Suitable salts include, but are not limited to, organic and inorganic salts, for example ammonium, acetate salt, citrate salt, halide (preferably hydrochloride), hydroxide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, alkoxy, perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate, carboxylate, mesylate, fumerate, malonate, succinate, tartrate, acetate, gluconate, and maleate. Preferred salts include, but are not limited to, citrate and mesylate salts. The salts may also be solvates, including ethanol solvates, and hydrates.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">Salts of the delivery agent compounds of the present invention may be prepared by methods known in the art. For example, citrate salts and mesylate salts may be prepared in ethanol, toluene and citric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">In general, the amine compounds of the present invention, i.e. where R<sup>7 </sup>is —NR<sup>18</sup>R<sup>19</sup>, may be prepared by reacting the appropriate phenyl with either (1) the appropriate dihalogenated alkyl chain or (2) the appropriate haloalkylalcohol which can then be transformed into an appropriate leaving group, such as a methane sulfonic ester (e.g., by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride), creating an ether compound with an active leaving group that is subsequently reacted with the appropriate amine optionally in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine. To obtain the corresponding salt the amine compound is reacted with the appropriate acid, i.e. to make the citric acid salt, the amine is reacted with citric acid and preferably with an excess of citric acid. To obtain the corresponding quaternary ammonium salt where R<sup>7 </sup>is —NR<sup>18</sup>R<sup>19</sup>R<sup>20 </sup>(where R<sup>18</sup>, R<sup>19</sup>, R<sup>20 </sup>are not hydrogen), the amine moiety of the amine compound is alkylated by methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">The delivery agent compound may be purified by recrystallization or by fractionation on one or more solid chromatographic supports, alone or linked in tandem. Suitable recrystallization solvent systems include, but are not limited to, ethanol, water, heptane, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) and mixtures thereof. Fractionation may be performed on a suitable chromatographic support such as alumina, using methanol/n-propanol mixtures as the mobile phase; reverse phase chromatography using trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile mixtures as the mobile phase; and ion exchange chromatography using water or an appropriate buffer as the mobile phase. When anion exchange chromatography is performed, preferably a 0-500 mM sodium chloride gradient is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">The delivery agent may contain a polymer conjugated to it by a linkage group selected from the group consisting of —NHC(O)NH—, —C(O)NH—, —NHC(O), —OOC—, —COO—, —NHC(O)O—, —OC(O)NH—, —CH<sub>2</sub>NH—NHCH<sub>2</sub>—, —CH<sub>2</sub>NHC(O)O—, —OC(O)NHCH<sub>2</sub>—, —CH<sub>2</sub>NHCOCH<sub>2</sub>O—, —OCH<sub>2</sub>C(O)NHCH<sub>2</sub>—, —NHC(O)CH<sub>2</sub>O—, —OCH<sub>2</sub>C(O)NH—, —NH—, —O—, and carbon-carbon bond, with the proviso that the polymeric delivery agent is not a polypeptide or polyamino acid. The polymer may be any polymer including, but not limited to, alternating copolymers, block copolymers and random copolymers, which are safe for use in mammals. Preferred polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene; polyacrylates; polymethacrylates; poly(oxyethylene); poly(propylene); polypropylene glycol; polyethylene glycol (PEG); and derivatives thereof and combinations thereof. The molecular weight of the polymer typically ranges from about 100 to about 200,000 daltons. The molecular weight of the polymer preferably ranges from about 200 to about 10,000 daltons. In one embodiment, the molecular weight of the polymer ranges from about 200 to about 600 daltons and more preferably ranges from about 300 to about 550 daltons.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Active Agents</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">Active agents suitable for use in the present invention include biologically active agents and chemically active agents, including, but not limited to, pesticides, pharmacological agents, and therapeutic agents. Suitable active agents include those that are rendered less effective, ineffective or are destroyed in the gastro-intestinal tract by acid hydrolysis, enzymes and the like. Also included as suitable active agents are those macromolecular agents whose physiochemical characteristics, such as, size, structure or charge, prohibit or impede absorption when dosed orally.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">For example, biologically or chemically active agents suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, proteins; polypeptides; peptides; hormones; polysaccharides, and particularly mixtures of muco-polysaccharides; carbohydrates; lipids; small polar organic molecules (i.e. polar organic molecules having a molecular weight of 500 daltons or less); other organic compounds; and particularly compounds which by themselves do not pass (or which pass only a fraction of the administered dose) through the gastro-intestinal mucosa and/or are susceptible to chemical cleavage by acids and enzymes in the gastro-intestinal tract; or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">Further examples include, but are not limited to, the following, including synthetic, natural or recombinant sources thereof: growth hormones, including human growth hormones (hGH), recombinant human growth hormones (rhGH), bovine growth hormones, and porcine growth hormones; growth hormone releasing hormones; growth hormone releasing factor, interferons, including α (e.g., interferon alfacon-1 (available as Infergen® from InterMune, Inc. of Brisbane, Calif.)), β and γ; interleukin-1; interleukin-2; insulin, including porcine, bovine, human, and human recombinant, optionally having counter ions including zinc, sodium, calcium and ammonium; insulin-like growth factor, including IGF-1; heparin, including unfractionated heparin, heparinoids, dermatans, chondroitins, low molecular weight heparin, very low molecular weight heparin and ultra low molecular weight heparin; calcitonin, including salmon, eel, porcine and human; erythropoietin; atrial naturetic factor; antigens; monoclonal antibodies; somatostatin; protease inhibitors; adrenocorticotropin, gonadotropin releasing hormone; oxytocin; leutinizing-hormone-releasing-hormone; follicle stimulating hormone; glucocerebrosidase; thrombopoietin; filgrastim; prostaglandins; cyclosporin; vasopressin; cromolyn sodium (sodium or disodium chromoglycate); vancomycin; desferrioxamine (DFO); bisphosphonates, including alendronate, tiludronate, etidronate, clodronate, pamidronate, olpadronate, and incadronate; parathyroid hormone (PTH), including its fragments; anti-migraine agents such as BIBN-4096BS and other calcitonin gene-related proteins antagonists; glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1); antimicrobials, including antibiotics, anti-bacterials and anti-fungal agents; vitamins; analogs, fragments, mimetics or polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified derivatives of these compounds; or any combination thereof. Non-limiting examples of antibiotics include gram-positive acting, bacteriocidal, lipopeptidal and cyclic peptidal antibiotics, such as daptomycin and analogs thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Delivery Systems</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">The composition of the present invention comprises one or more delivery agent compounds of the present invention, and one or more active agents. In one embodiment, one or more of the delivery agent compounds, or salts of these compounds, or poly amino acids or peptides of which these compounds or salts form one or more of the units thereof, may be used as a delivery agent by mixing with the active agent prior to administration to form an administration composition.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">The administration compositions may be in the form of a liquid. The solution medium may be water (for example, for salmon calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and erythropoietin), 25% aqueous propylene glycol (for example, for heparin) and phosphate buffer (for example, for rhGH). Other dosing vehicles include polyethylene glycol. Dosing solutions may be prepared by mixing a solution of the delivery agent compound with a solution of the active agent, just prior to administration. Alternately, a solution of the delivery agent compound (or active agent) may be mixed with the solid form of the active agent (or delivery agent compound). The delivery agent compound and the active agent may also be mixed as dry powders. The delivery agent compound and the active agent can also be admixed during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">The dosing solutions may optionally contain additives such as phosphate buffer salts, citric acid, glycols, or other dispersing agents. Stabilizing additives may be incorporated into the solution, preferably at a concentration ranging between about 0.1 and 20% (w/v).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">The administration compositions may alternately be in the form of a solid, such as a tablet, capsule or particle, such as a powder or sachet. Solid dosage forms may be prepared by mixing the solid form of the compound with the solid form of the active agent. Alternately, a solid may be obtained from a solution of compound and active agent by methods known in the art, such as freeze-drying (lyophilization), precipitation, crystallization and solid dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">The administration compositions of the present invention may also include one or more enzyme inhibitors. Such enzyme inhibitors include, but are not limited to, compounds such as actinonin or epiactinonin and derivatives thereof. Other enzyme inhibitors include, but are not limited to, aprotinin (Trasylol) and Bowman-Birk inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">The amount of active agent used in an administration composition of the present invention is an amount effective to accomplish the purpose of the particular active agent for the target indication. The amount of active agent in the compositions typically is a pharmacologically, biologically, therapeutically, or chemically effective amount. However, the amount can be less than that amount when the composition is used in a dosage unit form because the dosage unit form may contain a plurality of delivery agent compound/active agent compositions or may contain a divided pharmacologically, biologically, therapeutically, or chemically effective amount. The total effective amount can then be administered in cumulative units containing, in total, an effective amount of the active agent.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">The total amount of active agent to be used can be determined by methods known to those skilled in the art. However, because the compositions of the invention may deliver active agents more efficiently than compositions containing the active agent alone, lower amounts of biologically or chemically active agents than those used in prior dosage unit forms or delivery systems can be administered to the subject, while still achieving the same blood levels and/or therapeutic effects.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">The presently disclosed delivery agent compounds facilitate the delivery of biologically and chemically active agents, particularly in oral, intranasal, sublingual, intraduodenal, subcutaneous, buccal, intracolonic, rectal, vaginal, mucosal, pulmonary, transdermal, intradermal, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular and ocular systems, as well as traversing the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Dosage unit forms can also include any one or combination of excipients, diluents, disintegrants, lubricants, plasticizers, colorants, flavorants, taste-masking agents, sugars, sweeteners, salts, and dosing vehicles, including, but not limited to, water, 1,2-propane diol, ethanol, olive oil, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">The compounds and compositions of the subject invention are useful for administering biologically or chemically active agents to any animals, including but not limited to birds such as chickens; mammals, such as rodents, cows, pigs, dogs, cats, primates, and particularly humans; and insects.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">The system is particularly advantageous for delivering chemically or biologically active agents that would otherwise be destroyed or rendered less effective by conditions encountered before the active agent reaches its target zone (i.e. the area in which the active agent of the delivery composition is to be released) and within the body of the animal to which they are administered. Particularly, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for orally administering active agents, especially those that are not ordinarily orally deliverable, or those for which improved delivery is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">The compositions comprising the compounds and active agents have utility in the delivery of active agents to selected biological systems and in an increased or improved bioavailability of the active agent compared to administration of the active agent without the delivery agent. Delivery can be improved by delivering more active agent over a period of time, or in delivering the active agent in a particular time period (such as to effect quicker or delayed delivery), or in delivering the active agent at a specific time, or over a period of time (such as sustained delivery).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for the treatment or prevention of a disease or for achieving a desired physiological effect, such as those listed in the table below, in an animal by administering the composition of the present invention. Preferably, an effective amount of the composition for the treatment or prevention of the desired disease or for achieving the desired physiological effect is administered. Specific indications for active agents can be found in the Physicians' Desk Reference (54<sup>th </sup>Ed., 2000, Medical Economics Company, Inc., Montvale, N.J.), which is herein incorporated by reference. The active agents in the table below include their analogs, fragments, mimetics, and polyethylene glycol-modified derivatives.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0074">For example, one embodiment of the present invention is a method for treating a patient suffering from or susceptible to diabetes by administering insulin and at least one of the delivery agent compounds of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">Following administration, the active agent present in the composition or dosage unit form is taken up into the circulation. The bioavailability of the agent can be readily assessed by measuring a known pharmacological activity in blood, e.g. an increase in blood clotting time caused by heparin, or a decrease in circulating calcium levels caused by calcitonin. Alternately, the circulating levels of the active agent itself can be measured directly.</p>

A solution of the delivery agent compound is made. The delivery agent compound solution is prepared in phosphate buffer and stirred. If necessary, the pH of the mixture is adjusted upwards by the addition of aliquots of NaOH of an appropriate normality until the delivery agent compound is completely dissolved. The final pH of the dissolved delivery agent compound is between 7.5 and 9.5. The final dosing solutions are prepared by mixing 9 volumes of the delivery agent compound solution with 1 volume of a bRNase A stock solution (20 mg bRNase A in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). Final concentrations are 150 mg/ml delivery agent compound and 2 mg/ml bRNase A.</p>

The reaction mix is then dialyzed (10,000 MW cutoff dialysis membrane (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.)) against 4 liters of PBS at 4° C. overnight. The reaction mixture is placed in 4 liters of fresh PBS and dialyzed for an additional 4 hours. The dialyzed bRNase A is removed from the dialysis membrane, diluted to a final volume of 25 ml with PBS (final concentration of bRNase A=20 mg/ml), and stored a 4° C.</p>

After washing, the plates are incubated for 2 hours with a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon, Pittsburgh, Pa.) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The plates are washed after the incubation and the amount of initially captured bRNase A is detected by the addition of para-nitrophenyl phosphate (a substrate for alkaline phosphatase) (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). The amount of bRNase A circulating in the original rat sera is quantitated by comparison with a standard curve of bRNAse A which extends from 1000-0.1 ng/mL in fifteen two-fold dilutions.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200-250 g were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing. A dosing group of five rats was administered one of the dosing solutions. For oral gavage (PO) dosing, an 11 cm Rusch 8 French catheter was adapted to a 1 mL syringe with a pipette tip. The syringe was filled with dosing solution by drawing the solution through the catheter, which was then wiped dry. The catheter was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the incisors. Solution was administered by pressing the syringe plunger. Blood samples were collected serially from the tail artery, typically at time=0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes for oral. Plasma BIBN4096BS concentrations were quantified by using a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry assay method using UV detection. The standard range for the assay was 5-2,000 ng/mL. Previous studies indicated baseline values of about 10 ng/mL. The maximum is reported below in Table 3.</p>

2d. Oral Delivery of Daptomycin
<br/>
2d. Daptomycin—Oral/Intracolonic Delivery
</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0145">Dosing solutions containing a delivery agent compound and daptomycin (Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass.) were prepared in 0.9% normal saline. A solution of the compound was made either with the sodium salt of the compound or by converting the free acid to its sodium salt. The free acid of the delivery agent compound was converted to the sodium salt with one equivalent of sodium hydroxide. This mixture was vortexed and placed in a sonicator (about 37° C.). The pH was adjusted to about 7.0-7.5 with aqueous HCl or NaOH. Additional NaOH was added, if necessary, to achieve uniform solubility, and the pH readjusted. The mixture was vortexed to produce a uniform solution, also using sonication if necessary. The delivery agent compound solution was mixed with daptomycin from a stock solution (200 mg daptomycin/mL in 0.9% normal saline and the pH adjusted, if necessary, to between 6.0-7.0 with NaOH or HCl). The stock solution was stored frozen (−20° C.) wrapped in foil, then thawed and warmed gradually to about 25° C. before using. The delivery agent-daptomycin mixture was vortexed at low speed to produce a uniform solution. The pH was adjusted to about 7.0-7.5 with aqueous NaOH. The solution was then diluted with 0.9% normal saline to the desired volume (usually 2.0 ml) and concentration and stored wrapped in foil before use. The final delivery agent compound and daptomycin doses, and the dose volumes are listed below in Table 4.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0146">The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200-250 g were fasted for 24 hours and were anesthetized with ketamine (44 mg/kg) and thorazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing and again as needed to maintain anesthesia. A dosing group of five animals was administered one of the dosing solutions. For oral gavage (PO) dosing, an 11 cm Rusch 8 French catheter was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with a pipette tip. The syringe was filled with dosing solution by drawing the solution through the catheter, which was then wiped dry. The catheter was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the incisors. Solution was administered by pressing the syringe plunger. For intracolonic (IC) dosing, a 7.5 cm, 8 fr Rusch catheter was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with a pipette tip. The dosing catheter was inserted into the colon through the anus until the tube was no longer visible. The dosing solution was expressed slowly into the colon by pressing the syringe plunger.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0147">Heparinized rat blood samples were collected via the ventral tail artery, typically at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 hours after dosing, and stored on ice. Blood samples were then spun (centrifuged) at 11,500 rpm for 4 minutes at 4° C. to obtain the plasma (supernatant), which was stored at −70° C. The plasma daptomycin concentrations were measured by isocratic reversed phase HPLC, keeping samples at 4° C. during analysis. Blank plasma studies show baseline values of zero.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0148">Results from the animals in each group were averaged for each time point and the highest of these averages (i.e., mean peak daptomycin concentration, C<sub>max</sub>) is reported below in Table 4.</p>

2e. Oral Delivery of human Growth Hormone Releasing Factor Analog (trans-3-henxenoyl hGRF NH<sub>2</sub>)
</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0150">Oral dosing (PO) compositions of delivery agent compound and GRF analog g (available from Theratechnologies, Quebec Canada U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,861,379 and 6,020,311) were prepared in deionized water. Typically, 500 mg of delivery agent compound was added to 1.5 ml of water. The free base of the delivery agent compound was converted to the salt by stirring the resultant solution and adding one equivalent of hydrogen chloride. The solution was vortexed, then heated (at about 37° C.) and sonicated. The pH was adjusted to about 7 to 8.5 with NaOH or HCl. Additional NaOH or HCl was added, if necessary, to achieve uniform solubility, and the pH re-adjusted to about 7 to 8.5. Water was then added to bring the total volume to about 2.4 ml and vortexed. About 25 mg of GRF-Analog stock solution (50 mg/ml made from 100 mg GRF-Analog and 2 ml deionized water, adjusting with HCl to pH 4.0) was added to the solution and mixed by inverting. The solution was immediately used in the dosing protocol, or alternatively, the solution was placed into a 37° C. water bath for one hour prior to dosing.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0151">The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between about 200-250 g were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing and again as needed to maintain anesthesia.

The catheter was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the incisors. The dosing solution was administered by pressing the syringe plunger.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0152">Blood samples were collected serially from the tail artery, typically at time=0, 15, 30, 60, &amp; 120 minutes. Plasma GRF-Analog levels were determined by RIA (first antibody Peninsula Labs, RIN 8061; second antibody Linco Research Labs, 5060-10). Plasma GRF-Analog concentrations (pg/ml) were measured for each time point for each of the five animals in each dosing group. The five values for each time point were averaged and the results plotted as plasma GRF-analog concentration versus time. The maximum (peak) are reported below in Table 6.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0154">Dosing solutions of delivery agent compound and interferon alfacon-1 (IFN) (available as Infergen® from InterMune, Inc. of Brisbane, Calif.) were prepared in deionized water. The free acid of the delivery agent compound was converted to the sodium salt with one equivalent of sodium hydroxide. Typically, a solution of the delivery agent compound was prepared in water and stirred, adding one equivalent of sodium hydroxide (1.0 N) when making the sodium salt. This mixture was vortexed and placed in a sonicator (about 37° C.). The pH was adjusted to about 7.0 to 8.5 with aqueous NaOH. The mixture was vortexed to produce a uniform suspension or solution, also using sonication and heat if necessary. Additional NaOH was added, if necessary, to achieve uniform solubility, and the pH re-adjusted to about 7.0 to 8.5. The delivery agent compound solution was mixed with an IFN stock solution (about 22.0 to 27.5 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline) and diluting to the desired volume (usually 3.0 ml). The final delivery agent compound and IFN doses, and the dose volumes are listed below in Table 6.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0155">The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200-250 g were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing and again as needed to maintain anesthesia. A dosing group of five animals was administered one of the dosing solutions. An 11 cm Rusch 8 French catheter was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with a pipette tip. The syringe was filled with dosing solution by drawing the solution through the catheter, which was then wiped dry. The catheter was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the incisors. The dosing solution was administered by pressing the syringe plunger.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0156">Blood samples were collected serially from the tail artery, typically at time=0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes. Serum IFN concentrations were quantified using Cytoscreen Immunoassay Kit for human IFN-alpha (catalog # KHC4012 from Biosource International, Camarillo, Calif.). Previous studies indicated baseline values of about zero. Results from the animals in each group were averaged for each time point. The maximum of these averages (i.e., the mean peak serum IFN concentration) is reported below in Table 6.</p>
