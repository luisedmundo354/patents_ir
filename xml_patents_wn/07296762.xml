<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a food press and especially to a hand-held food press, such as a garlic press.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hand-held food presses, such as a garlic press, are well known in the art and typically comprise pivotally connected upper and lower handles. The lower handle is provided with a press chamber for receiving food items, such as a garlic clove. The upper handle is provided with a press foot that is positioned to engage the press chamber and crush the garlic clove when the upper and lower handles are rotated together. The bottom of the press chamber is provided with a pattern of holes that permit fluid and particles of crushed garlic to be ejected from the chamber. Alternatively, the bottom of the press chamber may be provided with a number of parallel blades for slicing the garlic clove, instead of a pattern of holes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Users are often forced to own separate tools for crushing or slicing garlic. In addition, separate implements must also be used for cleaning food particles or other debris trapped in the holes or between the blades of the press chamber. Thus, it is desirable to have a single food press that performs multiple functions, such as a combination of crushing and slicing functions, and that has a single implement for cleaning either the holes or blades of the press chamber.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present invention, which comprises a food press having an upper handle rotatably connected to a lower handle. First and second chambers are formed in the lower handle, and first and second feet are pivotally connected to the upper handle. When the upper and lower handles are rotated together, the first and second feet respectively engage the first and second chambers. The first chamber has a bottom with a plurality of holes forming a pattern and the second chamber has a plurality of blades. The first foot has a flat surface and the second foot has a plurality of ribs sized and shaped to be inserted between the blades in the second chamber. The ribs of the second foot extend beyond the blades of the second chamber when the upper and lower handles are rotated together.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an alternative embodiment, the upper handle has first and second ends with the first and second feet pivotally connected to the upper handle at the first end. A post is positioned on the upper handle at the second end. A cleaning piece is provided for cleaning the holes of the first chamber, the blades of the second chamber and the ribs of the second foot. The cleaning piece has an opening sized and shaped to receive the post for removably attaching the cleaning piece to the upper handle. The cleaning piece has a plurality of nubs and an edge. The nubs form a pattern corresponding to the pattern of holes in the first chamber, and are sized and shaped to fit within the holes. The edge is sized and shaped to be inserted between the blades of the second chamber and between the ribs of the second foot.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a further alternative embodiment, at least part of the second chamber is a separately formed unit, with the blades positioned in the separately formed unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another embodiment, a stop is positioned on said upper handle such that the second foot is aligned to engage the second chamber when the second foot rests against the stop.</p>

When a garlic clove or other food item is placed in press chamber <b>26</b> and handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are rotated together, the garlic clove is crushed between flat surface <b>64</b> of press foot <b>62</b> and bottom <b>30</b> of the press chamber, such that any crushed particles and extracted fluids are ejected through holes <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>, slicer bar <b>56</b> has a slicer foot <b>66</b> with a plurality of parallel ribs <b>68</b> separated by channels <b>70</b>. When upper and lower handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are rotated to the closed position, ribs <b>68</b> and channels <b>70</b> are sized and shaped such that blades <b>38</b> are received in the channels and the ribs are inserted between the blades. In a preferred embodiment, the height of the ribs <b>68</b> is greater than the height of blades <b>38</b>, such that when handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are in the closed position, ends <b>72</b> of the ribs extend approximately 1 mm beyond the blades, but do not extend beyond bottom <b>34</b> of slicer chamber <b>28</b>. When a garlic clove or other food item is placed in slicer chamber <b>28</b> and handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are rotated together, slicer foot <b>66</b> presses the garlic clove against blades <b>38</b> which cut the garlic clove into a number of slices. As blades <b>38</b> are received in channels <b>70</b>, ribs <b>68</b> push the cut slices from between the blades. When handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are rotated to the closed position, ends <b>72</b> of ribs <b>68</b> extend beyond blades <b>38</b> to ensure that the sliced garlic and any other matter is completely ejected from the blades.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment, a stop <b>74</b> is positioned in press end <b>20</b> of upper handle <b>12</b> to facilitate engagement and insertion of slicer bar <b>56</b> in slicer chamber <b>28</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> rotated partly together with press bar <b>54</b> engaged, but not fully inserted into press chamber <b>26</b>. Stop <b>74</b> is positioned adjacent slicer bar <b>56</b> and pin <b>60</b>. As handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are rotated together toward the closed position, gravity causes slicer bar <b>56</b> to pivot on pin <b>60</b> and come to rest against stop <b>74</b>, which is positioned to hold the slicer bar in alignment to engage slicer chamber <b>28</b>. Thus, there is no need for the user to manually align slicer bar <b>56</b> with slicer chamber <b>28</b> when handles <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are rotated to the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Food press <b>10</b> is provided with a separate cleaning piece <b>100</b> that is stored in grip end <b>16</b> of upper handle <b>12</b>.
