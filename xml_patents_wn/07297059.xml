<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to progressive gaming systems and methods and, more particularly, to progressive systems and methods having fractional awards.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Progressive gaming systems and methods are utilized by the gaming industry to increase revenues from play of casino games of chance and to offer excitement and incentive to players of such casino games of chance. It is recognized that gaming terminals linked in a progressive gaming system create more frequent jackpots, a greater rate of incrementing the progressive amount, and a greater visibility than possible with stand-alone casino games of chance. As a result, players react with increased coin-in. A typical so-called wide area progressive gaming system links multiple casinos and affords players in each casino a chance to win a large jackpot. The conventional term “coin-in” generically refers to the wager or bet made by a player in what ever form such as, but not limited to coin, bills, tickets, cards, credits, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A wide area progressive gaming system provides a central progressive controller in communication with casino games of chance (gaming terminals) located in dispersed physical sites such as, for example, in groups of gaming terminals (such as in “island” of gaming terminals under a large overhead display showing the progressive award values), at different casinos, and/or in different cities. A number of different topological configurations, communication networks, communication protocols, and gaming terminals are commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">All such conventional linked progressive systems and methods fund and award progressive jackpot(s) based under control of the progressive controller. Typically, the coin-in values from each gaming terminal, as played by players, are continuously monitored and the progressive controller contributes a percentage to the jackpot pool. For example, if a maximum bet of $3 (i.e., 3 dollars “coin-in”) at a gaming terminal qualifies the player for a chance to win the progressive jackpot, then the progressive controller receives this information and contributes a percentage such as 3% or 9 cents to the jackpot pool. The funding for the progressive jackpot pool typically includes a percentage of all coins-in. Hence, if a player bets $2 (i.e., not qualifying for the progressive), a 3% or 6 cent contribution to the progressive jackpot is still made. This function (called “funding”) continuously occurs with coin-in data obtained from all gaming terminals being played. Some systems provide levels of separate progressive awards from separate jackpot pools with each pool separately funded. All such separate pools are separately funded by a specified percentage of all coins-in. Progressive systems are designed to support a predetermined number of levels such as, for example eight, but the casino and/or manufacturer operating the systems can configure it for a suitable number within the predetermined number, can select the percentage contribution for each level, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The progressive controller receives the coin-in data from the gaming terminals and funds each separate progressive jackpot pool. When a progressive jackpot payoff event for a configured level occurs in a gaming terminal (i.e., a player playing the casino game of chance in the gaming terminal wins the progressive), the gaming terminal communicates the occurrence of the progressive event to the progressive controller. The controller informs the linked gaming terminals of the progressive win in typically a celebration mode, and then the progressive jackpot for that level is awarded. As this exhausts the jackpot pool for that level, it is restarted from a reset (or funded from a “seed” plus a reserve pool or the like) and the new jackpot value for the level is broadcast out to all progressive displays for the gaming terminals. The new progressive jackpot value for that level is simultaneously displayed at all gaming terminals. A progressive jackpot award in one level does not affect the jackpot values in the other levels as they are separate pools separately funded.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The progressive controller is responsible for all contributions, calculations, and sending out all new display information to the progressive displays. The gaming terminals do not have any of this control responsibility. Some gaming terminals display the broadcast progressive jackpot value. One advantage of performing all functions at the progressive controller is that it provides a secure, centralized controller and database. The progressive system monitors the coin-in meter at each gaming terminal and receives the occurrence of the progressive event as reported from the gaming terminal. The gaming terminal itself is generally “dumb” or “ignorant” of the progressive jackpot value being awarded as the game controller in the gaming terminal primarily operates the casino game of chance for the player. That is, although the progressive jackpot value is sent to the physical location of the gaming terminal (e.g., to a display within the slot machine), the slot machine controller that controls and operates the slot machine does not accept as input for game play or modify the broadcast progressive jackpot value. The gaming terminal, in some conventional systems, may receive the broadcast progressive jackpot value to display it and/or re-send the value back to the progressive controller when won.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In such conventional progressive systems, players playing the casino game of chance in the gaming terminals are sometimes disappointed. For example, if the gaming terminal has only one progressive jackpot payoff level for players placing a maximum wager (i.e., max coin-in), then any player placing less than maximum wager misses out on receiving the progressive jackpot when the qualifying event occurs in the casino game of chance. E.g., if the qualifying event is aligning four 7s on the payline, and if the player is eligible with a maximum bet of 3 coins, then a player aligning four 7s on the payline but wagering only 1 coin will instead receive a fixed prize (e.g., 1,000 coins) or alternatively be paid from a smaller progressive prize pool dedicated only to this wager of 1 coin-in. Hence, a need exists to eliminate such player disappointment and to further increase player participation and excitement by paying such players a fraction of the progressive jackpot. A further need exists to enable the gaming terminal to receive the progressive jackpot value when it is displayed simultaneously to all progressive displays and to determine such fractional payoffs independent of the progressive controller. A further need exists to communicate the award of such fractional value payoffs to the progressive controller so that the progressive controller can deduct such fractional awards from the progressive jackpot. As the progressive jackpot payoffs are based on separate jackpot pools in the progressive controller, a need exists to provide such fractional payoffs for the jackpot pool in each level. A further need exists to enhance game play at the game level, by taking as input the progressive jackpot value, and based upon specific rules of play, allowing the player to win a function of the progressive jackpot value as calculated by the game terminal. A further need exists to provide fractional progressive awards for a jackpot level.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention solves the aforesaid needs by providing a method for paying a progressive jackpot in a system having a progressive controller linked to groups of gaming terminals. In one aspect, the method of the present invention broadcasts a current progressive jackpot amount from the progressive controller into each of the linked gaming terminals in each of the groups. The player at one of the gaming terminals places a wager which is received by the gaming terminal to enable the player to play a casino game of chance resident therein. The gaming terminal using software incorporating the method of the present invention determines a fractional value based upon at least (1) the broadcast current progressive jackpot amount and (2) the received wager when a progressive event occurs in play of the casino game of chance. When the progressive event occurs during play of the casino game of chance, the determined progressive jackpot value is delivered from the gaming terminal back to the progressive controller. These determined fractional progressive jackpot amounts are less than the broadcast progressive jackpot amount and is based on a function of the received wager (or other function in the play of the casino game of chance). In the wager function embodiment, the player controls the fractional amount received by the value of the received wager which can range from a lowest value to a maximum value.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a second embodiment of the method of the present invention, fractional awards less than a broadcast progressive jackpot amount are made to the player of a slot machine linked in a progressive gaming system. The progressive system broadcasts the progressive jackpot value to be won by the player when a progressive event occurs in the play of the slot machine by the player. The player places a wager of U units on at least one payline of the slot machine having a maximum wager of M units. The placed wager is received by the slot machine. The player is then paid a fractional amount less than the broadcast progressive jackpot amount based on the wager of U units, where U is less than M and when the progressive event(s) occurs in the play of the slot machine. Other embodiments and variations of the methods of the present invention are discussed herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">1. Overview</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wide area progressive jackpot system <b>10</b> incorporating the methods of the present invention is shown. A progressive controller <b>2</b> is shown at a control location <b>20</b> communicating with groups <b>30</b> of gaming terminals (GT) <b>40</b> over a communication network <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term “gaming terminal” is used in its broadest sense to be synonymous with, but not limited to, gaming system, gaming device, gaming machine, etc. A gaming terminal can be, but not limited to, stand-alone, incorporated into another gaming terminal, etc. A gaming terminal can also be connected to, but not limited to, a network, the Internet, a progressive system, a telecommunications network, etc. It is to be appreciated that conventional gaming terminal <b>1200</b> designs are vigorous and encompass a wide variety of conventional designs to incorporate any number of conventional casino games of chance.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The progressive controller <b>2</b> can be any of a number of conventional progressive controllers modified according to the teachings of the present invention contained therein. One such conventional progressive controller <b>2</b> is available from Mikohn Gaming Corporation known as CASINOLINK Linked Progressive Jackpot System.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the control location <b>20</b> contains the progressive controller <b>2</b>, a database server <b>4</b>, and an operator/administrator workstation <b>6</b> in communication with an Ethernet <b>14</b>. The Ethernet <b>14</b> also connects to a router <b>8</b> which in turn is connected to a modem <b>12</b>. The functional block diagram for control location <b>20</b> is conventional except as modified with respect to the methods of the present invention. The functional block diagram is that for the aforesaid CASINOLINK system and it is to be expressly understood that a number of other functional system approaches could likewise be modified under the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The communication network <b>50</b> can be any conventional communication network utilizing any of a number of other conventional networks. This could include any hardwired, wireless, and/or telecommunication network including the Internet communicating with each group <b>30</b> of gaming terminals <b>40</b>. The communication network <b>50</b> could include conventional switches, modems, routers, telephone connections, T1 or DSL lines, external firewalls, etc. In one embodiment, the progressive controller <b>2</b> can be located in a given casino and hardwired through cabling <b>50</b> to each group <b>30</b> and each group <b>30</b> could be an island of gaming terminals <b>40</b> located at various locations in the casino. In another embodiment, the groups <b>30</b> can be located in different casinos, in different locations, etc. How the progressive controller <b>2</b> communicates with each group <b>30</b> is performed in many different conventional designs. The communication network <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is conventional.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each group <b>30</b> may comprise any number of gaming terminals <b>40</b> and the gaming terminals <b>40</b> may incorporate any suitable casino game of chance (with or without bonus games) such as a slot game, a video slot game, video poker, video keno, etc. The location of each group <b>30</b>, the number of gaming terminals <b>40</b>, and the nature of each individual casino game of chance in the gaming terminal <b>40</b> is a matter of design choice under the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each group <b>30</b>, in one embodiment, has a modem <b>16</b> connected to a router <b>18</b> which is connected to an Ethernet <b>19</b>. On the Ethernet <b>19</b> is the Input/Output controller <b>22</b> which is connected through a conventional RS-485 communication port <b>2</b> to the serial bus <b>25</b> which, in one embodiment, is a half-duplex serial bus <b>25</b>. An overhead display <b>28</b> is connected to the bus <b>25</b> as are interface cards <b>26</b>. These components provide two-way data communication between each interface card <b>26</b> and the communication network <b>50</b>. The functional components discussed above are found in the aforesaid CASINOLINK system and it is to be expressly understood that a number of other functional system approaches could likewise be modified under the teachings of the present invention as discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each gaming terminal <b>40</b> has an internal progressive display <b>60</b> and a gaming control (GC) <b>70</b>. In conventional progressive systems, the progressive controller <b>2</b> broadcasts through the communication network <b>50</b> into the displays <b>28</b> and <b>60</b> the current progressive jackpot value <b>80</b> that can be won in the progressive game. Each gaming terminal <b>40</b> in each group displays the same dollar value <b>80</b> based upon this simultaneous broadcast. The displays <b>28</b> and <b>60</b> in conventional systems displays conventional units of value in any denomination, currency, award designation, etc. In a conventional fashion, as each gaming terminal <b>40</b> is played, a portion of the wager (or bet) made by players is credited from the gaming terminal <b>40</b> back through the communication network <b>50</b> to the progressive controller <b>20</b>. This is usually accomplished by the interface <b>26</b> reading a coin-in meter at the gaming terminal <b>40</b>. Based upon the incoming contributions from each gaming terminal <b>40</b> that is played, the progressive controller <b>2</b> uploads through the communication network <b>50</b> to the displays <b>28</b> &amp; <b>60</b> the new progressive values <b>80</b>. The functional components discussed above are found in the aforesaid CASINOLINK system and it is to be expressly understood that a number of other functional system approaches could likewise be modified under the teachings of the present invention as discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Under the teachings of the present invention, each gaming terminal <b>40</b> in each group <b>30</b>, in addition to the conventional displaying <b>60</b> of the value <b>80</b>, has access <b>62</b> to the value <b>80</b>. Based on this access <b>62</b>, the game control <b>70</b> delivers to players of the gaming terminal <b>40</b> awards based upon the value <b>80</b>. In one embodiment, these are fractional progressive awards. As will be explained in the ensuing, when a fractional award is made by the game control <b>70</b> of the gaming terminal <b>40</b>, the award is delivered from the gaming terminal <b>40</b> responsible for the fractional progressive award over the communication network <b>50</b> into the progressive controller <b>2</b> which then modifies the current value of the progressive jackpot by subtracting the fractional progressive award made so that a new value <b>80</b> is broadcast into displays <b>28</b> and <b>60</b> to reflect an updated value. Of course, as this occurs, contributions may also be made to increase the progressive value <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A group <b>30</b> includes any desired number of gaming terminals GT<sub>N</sub>. A group <b>30</b> herein may include one gaming terminal, in which case, the modem may communicate directly with the gaming terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an overview of the method of the present invention is set forth. The progressive controller <b>2</b> in stage <b>200</b> continually computes and broadcasts a progressive value <b>80</b>. The progressive value <b>80</b> is delivered <b>210</b> through the communication network <b>50</b> to each of the groups <b>30</b>. The broadcast conventionally occurs continuously based upon coin-in contributions from all of the gaming terminals GT being played by players. Conventionally the broadcast value is displayed having a rolling odometer effect. Even though no gaming terminals are played at a group, the display continuously shows the current progressive jackpot amount <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In each gaming terminal <b>40</b> of each group the value <b>80</b> is displayed <b>220</b> in either or both the overhead display <b>28</b> and display <b>60</b>. Whether or not there are other displays of this value <b>80</b> in, at, or near the gaming terminal <b>40</b> is not material to the present invention. Game control <b>70</b>, under the teachings of the present invention, receives the value <b>80</b> for use in play <b>230</b> of the casino game of chance GC and for display <b>220</b> before, during, and/or after the play of the casino game of chance. A wager is received <b>230</b> from a player at the casino game of chance resident in the gaming terminal <b>40</b> being played. The fractional amount <b>90</b> based on the received wager and the broadcast current progressive jackpot amount <b>80</b> is determined <b>235</b> by software in the gaming terminal <b>40</b>. Such determination <b>235</b> can occur when the wager is received, at any time during the play of the casino game of chance, or when the progressive event occurs. When a progressive event occurs in the play <b>230</b> of the casino game of chance, the game control <b>70</b> determines <b>240</b> whether to award the full or a fractional portion of the progressive. If the progressive event does not occur, the play normally ends <b>250</b>. The term “progressive event” is whatever “event” is configured or designed into the casino game of chance. There exist a wide variety of “progressive events” available for casino games of chance linked together in a progressive system. Furthermore, in some progressive systems, different groups of gaming terminals may have different progressive events. Many “progressive events” are conventional and include, but are not limited to the random appearance of a predetermined game outcome such as three 7s or a hearts royal flush. The present invention works with any desired progressive event including conventional progressive events or progressive events designed for casino games not yet in existence. The determination of the fractional progressive award can occur in response to receiving the wager, during play of the casino game of chance and/or when the progressive event occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If the progressive event occurs during play <b>230</b>, then in stage <b>240</b> the award is made. The winning event is displayed <b>260</b> with the amount <b>90</b> to be awarded. The displaying <b>260</b> can occur to the player and/or to all gaming terminals in the group <b>30</b> and/or to all groups <b>30</b>. The amount <b>90</b> is then outputted <b>270</b> from the gaming terminal <b>40</b> through <b>280</b> the communication network <b>50</b> to the progressive controller <b>2</b>. Progressive controller <b>2</b> computes <b>200</b> a new progressive value by deducting the delivered award <b>90</b> as will be explained in greater detail later. The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> then repeats. What is not shown are the conventional steps involved with respect to the contribution based on the wager (coin-in) from each gaming terminal <b>40</b> played that is conventionally delivered to the progressive controller <b>20</b> through the communication network <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the various method steps incorporating the method of the present invention for the fractional awards of the present invention. It is to be expressly understood that some method steps can occur in different orders. For example, steps <b>260</b> and <b>270</b> can occur in parallel, in sequence or another fashion. A wide variety of communication protocols can be used between the progressive controller <b>2</b>, the communication network <b>50</b> and each gaming terminal <b>40</b> for each group <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention pertains to the gaming terminal <b>40</b> using the broadcast value <b>80</b> from the progressive controller <b>20</b> in the play <b>230</b> of the casino game of chance as by awarding <b>240</b> fractional progressive amounts <b>90</b> based on conventional progressive events occurring in the play <b>230</b>. Next, the present invention provides a return communication method from the gaming terminal <b>40</b> to the progressive controller <b>20</b> as represented by steps <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, and <b>280</b> to the progressive controller <b>2</b> wherein the fractional progressive award value <b>90</b> is delivered. In all conventional progressive controller systems play <b>230</b> of the casino game of chance never involves the determination and awarding of a fractional amount <b>90</b> of the broadcast progressive value <b>80</b> as determined automatically by the game control <b>70</b> in the gaming terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In summary of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the method of the present invention for paying a fractional progressive jackpot amount <b>90</b> in a system <b>10</b> having a progressive controller <b>2</b> linked to a plurality of gaming terminals <b>40</b> (such as in, but not limited to groups <b>30</b>) includes: broadcasting <b>210</b> a current progressive jackpot amount <b>80</b>, receiving <b>230</b> a wager for play of a casino game of chance from a player at one of the gaming terminals, determining <b>235</b> at the gaming terminal being played, based on the broadcast current progressive jackpot amount and the received wager at least one fractional progressive jackpot amount <b>90</b>, and then awarding <b>240</b> that amount <b>90</b> to the player. The awarded amount <b>90</b> is also delivered <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> to the progressive controller <b>200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is expressly understood that the functional block diagram gaming terminal <b>40</b> is represented in different functional descriptions with different components based upon gaming terminal design requirements and the like. Hence the functional blocks shown and their interconnection are meant to be illustrative and not limiting to the teachings of the present invention. Under the teachings of the present invention, the broadcast progressive value <b>80</b> delivered from the progressive controller <b>2</b> through the communication network <b>50</b> is delivered into the I/O <b>26</b> and stored in register <b>352</b> (or hardware of software buffer) for subsequent delivery to the computer <b>300</b> for the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The computer <b>300</b> accesses register <b>352</b> and downloads the progressive value <b>80</b>, in a suitable digital form or protocol, and displays the value <b>80</b> in display <b>60</b> (and/or game display <b>320</b>) and also stores the value <b>80</b> in a suitable memory location <b>312</b> of memory <b>310</b>. As will be explained later, the computer <b>300</b> through suitable software programming has access to the value <b>80</b> in the memory location <b>312</b> based upon progressive events occurring in the play of the casino game of chance. As the casino game of chance is displayed in game display <b>320</b> and played by a player, the computer <b>300</b> under software control can award, upon the occurrence of the progressive events, fractional portions of the value <b>80</b> from the memory location <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When a fractional portion of the value <b>80</b> award occurs in the play <b>230</b> of the casino game of chance, the computer under software control displays this award <b>90</b> in displays <b>60</b> and <b>320</b> (and may further display celebration of this winning event in celebration displays, multimedia, etc.) (not shown). When this occurs, the computer <b>300</b> under software control outputs the fractional amount <b>90</b> to the output register <b>354</b> (or hardware or software buffer) in I/O <b>26</b> for delivery to I/O controller <b>22</b> (and thence through <b>280</b> the communication network <b>50</b> to the progressive controller <b>20</b>). It is to be understood that I/O registers <b>352</b> and <b>254</b> are shown separate, but need not be so as any I/O interface could be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The calculations of the fractional amount <b>90</b> in the embodiment set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> can be modified to be performed in the interface <b>26</b> or the I/O controller <b>22</b> each of which typically includes a computer capable of numerical calculations. Or, performed in the progressive controller <b>2</b>. In such modified embodiments, the game terminals <b>40</b> report the progressive event (as is conventionally done) along with data necessary to determine the fractional amount <b>90</b> (such as coin-in information). In other modified embodiments, the numerical calculations can be shared. For example, the gaming terminal <b>40</b> could calculate a numerical percentage based on coin-in which would be delivered to another computer (e.g., interface <b>26</b>, I/O controller <b>22</b> and/or progressive controller <b>2</b>) for determining the fractional amount <b>90</b>. The methods discussed herein are conventionally programmed into the system <b>10</b> discussed above.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">3. Fractional Progressive Awards</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The following methods of the present invention accomplish the goal of allowing players to be eligible for a fractional portion <b>90</b> of the progressive jackpot <b>80</b> with, for example, less than maximum wagers (or other game function). In one embodiment, the progressive jackpot pay out is prorated according to the amount of the wager placed (coin-in) <b>340</b> by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Under a first embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the method awards a portion of progressive jackpot to a player who has qualified <b>700</b> such as with a wager of U units on a payline during play of a casino game of chance (such as a slot machine) in gaming terminal <b>40</b>. If in stage <b>710</b>, no progressive event occurs, the method is done <b>720</b>. If the progressive event occurs, then stage <b>730</b> is entered. If the maximum possible wager is M units on a payline for the casino game of chance, then the player is paid an amount (portion of the progressive jackpot) less than or equal to the product of the progressive jackpot payoff value <b>80</b> and the ratio of U to M. The minimum possible wager for the casino game of chance is L.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">By way of example for the first embodiment and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, assume five possible wagers in wager/award I/O <b>340</b> in the gaming terminal <b>40</b> for the casino game of chance: WA, WB, WC, WD, WE. The ratio of U/M is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The fractional progressive awards <b>90</b> are represented as a portion of the total progressive jackpot: PA, PB, PC, PD, PE, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in this example, the portions (P) selected are less than U/M and can be any predetermined values, selected for the system, that are no more than U/M. In one embodiment the proportion of the progressive jackpot won is based on the amount of the wager where WA&lt;WB&lt;WC&lt;WD&lt;WE. The preferred proportion of payoffs has ratios, R, of: P/W=PA/WA&lt;=PB/WB&lt;=PC/WC&lt;=PD/WD&lt;=PE/WE. When the portion award equals U/M, then the ratio, R, is constant and, in the case of this example P=U/M and R=0.2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> sets forth the fractional progressive payoffs in place for this example. By assigning, in this example, wagers W (coins), wherein WA=1, WB=2, WC=3, WD=4, &amp; WE=5, and ratios, R, wherein R=0.1&lt;=0.1&lt;=0.1&lt;=0.125&lt;=0.2, are obtained. In this manner, therefore, any player who wagers on the casino game of chance in the gaming terminal <b>40</b> is eligible for a fractional portion of the progressive jackpot, but those who wager more (in particular, those who wager 4 coins) receive a better “fractional value” in that the ratio of portion to wager is higher. The conventional progressive award is maintained when M=5 and the entire payoff occurs. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is based on a 5 coin maximum bet for a payline. The method of the present invention is adaptable to any bet configuration for a casino game of chance including, but not limited to, 2 coin, 3 coin, 4 coin, etc. casino games of chance. In a preferred embodiment, when the player places the wager or bet, but before the casino game of chance commences play, the progressive amount for which the player is potentially eligible for is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Several alternate embodiments exist for the first-stage (of one or more stages) of a base-game jackpot qualification means. In describing these alternatives, the following example of 5 trigger symbols on a jackpot-eligible payline as the winning combination is used. However, the method of the present invention is equally applicable with any other combination of symbols on a payline. The approach is applicable under many conditions, but by way of further example assume the casino game of chance is a 9-line, 45-coin game. Hence the maximum bet M per payline is 5 coins and the lowest bet L per payline is 1 coin. These embodiments are summarized in the following table for a multi-bet, multi-payline casino game of chance such as this example of a 5 coin, 9 payline game:</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first embodiment, as already described, allows the player to be eligible for a fractional portion <b>90</b> of the progressive jackpot amount <b>80</b> by wagering any amount U on any payline from L to M. To provide an incentive for the casino game of chance player to bet M, the payoff percentage P similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is used. For the example of betting up to 5 coins on each of 9 paylines, the ratio values R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are used for each payline. The term “eligible” is the amount of the progressive value capable of being won by a player. The term “qualifying” occurs when the player achieves a required outcome (to win) the progressive amount. Qualification may be more than one step under the teachings of the present invention. For example, a players places a one-coin wager and is eligible to win 10% of the progressive amount <b>80</b>. If during play of the underlying game of chance at the gaming terminal, the player) aligns five jackpot symbols, the player qualifies in a first step. In a second step of this example, the player is presented with a trivia question, and if the player correctly answers, the player qualifies and wins the fractional progressive amount <b>90</b> of 10% of the progressive amount <b>80</b>. The aforesaid example is only an example and any number of steps in qualifying could be used and what constitutes qualification is not limited to aligning symbols or answering trivia questions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a second embodiment, the player is eligible for at least a fractional portion <b>90</b> of the jackpot <b>80</b> provided the player has placed any bet on all paylines (rows 2 and 3 in the above table). In the example of 5 coins and 9 paylines, the player would have to wager U on all 9 paylines, but again, the player need not bet the maximum M (U=5) on all 9 paylines and need only bet L (U=1) on each of the 9 paylines. In this second embodiment, the progressive event for winning the progressive jackpot may be, e.g., the alignment of 5 common symbols on any one of the 9 paylines (row 2 in the above table) or it may be the alignment of 5 common symbols on a prescribed payline (e.g., the 9<sup>th </sup>payline)(row 3 in the above table). In this second embodiment, what is advantageous is that the player wagering on all 9 paylines is eligible to win a portion of the progressive jackpot even if not wagering the theoretical maximum M on each play. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for the row 2 and row 3 designs in the above table. If a player, bets U=2 coins on each of nine paylines and the progressive event of 5 common symbols appears on any payline (row 2 design in the above table) or on a prescribed payline (row 3 design in the above table), then the player receives 20% of the progressive jackpot value <b>80</b> as a fractional progressive award value <b>90</b>. If the progressive award <b>80</b> is $1,000,000, then the fractional amount <b>90</b> is $200,000.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As mentioned, the numerical calculations could, in modified embodiments of the present invention, be performed, either in whole or in part, in other processors found in the interface <b>26</b>, the I/O controller <b>22</b> and/or the progressive controller <b>2</b> (or elsewhere). For example and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the gaming terminal <b>40</b> could communicate the progressive event occurrence plus the percentage P to the I/O controller <b>22</b> which would then calculate the fractional value <b>90</b> as it would also have the progressive value <b>80</b>. Or, the percentage P could be delivered to the progressive controller which could perform the calculation. Many variations exist under the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one variation of the present invention, the progressive jackpot is won in two stages, the first stage comprises the aligning of traditional symbols on the base game (i.e., a predefined winning combination in the casino game of chance) and the second stage is a trivia (or strategy) game. First, the player must meet predefined criteria on the base game. This first step of qualification of a player is accomplished, e.g., by aligning 5 trigger symbols left to right on any active payline in a slot casino game of chance. The word “qualifying” is used in its broadest sense herein and is not limited to aligning 5 trigger symbols as it could be any predefined event in the game such as, for example, a random symbol appearance, a random coin-in occurrence, a predefined symbol outcome in combination with a prescribed wager and number of lines played, etc. Thereafter, as a second step of qualification, a trivia question is posed on-screen to the player. If the player is right in answering the trivia question, then the player has successfully completed both stages of qualification and therefore wins the progressive jackpot. If wrong on the trivia stage, then the player wins a consolation prize of 25% of the jackpot. In some embodiments, a two-stage process need not be used and in which case the traditional one-step means of qualifying on the base game is used as discussed above. Alternately, a multi-stage process could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an example of a progressive award <b>90</b> payoff for the progressive percentage portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is set forth for a progressive award <b>80</b> of $1,000,000 which is broadcast to all gaming terminals <b>40</b>. Assume, in this example, that a player places a wager of two coins per line in the above nine line casino game of chance example. In the event a progressive event is hit in the play of the game (e.g., three red 7s), the player, under the teachings of the present invention, would receive $200,000. In operation, with reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the game terminal <b>40</b> detects the presence of the progressive event and the two wagers per line which have been made by the player so in step <b>240</b> alerts the player to the fractional progressive award of $200,000 In such awards, it is conventional for the casino (or the owner of the gaming terminal) to verify the win and to pay the player usually by check. A display <b>260</b> is made to the player either in the onscreen display <b>320</b> or other suitable display <b>60</b> in the gaming terminal <b>40</b>. The fractional amount <b>90</b> (in this example, $200,000) is delivered <b>270</b> through the communication network <b>50</b> in step <b>280</b> to the progressive controller <b>2</b>. The progressive controller <b>2</b> is immediately made aware that gaming terminal <b>40</b> has a possible progressive award <b>90</b> to be made to the player. The progressive controller <b>2</b> (depending on the conventional progressive controller) usually enters a pending mode until verification of the win is made. It is to be expressly understood that in delivering the fractional amount <b>90</b> other suitable information such as the identification of the gaming terminal <b>40</b>, the time of the award, etc. can be delivered to the progressive controller <b>2</b>. Progressive controller <b>2</b> in step <b>200</b> deducts the award <b>90</b> from its current progressive award determination. At the time of this deduction, the progressive award <b>80</b> of $1,000,000 which was broadcast at a time prior to the win by the player at the gaming terminal <b>40</b> has increased through contributions. For example, assume the actual progressive jackpot at the time of the deduction is $1,000,099. The progressive controller <b>2</b> deducts $200,000 (i.e., 20%) from this amount and rebroadcasts the new progressive value <b>80</b> of $800,099.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In summary of the above embodiments based on receiving a wager, the method of the present invention includes: receiving a wager of U units from a player on at least one payline of the casino game of chance (e.g., a slot machine) wherein the maximum wager is M and paying the player an amount less than the progressive jackpot amount based on the wager of U units where U is less than M when the progressive event occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is expressly understood that the progressive controller <b>2</b> is preferably continually updating and increasing the value <b>80</b> based upon contributions from all of the gaming terminals being played. It is also to be understood that other gaming terminals <b>40</b> may award fractional portions <b>90</b> which may come in at the same time which would then have to be deducted. The progressive controller <b>2</b> has control over these deductions. The player at the winning gaming terminal <b>40</b> who won the $200,000, in this example, is paid that amount through conventional celebration and whatever the sponsoring casino desires to do.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one embodiment of the present invention for paying a player is set forth. The player places the wager <b>600</b> wherein the wager U, as set forth above, is a value between L and M. When the wager is received by the gaming terminal <b>40</b>, the computer <b>300</b> in the gaming terminal <b>40</b> can now actually display <b>605</b> in the game display <b>304</b> or other suitable display <b>60</b> not only the broadcast progressive value <b>80</b> but also the fractional value <b>90</b> that the player is actually entitled to based upon the wager amount. For example and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, if the player placed a wager of U=3 (e.g., $3.00) then based upon the amount of the actual wager the computer <b>300</b>, in software incorporating the method of the present invention, determines the fractional amount <b>90</b> of $300,000 based on the broadcast value <b>80</b> of $1,000,000, that the player is qualified to win in the progressive as determined by the gaming terminal <b>40</b>. This fractional amount is displayed <b>605</b> so that the player is fully informed of that award for that possible win. It is to be understood that both amounts <b>80</b> and <b>90</b> can be displayed and perhaps in a fashion encouraging the player to wager U=M for the next game. Or, only the fractional amount <b>90</b> could be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The player then plays a casino game of chance <b>610</b> and a determination is made in the gaming terminal <b>40</b> whether a progressive event occurs in step <b>620</b>. Whatever the progressive event is, and when it occurs, the gaming terminal <b>40</b> pays the player an amount less than or equal to the product of the progressive jackpot and the ratio of U to M in stage <b>630</b>. Likewise, when the progressive event occurs, a display <b>635</b> of the fractional amount being won is made. This can be accompanied by conventional celebration multimedia, etc. This display can occur in a game display <b>320</b> or other suitable displays <b>60</b> at the gaming terminal <b>40</b>. As explained above, this then is reported back to the progressive controller.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is to be expressly understood that this mathematical relationship represents one embodiment of the present invention. Any suitable mathematical relationship or, predetermined configuration by the casino operator of the present invention, could be utilized. For example, the casino operator would have the ability to select fractional progressive awards <b>90</b> based upon its own mathematical formulas and/or an arbitrary basis. For example, a casino in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may choose to have the following fixed fractional values <b>90</b> for a progressive event involving three red 7s: $77,777 (for U=1); $177,777 (for U=2); $277,777 (for U=3); and $577,777 (for U=4) whenever the broadcast progressive values go over $1,000,000. Of course, the maximum bet of U=M results in the standard progressive payoff <b>80</b> which would be greater than $1,000,000 in this example. The determination of the fractional payoff portion <b>90</b> for a player can mathematically be based such as by the algorithm expressed above or arbitrarily selected.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, it can be appreciated that steps <b>620</b> and <b>630</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are contained within step <b>240</b> and that steps <b>600</b> and <b>610</b> are found in step <b>230</b>. What is taught, under another embodiment of the present invention, is a method for paying a progressive jackpot in a progressive system with a central controller <b>2</b> linked to a number of gaming terminals <b>40</b>. In this method embodiment, the current progressive jackpot value <b>80</b> is broadcast <b>210</b> from the progressive controller <b>2</b> to each of the gaming terminals <b>40</b> as previously discussed. At each gaming terminal <b>40</b>, wagers are received <b>600</b>. The casino game of chance is played. When a progressive event is detected <b>620</b>, the player is paid <b>630</b> an award <b>90</b>. This award could be up to the maximum value broadcast or in this example $1,000,000 in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Determination of the progressive event <b>620</b> and the paying of the player <b>630</b> occurs at the gaming terminal <b>40</b> based upon the rules of play for that particular casino game of chance. Once the determination is made the award and is displayed <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the amount <b>90</b> is delivered <b>270</b> and <b>280</b> to the progressive controller <b>2</b> which recomputes <b>200</b> the new progressive value <b>80</b>. Under this embodiment, the method of the present invention for paying a progressive jackpot includes: broadcasting <b>210</b> the current progressive jackpot amount <b>80</b> from the progressive controller <b>2</b> to each of the gaming terminals <b>40</b>. It also includes receiving wagers <b>600</b> for the play of a casino game <b>610</b> in the gaming terminal <b>40</b>. It also includes determining at each gaming terminal wagered on based upon the rules of play (i.e., what is a “progressive event”) whether it has occurred and if it has, what the current broadcast progressive amount <b>80</b> is, the wager was received <b>600</b>, and what the at least one jackpot value <b>80</b> is won by the player. If the at least one progressive jackpot value has been won, under the teachings of the present invention, that amount <b>90</b> is delivered <b>270</b>, <b>280</b> back to the progressive controller <b>2</b> to compute a new progressive value <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The fractional award <b>90</b> can be determined based on function other than coin-in. Any suitable base game or bonus game function can be utilized. In one embodiment, U=M and the fractional amounts <b>90</b> are obtained when progressive events occur in a bonus round(s) of a bonus game to the base casino game of chance.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, if in a game with two-step qualifying procedure, the first step may be to align five YAHTZEE cups on a payline. If the chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is used and if the player wagered three coins, then in the first step the player has a potential fractional progressive win of 30%. Or if the progressive amount is $1,000,000 a fractional amount <b>90</b> of $300,000. The second step may be to require the player to play a YAHTZEE game. If the result of such play is a YAHTZEE of sixes (i.e., 5 sixes), then 100% of the potential progressive amount in step <b>1</b> may be awarded or $300,000. Any other YAHTZEE outcome (e.g., 5 threes) pays 30% of the potential progressive amount in step <b>1</b> or $90,000. The above example shows how vigorous the method of the present invention is. First, a plurality of steps can be utilized to qualify the player for the fractional progressive award. Each step can be based on a random casino game of chance outcome and/or based on player control of the outcome in a skill, strategy and/or knowledge casino game. Second, each step can provide a fractional portion of the prior step. In the above example, the first step provides a potential fractional progressive award of 30% (based on a three coin wager) and a second step of either 100% or 30% of the prior potential fractional award in step <b>1</b> (based on a game outcome).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It is to be understood that many variations are possible and that fractional awards could be greater than 100%. In another example of a broadcast progressive amount <b>80</b> of $1,000,000, a third step is added. The first step of this example the fractional potential award is based on wager and the occurrence of the progressive event (e.g., 5 symbols, 4 coin-in per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, 50% potential progressive award (or $500,000)). The second step is based on a successful random casino game outcome (e.g., YAHTZEE of 5 sixes) potentially pays 120% (or $600,000) of the potential award in Step <b>1</b>, any other YAHTZEE (i.e., 5 threes) potentially pays 100% of the potential award (or $500,000) in Step <b>1</b>, finally any other outcome for the five dice rolled results in 30% (or $90,000). In a variation, the player may be given an option to stop after any given step. In this example, if the player opts to proceed (or automatically proceeds) the third step may be a trivia question. If answered correctly the player receives 150% of the potential award in prior step (either $900,000, $750,000 or $135,000) if answered correctly or if answered incorrectly the player receives 75% (either $450,000, $375,000 or $67,500). All of this adds to player excitement in moving through the steps. Variations of the present invention based on this example would not go over the broadcast progressive amount <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As another example, a player wagering U=M may qualify in a single-step process on the base game as follows. With 5 banana slug symbols left to right on the 15<sup>th </sup>payline, the player wins 100% of the progressive amount. With 4 banana slug symbols left to right on the 9<sup>th </sup>payline, the player wins 5% of the progressive amount <b>80</b>. Alternatively, with 5 banana slug symbols left to right on any payline other than the 15<sup>th</sup>, the player wins 25% of the progressive amount.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Indeed, the awarding of less than the top award may be a function of game outcome (as described in the preceding paragraphs), the initiating wager, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The above disclosure sets forth a number of embodiments of the present invention. Those skilled in this art will however appreciate that other arrangements or embodiments, not precisely set forth, could be practiced under the teachings of the present invention.</p>
