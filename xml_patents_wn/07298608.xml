<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on and claims priority of Japanese patent applications No. 2004-249121 filed on Aug. 27, 2004, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal television including a cord binding hook, in a liquid crystal television which can be freely installed indoor as a stand type and a wall hanging type, which makes it possible to bind cords easily without damaging the connected cords even when a number of cords are connected to a back casing of the above described television where a number of input and output terminals are disposed to perform input and output to and from a plurality of kinds of external home electric devices and the like, and which is excellent in design and beauty by covering binding portions and the like of the cords connected to the above described terminals with an attachable and detachable cover member.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a method for holding and housing cords which are led out from electronic devices is utilized with a construction as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for a liquid crystal monitor or the like used for display of a personal computer. A pivoting support part <b>41</b> of a stand <b>43</b> which supports a casing <b>44</b> is in a center of a back surface of the casing <b>44</b>, and a recessed part <b>42</b>, which leads out and houses two signal cord <b>45</b> and power supply cord <b>48</b> which are connected to the above described computer body not shown while holding them, is provided in the above described casing back surface <b>44</b>A avoiding the pivoting support part <b>41</b>, a cord holding wall <b>47</b> is formed in the recessed part <b>42</b> to project from the above described recessed part <b>42</b>, and the above described cord holding wall <b>47</b> is provided with cord holding grooves <b>47</b>A formed by notches corresponding to the thickness of the cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> at two spots to hold the above described two cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> by fitting them in. Further, a cover member <b>46</b> including engaging means with the above described casing back surface <b>44</b>A is mounted to the above described recessed part <b>42</b>. On a back surface of the cover member <b>46</b>, projections <b>46</b>A which prevent the above described cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> from removing from the cord holding grooves <b>47</b>A are formed at positions opposed to the cord holding grooves <b>47</b>A provided in the above described recessed part <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Besides, as for another electronic device, for example, the following prior art is proposed. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-43766 (Patent Document 1) proposes a method for housing the power supply cord <b>48</b> by disposing a plurality of notches <b>54</b> for leading out the power supply cord <b>48</b> along a perimeter edge of the cover member <b>46</b> and winding the power supply cord <b>48</b> around a cord winding member <b>53</b> by its excessive length, in an electronic device <b>50</b> including a space <b>51</b> provided on a side surface of the electronic device <b>50</b> to which the power cord <b>48</b> is connected to house the power supply cord <b>48</b>, the cover member <b>46</b> supported to be attachable and detachable to and from the device <b>50</b> to open and close the space <b>51</b> and cord winding member <b>53</b> with projected parts of two projections each in an inverted L-shape formed on the back surface of the cover member <b>46</b> disposed with their backs facing each other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the prior art of the above described liquid crystal monitor used for the display of the personal computer, since the pivoting support part <b>41</b> of the stand <b>43</b> which supports the casing <b>44</b> is in the center on the back surface side of the above described casing <b>44</b>, and the recessed part <b>42</b> which leads out and holds the two signal cord <b>45</b> and the power supply cord <b>48</b> is provided on the above described casing back surface <b>44</b>A avoiding the pivoting support part <b>41</b>, the vacant space of the above described casing back surface <b>44</b>A is narrow, only one more recessed part <b>42</b> can be disposed at one spot on the left side of the casing back surface <b>44</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in which the stand pivoting support part <b>41</b> disposed in the center is therebetween even if it is desired to additionally dispose the same recessed parts <b>42</b> as described above on the casing back surface <b>44</b>A to bind a number of cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b>, and the number of held cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> which are actually two can be increased to only four, while one more of the above described cover member <b>46</b> needs to be added. As a result, the mounting operation of the above described cover member <b>46</b> increases. Besides, the cord holding wall <b>47</b> provided in the above described recessed part <b>42</b> is provided with the notches of the cord holding grooves <b>47</b>A at two spots to be able to fit and hold the above described two cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> therein, but it has to be said difficult to hold more than two cords in the same space. On the other hand, the holding wall <b>47</b>, which is provided in the above described recessed part <b>42</b>, is provided with the notches of the holding grooves <b>47</b>A corresponding to the thickness of the cords, and even if the position where the cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> are fitted and held is mistaken, the error can be easily found visually. Besides, the holding part for the above described cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> is in an almost sealed state by the above described cover member <b>46</b>, which can be said to be an advantageous structure for dust prevention. However, if there is no problem of the vacant space for forming the recessed part <b>42</b> as described above, and when, for example, more than ten are to be held by the similar holding means, if the notches corresponding to more than ten cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> which individually differ in thickness are to be prepared, assignment of a cord has to be performed for each of the holding grooves <b>47</b>A, and it has to be said that the operation is complicated. Besides, the structure is such that the cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> are held by the holding groove <b>47</b>A and the projection <b>46</b>A at the cover member <b>46</b> side, and when the cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> twist, the edge of the cover member <b>46</b> pinches the cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b>, whereby the cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> are crushed, and the burden on the cords <b>45</b> and <b>48</b> such as a damage and a break increases.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Besides, the cord winding member <b>53</b> in the above described Patent Document 1 is in the shape in which two of the projected parts of the projections <b>53</b> each in the inverted L-shape formed on the back surface of the cover member <b>46</b> which is detachably supported at the electronic device <b>50</b> are disposed with their backs facing each other, the back surface of the above described cover member <b>46</b> and the projected part of the above described projection <b>53</b> in the inverted L-shape form a flange part when the cord <b>48</b> is wound round, and it is excellent in winding easiness irrespective of the number of cords <b>48</b> to be wounded, but when a number of cords <b>48</b> are wounded and housed, the above described number of cords <b>48</b> are folded on each other to be wound, which is the cord winding structure extremely difficult in winding back a specific cord <b>48</b> by designating it after it is wound around and changing it to a desired length, and can be said to be unsuitable for the purpose of holding a plurality of cords <b>48</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has an object to realize a cord binding hook capable of easily and reliably binding cords as many as about 20 without damaging them to connect to external home electric devices and the like, in an electronic device such as a liquid crystal television, and to provide a liquid crystal television excellent in design and beauty without an unnatural force exerted on cords which are connected and led out by unifying dispositions of input and output terminals connected to a number of cords and a power supply cord to be downward to make orientation of the above described connected cords downward especially in the liquid crystal television, and by providing a detachable cover member which covers lead-out parts of the cords connected to the above described terminals which are disposed and bound by the above described cord binding hook.</p>
