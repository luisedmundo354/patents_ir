<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/564,373, filed 22 Apr. 2004. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a floor latch mechanism for securing a seat to the floor of a vehicle and, more particularly, to an improved latch mechanism for releasably connecting a seat to the floor of the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automotive floor latch seat mechanisms are well known in the industry and they employ a variety of designs. These mechanisms connect the lower portion of an automotive seat to the floor of the vehicle. Early mechanisms permanently mounted the seat to the floor of the vehicle, thus, making it impossible for the occupant to move, adjust, or even remove the seat. However, the automotive market has evolved to provide greater flexibility and seat maneuverability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been desirable to improve upon conventional seat mechanisms so as to allow the seat to move for a variety of purposes. For example, it is beneficial to allow a second row seat to move up and out of the way so as to allow an occupant to access a third row of seats in the rear of the vehicle. It has also been desirable to provide releasable floor latch mechanisms so as to allow the seat to be entirely removed from the vehicle. This adds increased cargo space in the interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional adjustable floor latch mechanisms are complicated and they often utilize numerous interworking components so as to accomplish the desired releasing feature. These prior art mechanisms often require complex assemblies utilizing multiple specially stamped parts and springs that have a tendency to fail. While some of these floor latch mechanism assemblies have been successful, they have increasing problems of reliability, are expensive due to their complex design, and add weight to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is desirable to provide an improved floor latch mechanism assembly that minimizes the number of components and hence, cost of the assembly. It is also desirable to provide an assembly that weighs less. It is further desirable to provide an improved floor latch mechanism assembly that has an improved locking mechanism for securing the seat to the floor. Further, it is desirable to provide an improved floor latch mechanism assembly that is easier for the operator to operate. It also is desirable to provide a latch assembly that is universal in its design so as to be utilized in other applications where it is desirable to latch a component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To accomplish these and other objects, the present invention provides a floor latch mechanism assembly for removably securing a seat to a floor of a vehicle. The assembly includes a mounting bracket having an upper flange that is mountable to the underside of a seat, with a side flange extending at a right angle from the upper flange. A latch hook is disposed adjacent to the mounting bracket, and is pivotally connected to the mounting bracket by a first pivot pin. A cam lock hook is provided that interfaces with the latch hook and they work in concert with one another so as to provide a locking feature with the striking pin that is secured to the floor of the vehicle. A second pivot pin extends through the cam lock hook and is in turn staked to the mounting bracket. A spring is positioned between the second pivot pin and the cam lock hook so as to engage the cam lock hook to the latch hook. An anti-separation device maintains the cam lock hook and the latch hook in alignment so as to add integrity to the locking feature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided herein. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the present invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It will be appreciated that the present invention can be utilized in automotive, airplane, train, and any other application where it is desirable to releasably connect a component.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The mounting bracket <b>36</b> includes an upper flange <b>48</b> and a side flange extending approximately perpendicular to the upper flange. It will be appreciated that the bracket <b>36</b> could be integral with the seat <b>12</b>. The upper flange has a pair of mounting holes <b>52</b> that receive fasteners <b>26</b> for securing the mounting bracket to the underside of the seat cushion <b>16</b>. During the stamping process a tab <b>54</b> is formed extending outwardly from a forward edge of the side flange <b>50</b> and a release cable attachment hole <b>56</b> is located therethrough and provides a mounting means for the release cable to be secured thereto. It will be appreciated that the release cable <b>104</b> can be secured to the mounting bracket <b>36</b> at other locations as long as it affords the desired travel to the latch hook <b>40</b>. During the stamping process an anti-separation device or guide <b>58</b> is formed and is offset from the normal surface <b>60</b> that forms the side flange. The guide <b>58</b> is offset a sufficient distance so as to allow clearance for the width of latch hook <b>38</b> to be guided therein. The guide <b>58</b> maintains alignment of the latch hook <b>38</b> and the cam lock hook <b>40</b>. This prevents axial separation when under load and assures the integrity of the lock feature. The anti-separation device could be a separate component that is attached to the bracket <b>36</b>. A pair of holes <b>62</b> are pierced through the side flange <b>50</b> and they each have an emboss <b>64</b> and <b>64</b>′ for receiving their own pivot pin. A corresponding emboss <b>70</b> of the latch hook <b>38</b> mates with emboss <b>64</b>′ so as to sustain transfer of force between the mounting bracket <b>36</b> and latch hook <b>38</b>. The configuration between these embosses maintains greater load capacity at their connection. A recess <b>66</b> is located at a lower end of the side flange <b>50</b> and is operable to receive the striker bar <b>32</b>. A cut out <b>67</b> provides clearance for the spring <b>44</b>. An anti-rattle insulator <b>65</b> can be inserted within cut out <b>67</b>. The purpose of which is to minimize noise generated between the striker and the mounting bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The latch hook <b>38</b> has an offset hole <b>68</b> extending thereto with a boss <b>70</b> for receiving the pivot pin <b>42</b>. The upper portion of the latch hook <b>38</b> has a notched area <b>72</b> with a first shoulder <b>74</b> and a second shoulder <b>76</b>. A striker pin recess area <b>78</b> is enlarged to receive the striker bar <b>32</b>. The pivot pin <b>42</b> extends through the hole <b>68</b> of the latch hook <b>38</b> and then into the pivot hole <b>62</b>. An end <b>80</b> of the pivot pin <b>42</b> is then deformed so as to pivotally secure the latch hook to the mounting bracket <b>36</b>. The latch hook <b>38</b> yet is sufficiently loose fit to allow it to freely pivot and to be guided within guide <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>, the lock hook <b>40</b> has an anti-rattle component and a locking cam component and a release cable component. The cam lock hook <b>40</b> is unitary piece with an offset configuration so as to receive the spring <b>44</b>. The cam lock hook <b>40</b> has an offset hole <b>82</b> with an emboss <b>84</b>. Emboss <b>84</b> mates with emboss <b>64</b> to sustain the transfer of force between the mounting bracket <b>36</b> and the cam lock hook <b>40</b>. The embosses can be of a flat configuration as illustrated or conic shaped. A means for receiving an actuating device is provided. This includes a first arm <b>86</b> or cable component which is offset from the hole <b>82</b> and the outer end of the first arm <b>86</b> has a release cable “attachment” hole <b>88</b>. Opposing the first arm <b>86</b> is a second arm <b>90</b> a locking cam component that is operable to engage the recess <b>72</b> that is located in the latch hook <b>38</b>. When the floor latch mechanism assembly <b>10</b> is in its secured position whereby the seat <b>12</b> is locked in place, the forward edge <b>92</b> of the second arm engages shoulder <b>74</b> whereby they are locked in place because of the force exerted by spring <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cam lock hook <b>40</b> further includes a J-shaped hook member <b>94</b> or anti-rattle component that extends downwardly from hole <b>82</b> and is in surrounding engagement with the striker bar <b>32</b>. The surface <b>103</b> of the hook member <b>94</b> contacts the bottom side of the striker <b>32</b>. The center point of the radius of surface <b>103</b> is offset from the center point of hole <b>82</b>. This creates a tapered relationship as the hook contacts the striker and provides a tight fit to the striker in the event of either positional variation of the striker or diameter size variation of the striker. This prevents any clearance between the latch <b>38</b> and the striker that would result in a loose fit that could generate a rattle. The cam lock hook <b>40</b> serves the dual purpose of a locking device for securing the latch <b>38</b> and to engage the striker.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The hook member <b>94</b> is further designed in a fashion utilizing the applied steel grade, steel gage and design cross-section to allow for controlled deformation in this area of the part. This controlled variation allows the striker to contact the latch hook <b>38</b> to increase the applied force capacity at this interface. Prior to the deformation of the cam lock hook <b>40</b>, there is designed clearance between the striker and the latch hook <b>38</b>. The controlled deformation also creates additional force in the clockwise rotation of the cam lock hook <b>40</b> to maintain engagement of edge <b>92</b> and shoulder <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cam lock hook pivot pin <b>46</b> extends through the spring <b>44</b>, through the hole <b>82</b> of the cam lock hook and then through the hole <b>62</b> of the mounting bracket. The end <b>96</b> of the pivot pin <b>46</b> is deformed against the backside of the flange <b>50</b> so as to cause locking engagement thereto. However, the pivot pin <b>46</b> allows the cam lock hook <b>40</b> to freely rotate relative to the mounting bracket <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cam lock hook spring <b>44</b> is centered on the pivot pin <b>46</b> and at one end <b>98</b>, it wraps around the first arm <b>86</b> of the cam lock hook, and at the opposite end <b>100</b>, the spring impinges upon the recess surface <b>102</b> of the latch hook <b>38</b>. The spring <b>44</b> is a conventional torsional tempered spring, but could be other spring types as long as they provide the necessary required spring force.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The operation of the present invention will now be presented. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the assembly <b>10</b> is shown in an engaged and a disengaged position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the assembly in its latched position whereby the latch hook <b>38</b> and the cam lock hook <b>40</b> are secured to the striker pin <b>32</b>. It will be appreciated that a single striker pin could be used that extends the entire width of the seat, thus, alleviating the need for two separate strike assemblies <b>28</b>. In the engaged position, the mounting bracket <b>36</b> is positioned so that striker pin is within recess <b>66</b>. The latch hook <b>38</b> simultaneously makes contact with the striker pin <b>32</b>, causing the latch hook <b>38</b> to rotate in a clockwise direction where the recess <b>78</b> fully engages the striker pin. As the latch hook <b>38</b> rotates clockwise, the second arm <b>90</b> of the cam lock hook <b>40</b> rotates clockwise once shoulder <b>74</b> has cleared edge <b>92</b> of the cam lock hook <b>40</b>. The applied force from spring <b>44</b> automatically rotates the cam lock hook clockwise so as to allow the hook <b>94</b> to fully engage the striker pin <b>32</b>. Once this occurs, a locking mechanism is created between the latch hook <b>38</b>, the cam lock hook <b>40</b>, and the guide <b>58</b> which holds the two later parts from moving axially. The guide prevents the latch hook <b>38</b> and the cam lock hook <b>40</b> from separating when under load. Collectively, this locking means maintains the seat in its locked position, until the release cable is pulled.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the method of disengaging the assembly will now be presented. To disengage the floor latch assembly <b>10</b> from the striker pin <b>32</b>, the operator pulls the release cable <b>104</b>, thus causing the cam lock hook <b>40</b> to rotate counter-clockwise. This causes second arm <b>90</b> to shift upward within the guide <b>58</b> and to disengage from recess <b>72</b>. The torsional force applied by spring <b>44</b> against the latch hook <b>38</b> then causes the latch hook <b>38</b> to rotate counter-clockwise so as to allow full disengagement of recess <b>78</b> from the striker pin <b>32</b>. The seat <b>12</b> can now be moved upward and away from the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the operator releases cable <b>104</b>, the latch assembly <b>10</b> will remain in a disengaged state. Re-engagement of the striker <b>32</b> to the latch mechanism <b>10</b> is facilitated by the striker contacting the latch hook <b>40</b> along the trim surface <b>105</b> causing the latch hook to rotate clockwise into a locked relationship with the cam lock hook between arm <b>92</b> and shoulder <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
