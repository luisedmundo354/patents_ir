<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject invention relates to cleaning and pretreatment of product surfaces for preparing the product surface for a coating application. More specifically, the subject invention relates to cleaning a product surface with a cleaning agent, phosphate, or other conversion coating for paint application.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pretreatment refers to the treatment of plastic or metallic surfaces such as automobile parts and preparation for subsequent application of a coating to the part. For example, a metallic surface for an automobile body is prepared for subsequent application of electrodeposition paint via an electrodeposition paint tank. Plastic components have also been known to have a surface treatment in a pretreatment system prior to the application of a primer or decorative coating.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical metallic vehicle body arrives at a pretreatment apparatus covered with metal forming oils, grinding dust, and other environmental contaminants. These contaminants must be removed to apply a defect-free phosphate coating to prepare the metallic surface to receive corrosion resistance and decorative coatings. Pretreatment includes a series of surface cleaning stages followed by phosphating, or the application of a conversion coating. Zinc phosphate is the principal conversion coating used in the automobile industry today, although iron phosphate is widely used in other applications. The pretreatment process includes a series of steps designed to remove contaminants from the metal surface, convert the surface to an inorganic crystalline coating, and seal the crystalline structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One example of an immersion zinc phosphate system includes nine stages: Spray cleaner, immersion cleaner, spray rinse, immersion conditioner rinse, immersion zinc phosphate, immersion rinse, immersion chromic acid rinse, immersion recirculated deionized water rinse, and a spray virgin deionized water rinse. The first two stages, the spray cleaner and immersion cleaner stages, clean the surface of contaminants to prepare the surface to form a tight, adherent, fine grained zinc phosphate coating. Absent a clean surface, the first layer of paint, commonly referred to as an electrodeposition coating, will not adhere properly resulting in paint defects projecting through the top coat or premature corrosion of the metallic surface. The third stage, the spray rinse stage, follows cleaning and rinses the cleaning solution from the metallic surface. Failure to rinse the cleaning solution results in contamination of subsequent chemical treatment stages. The immersion conditioner rinse stage, stage four, increases the nucleation sites on the metallic surface, thereby reducing the amount of zinc phosphate required to coat the surface and improve conversion coating uniformity. The immersion zinc phosphate stage, stage five, applies phosphate crystals to the metal surface, giving the surface corrosion-inhibiting properties and providing an improved base for paint application. Stage six, the immersion rinse, rids the surface of compounds from the zinc phosphate stage that could contaminate stage seven, the immersion chromic rinse stage. The chromic acid rinse removes remaining water soluble compounds from the surface to maximize corrosion protection. While the chromic acid rinse stage is not essential to the phosphating process, corrosion resistance of many substrates has proven to be greatly enhanced by the use of chromic acid. The last two stages, the recirculated deionized water rinse and the spray virgin deionized water rinse, remove all phosphate residue from the surface so as to not contaminate the electrodeposition primer tank.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first stage uses a series of spray nozzles or other applicators to spray the metal surface and remove contaminants through impingement and chemical cleaning. A typical cleaning chemical includes a caustic base and surfactant content. A tank having, for example, a 30,000 gallon capacity receives run-off from the spray as well as contaminants that are rinsed from the metallic surface. Oils removed from the surface are removed from the tank and transferred to a treatment process. Solution used in the process is recirculated and re-enters the process through the spray nozzles or other applicators.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The contaminants removed from the spray stage collect inside the tank and deplete the cleaning chemicals. Grinding dust and other solid contaminants are known to collect at the bottom of the tank. To clean the tank, the tank is drained and the contaminants are removed from the bottom of the tank. To maintain an optimum chemical content, cleaning occurs approximately every two weeks. Otherwise, the contaminants collect in the tank and deplete the chemical cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further problem results when the contaminants collect in the tank close to the spray nozzle inlet that provide the cleaning solution to the spray nozzles. If these contaminants are not allowed to settle to the floor of the tank, they can be drawn into the spray nozzle inlet. These contaminants are known to plug up the inlet, collect in the spray nozzles, and foul the pumps that pump the solution at a desired impingement pressure from the tank to the spray nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system that decreases the collection of contaminants inside the first stage proximate to the nozzle inlet resulting in less frequent cleaning of the tank and spray nozzles and increased efficiency of the cleaning stages of the pretreatment process.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The subject invention provides a spray clean stage of a pretreatment system for treating a product surface having contaminants. A tank holds a cleaning solution for cleaning product surfaces. A solution applicator is in fluid communication with the tank to an applicator inlet. The solution applicator is oriented to spray the solution onto the product surface to remove the contaminants from the product surface. A partition at least partially covers the tank to receive run-off of the solution from the product surface being sprayed with the solution. The partition is oriented to direct the run-off of the solution from the product surface into the tank at a location that is spaced from the applicator inlet to distance the contaminants removed from the product surface from the applicator inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Several benefits are derived by directing the contaminants removed from the product surface into the tank at a spaced location from the applicator inlet. For example, because the contaminants are typically more dense than the cleaning solution, the contaminants settle into the solution disposed in the tank. If the contaminants do not settle prior to being drawn into the applicator inlet, the applicators and pumps can become fouled as stated above. Upon directing the contaminants removed from the product surfaces to an area of the tank spaced from the applicator inlet, the contaminants are allowed time to settle in the tank before the solution is drawn into the applicator inlet. This provides the desired result of reducing the amount of maintenance needed to be performed on the applicators and the pumps. Further, contaminants that have settled reducing the probability of being drawn into the applicator inlet will not be applied to subsequent product surfaces by the applicators.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an inventive spray clean stage of a pretreatment process is generally shown at <b>10</b>. The spray stage is the first stage of the pretreatment process and is generally regarded as the sacrificial cleaning stage. The spray stage can be used to clean either metallic substrates or plastic substrates in preparation for providing a conversion coating in the case of a metallic substrate or a primer coating in the case of a plastic. For the purposes of this application, the pretreatment of a metallic substrate will be referred to, but it should be understood that the inventive spray clean stage <b>10</b> may be used for either metallic or plastic substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A metal substrate or product surface <b>12</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a vehicle body, is moved through the spray clean stage <b>10</b> suspended over a tank <b>14</b> via a conveyor system (not shown). The tank <b>14</b> holds a cleaning solution <b>16</b> that is applied to the product surface <b>12</b> under pressure through solution applicators <b>18</b>, such as, for example, spray nozzles or water jets. The cleaning solution <b>16</b> is maintained within a narrow pH and temperature range known to optimize the chemical cleaning of the product surface <b>12</b>. Therefore, the product surface <b>12</b> is cleaned by both impingement and by chemical dissolution of contaminants disposed upon the product surface <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The solution applicators <b>18</b> are in fluid communication with the tank <b>14</b> through an applicator inlet <b>52</b> as will be explained further below. The applicators <b>18</b> are oriented to spray the solution <b>16</b> onto the product surface to remove the contaminants. The solution <b>16</b> runs off the metal substrate <b>12</b> as indicated by narrows <b>19</b> carrying with it various particulate waste materials and contaminants as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A partition <b>22</b> at least partially covers the tank <b>14</b> and receives run-off of the solution <b>16</b> as indicated by arrows <b>19</b> from the product surface <b>12</b> being sprayed with the solution <b>16</b>. The partition <b>22</b> is oriented to direct the run-off of the solution <b>16</b> from the product surface <b>12</b> into the tank <b>14</b> at a location spaced from the applicator inlet <b>52</b> to distance the contaminants being removed from the product surface <b>12</b> from the applicator inlet <b>52</b>. Therefore, the contaminants removed from the product surface <b>12</b> can settle in the tank at a location distanced from the applicator inlet <b>52</b> reducing the probability that the contaminants can be drawn into the applicator inlet <b>52</b> plugging the applicators <b>18</b> or being reapplied to the product surface <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The tank <b>14</b> includes a floor <b>24</b> upon which the contaminants can settle. The floor includes a first level <b>24</b><i>f </i>positioned generally adjacent the applicator inlet <b>52</b> and a second level <b>24</b><i>r </i>positioned generally beneath the location spaced from the applicator inlet <b>52</b>. Preferably, the first level <b>24</b><i>f </i>includes a height less than the second level <b>24</b><i>r </i>the purpose of which will become more evident as described below. Preferably, the tank <b>14</b> includes a rearward end <b>25</b> and a forward end <b>29</b>. The applicator inlet <b>52</b> is disposed in the forward end <b>29</b> of the tank <b>14</b>. The location spaced from the applicator inlet <b>52</b> is preferably located near the rearward end <b>25</b> of the tank <b>14</b>. However, this configuration may be reversed if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A first pump <b>28</b> continuously pumps the solution <b>16</b> and contaminants through a filtration line <b>30</b> located adjacent the first level <b>24</b><i>f </i>of the floor <b>24</b>. The filtration line <b>30</b> carries the solution <b>16</b> and contaminants toward a vacuum filter generally indicated at <b>32</b>. While a vacuum filter <b>32</b> is preferable, other filters as known to those of skill in the art may also be used. The vacuum filter <b>32</b> includes media paper <b>34</b> on a roller <b>36</b> and a pressure sensor (not shown). As the mixture of solution <b>16</b> and contaminants pass through the media paper <b>34</b>, the contaminants are filtered from the solution <b>16</b> as is known to those of skill in the art. When a critical amount of contaminants <b>20</b> are built up on the media paper <b>34</b>, a vacuum is established below the paper <b>34</b> and the pressure sensor triggers movement of the exposed media paper <b>34</b> into a collection bin <b>38</b> by rolling new media paper <b>34</b> into place. Other types of filters and indexing apparatus may be used to filter the solution <b>16</b> as would be appreciated by those of skill in the art. Filtered solution <b>16</b> is returned the tank <b>14</b> from the vacuum filter <b>32</b> via solution return line <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A weir <b>42</b> is optionally disposed in the tank <b>14</b> to allow metal forming oil or other lubricants that collect on top of the solution <b>16</b> to drain. A drain line <b>44</b> is fluidly connected to the weir <b>42</b> to allow the oils or other floating contaminants to drain from the tank. When the circulation pumps are running and solution <b>16</b> is distributed throughout the spray lines and headers of the tank <b>14</b>, the solution <b>16</b> level is preferably below the weir <b>42</b> and does not spill into the weir drain line <b>44</b> from the tank <b>14</b>. When the circulation pumps are off, the spray lines and headers drain into the tank <b>14</b> raising the solution level above the weir <b>42</b> allowing the upper level of the solution, which is where oil typically collects, to drain. However, it may be desirable to balance the solution <b>16</b> level to flow continuously into the weir drain line <b>44</b> during production.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A second pump <b>46</b> draws the solution <b>16</b> through the applicator inlet <b>52</b> and pumps the solution <b>16</b> through a filter <b>48</b> and subsequently through a heat exchanger <b>50</b> to maintain the solution at an optimum temperature. The filtered solution <b>16</b> is then transferred to the applicators <b>18</b> under pressure through feed line <b>54</b> or to circulation nozzles <b>56</b> disposed beneath the solution <b>16</b> in the tank <b>14</b> via return line <b>58</b>. Prior to production, the solution <b>16</b> is circulated only through the circulation nozzles <b>56</b> to filter and heat the solution <b>16</b>. During production, the solution <b>16</b> is circulated preferably through the applicators <b>18</b> and not through the circulation nozzles <b>56</b> so that the contaminants removed from the product surface <b>12</b> can settle upon the floor <b>24</b> of the tank <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The tank <b>14</b> and the partition <b>22</b> define an opening <b>60</b> spaced from the applicator inlet <b>52</b> providing an ingress for run-off of the solution <b>16</b> from the product surface <b>12</b> to return to the tank <b>14</b>. Preferably, the opening <b>60</b> is positioned at an opposite end of the tank <b>14</b> from the applicator inlet <b>52</b>. The partition <b>22</b> slopes downwardly toward the opening <b>60</b> defined by the partition <b>22</b> and the tank <b>14</b> to facilitate the flow of solution <b>16</b> through the opening <b>60</b> and into the tank <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The partition <b>22</b> preferably defines at least one access <b>62</b> as is best represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The access <b>62</b> is covered by a lid <b>64</b> during production to prevent the run-off of the solution <b>16</b> from entering the tank <b>14</b> at an undesirable location. During maintenance, the lids <b>64</b> are easily removed to provide an access for maintenance equipment required to clean the tank <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The opening <b>60</b> is sized to receive the run-off of solution <b>16</b> without causing the solution <b>16</b> to puddle above the tank <b>14</b>. As stated above, the solution <b>16</b> drains from the vehicle body in the direction of arrows <b>19</b> and subsequently through the opening <b>60</b> and into the tank <b>14</b>. During production, the solid contaminants will settle on the rear floor <b>27</b> near the first level <b>27</b><i>r </i>of the tank <b>14</b>. The floor <b>27</b> angles downwardly from the opening toward the filtration line <b>30</b> located adjacent the first level <b>24</b><i>f </i>of the floor <b>24</b>. An alternate embodiment of the inventive spray clean stage is generally shown at <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Like elements to the first embodiment are represented in a hundred series of numerals to the elements in the first embodiment. A hopper <b>126</b> extends downwardly from the floor <b>124</b> of the tank <b>114</b>. The hopper <b>126</b> is preferably located generally closer to the first level <b>124</b><i>f </i>than to the second level <b>124</b><i>r</i>. Both the first level <b>124</b><i>f </i>and the second level <b>124</b><i>r </i>slope downwardly toward the hopper <b>126</b>. In this embodiment, the first level <b>124</b><i>f </i>is preferably positioned above the second level <b>124</b><i>r</i>. Contaminants represented by <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> settle at the bottom of the hopper <b>126</b> and are pulled by first pump <b>128</b> from the tank <b>114</b> for filtration as described in the first embodiment. A hopper grating <b>166</b> covers the hopper <b>126</b> to prevent large contaminants such as, for example, gloves or garbage from fouling the filtration line <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A baffle <b>168</b> extends downwardly above the hopper <b>126</b> to direct contaminants <b>120</b> suspended in the solution <b>116</b> into the hopper <b>126</b>. A screen <b>170</b> shields the applicator inlet <b>152</b> from any large contaminants that may be drawn into the applicator inlet <b>152</b> by the second pump <b>146</b>. The baffle <b>168</b> is positioned generally between the screen <b>170</b> and the opening <b>160</b> defined by the partition <b>122</b> and the tank <b>114</b>. The forward floor <b>124</b><i>f </i>is positioned above the level of the rearward floor <b>124</b><i>r </i>to further prevent the contaminants <b>120</b> from reaching the screen <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the inventive spray clean stage <b>10</b> having a first section <b>72</b> separated from a second section <b>74</b> by the partition <b>22</b>. The first section <b>72</b> is generally larger than the second section <b>74</b> and funnels run-off of the solution <b>16</b> through the opening <b>60</b> defined by the partition <b>22</b> and the tank <b>14</b>. A grating <b>76</b> provides a support floor above the partition <b>22</b> to support loads such as, for example, maintenance workers, above the partition <b>22</b>. As should be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the solution <b>16</b> flows freely through the grating <b>76</b> onto the partition <b>22</b> and through the opening <b>60</b>. A ladder <b>78</b> provides access for maintenance workers to climb into the second section <b>74</b> to perform maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a perspective view of the inventive spray clean stage <b>10</b> without the grating <b>76</b>. As represented, an axis <b>62</b> is positioned generally above the applicator inlet <b>52</b>. First stage ladders <b>80</b> are optionally included to provide access for maintenance workers to enter the first stage <b>72</b>. Support handles <b>84</b> may also be affixed to a wall of the first section <b>72</b> above the opening <b>60</b> to support a maintenance worker descending into the second section <b>74</b>.</p>
