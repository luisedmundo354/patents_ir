<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a clock buffer circuit. More specifically, the invention relates to a circuit capable of setting the voltage gain of the clock buffer circuit to be constant with respect to a variation of resistance elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">SCL (Source Coupled Logic) circuits are known as a kind of current mode logic circuits capable of performing low-amplitude and high-speed operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the clock buffer circuit that employs a conventional SCL circuit. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, NMOS transistors MN<b>1</b> and MN<b>2</b> are transistors that constitute a differential stage. Load resistances R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> are connected to the drain electrodes of these transistors and a VDD power supply, respectively. An NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b> is connected between the source electrodes of the NMOS transistors MN<b>1</b> and MN<b>2</b> and a VSS power supply. An NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b> and a resistance R<b>3</b> constitute a bias current. The drain electrode of the NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b> is connected to the gate electrode of the NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b>. The source electrode of the NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b> is connected to the VSS power supply. One end of the resistance R<b>3</b> is connected to the drain electrode of this transistor, and the other end of the resistance R<b>3</b> is connected to the VDD power supply. A bias voltage is supplied to the gate electrode of the NMOS transistor MN<b>3</b> from the drain electrode of the NMOS transistor MN<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When an input signal In and an inverted input signal Inb are input to the gate electrodes of the NMOS transistors MN<b>1</b> and MN<b>2</b>, respectively, an output signal Out is output from the drain electrode of the NMOS transistor MN<b>2</b>, and an inverted output signal Outb is output from the drain electrode of the NMOS transistor MN<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a plurality of stages of clock buffer circuits is connected in series, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for waveform shaping and timing adjustment of a clock signal. When an offset voltage is then present between outputs (at nodes A and A′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of a certain clock buffer circuit, the duty ratios of the output signal Out and the inverted output signal Outb vary, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Since the plurality of stages of clock buffer circuits is connected in series, the offset voltage may be accumulated and increased, so that the clock signal may disappear at some midpoint, at the worst. The larger the voltage gain of the clock buffer circuit is, the more noticeable this becomes. Since the voltage gain of the conventional clock buffer circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> changes proportional to the square root of the load resistances R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, variations of the load resistances become a main factor for variations of the voltage gain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1 discloses means for compensating for the offset voltage as described above in SCFL (Source Coupled FET Logic) clock buffer circuits that use GaAs FETs. As an example of a first technique, providing capacitive coupling between stages and applying a direct current bias to a subsequent stage are disclosed. Further, as an example of a second technique, direct current feedback is provided between the stages of the SCFL clock buffer circuits, thereby suppressing the voltage gain and compensating for the offset voltage.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The example of the first technique in Patent Document 1 has various problems associated with the capacitive coupling. When the capacitive coupling is performed, an HPF (High Pass Filter) is constituted by a coupled capacitance and the input impedance of the subsequent stage. Thus, it is necessary to sufficiently reduce the cut-off frequency of this HPF with respect to the frequency of a transmitted clock. When the cut-off frequency is high, attenuation occurs in the HPF. Thus, the need for increasing the gain of a clock buffer circuit arises. For this reason, the highest operating frequency of the clock buffer circuit is lowered because the bandwidth of the clock buffer circuit with a high gain is generally narrowed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to reduce the cut-off frequency of the HPF, the need for increasing the capacitance value of the coupled capacitance arises, so that a large area is required for circuit integration. Assume that a clock of one GHz is transmitted, for example. Assume that the characteristic impedance of a clock system is 500Ω and the cut-off frequency of the HPF is 100 MHz. Then, when the capacitance value of the coupled capacitance is determined, approximately 3 pF of the coupled capacitance becomes necessary. For this reason, two 3 pF capacitances per buffer become necessary in order to transmit a differential clock, so that a large area becomes necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, when the capacitive coupling is employed, a direct-current bias circuit is always required as an input to the subsequent stage. Since this direct-current bias circuit also becomes necessary for each clock buffer circuit, this becomes a factor for increasing the area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The problem of the example of the second technique in Patent Document 1 is an influence on a transmission speed associated with the direct-current feedback and an influence on the gain of the buffer. When the direct-current feedback is provided, a direct-current gain is limited, so that the influence of the offset voltage becomes favorable by the limitation. However, when the number of stages of connection in series is increased, the influence becomes much more effective by multiplication of the gains of the respective stages. Thus, it follows that the influence cannot become ignored. When the gain is set to a lower value, the gain may be lowered at a clock frequency required, so that clock transmission may also be affected.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, since the path of the direct-current feedback acts as a load on a preceding stage, the load resistance is reduced when the gain cannot be set to be high. Thus, the problem of an increase in current consumption also arises. Now assume that the characteristic impedance of the clock system is 500Ω, the value of a feedback resistance becomes 1000Ω when the voltage gain is set to two. The load resistance as seen from the preceding stage becomes 1500Ω. It means that the load with a considerably low resistance value (a heavy load) will be driven.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a clock buffer circuit constituted from a differential amplifier comprising a pair of load resistances, a pair of differential stage transistors, a constant current source transistor for supplying an operating current to the differential stage transistors, and a bias circuit for supplying to the constant current source transistor a bias voltage according to the resistance value of the load resistances; wherein the bias circuit generates the bias voltage so controlled that the voltage gain of the clock buffer circuit becomes a predetermined value with respect to a variation of the resistance value of the load resistances.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The clock buffer circuit according to the present invention includes the bias current for generating the bias voltage so controlled that the voltage gain of the clock buffer circuit becomes a predetermined value. With this arrangement, the clock buffer circuit that maintains a higher speed while suppressing characteristic deterioration caused by an offset voltage can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present invention, the clock buffer circuit generates the bias voltage so controlled that the operating current changes inversely proportional to the resistance value of said load resistances raised to the power of a number between one and two (not including one but including two).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further aspect of the present invention, the clock buffer circuit generates the bias voltage so controlled that the operating current changes inversely proportional to the resistance value of said load resistances raised to the power of two, thereby keeping a voltage gain of said clock buffer circuit to be constant with respect to a variation of the resistance value of said load resistances.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The meritorious effects of the present invention are summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When the present invention is used, variations at the time of manufacture of resistance elements and variations of the resistance value of the resistance elements due to temperature can be roughly cancelled, so that speeding up of the clock buffer circuit can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Since the variations at the time of manufacture of the resistance elements and the variations of the resistance value of the resistance elements depending on the temperature can be almost cancelled, low power consumption of the clock buffer circuit can be implemented. Further, the circuit is formed of a configuration directly connected with direct-current without extra direct-current feedback path. Thus, the low power consumption can be thereby achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Since the circuit has no capacitive coupling, no direct-current bias circuit, and no extra direct-current feedback path, the invention disclosed in this application can be implemented almost with the clock buffer circuit alone. High integration can be thereby achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since the circuit has no capacitive coupling, no direct-current bias circuit, and no extra direct-current feedback path, the invention disclosed in this application can be roughly implemented with the clock buffer circuit alone. Thus, simplification of the configuration of the circuit and devices therein can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The variations at the time of manufacture of the resistance elements and the variations of the resistance value of the resistance elements due to temperature can be roughly cancelled. Clock transmission can be thereby implemented without extra additional circuit such as an offset canceling circuit or the like. Improvement in transmission efficiency thus can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Since the clock transmission can be performed with no additional circuit that is unnecessary for the clock buffer circuit, the circuit can be simplified, and improvement in reliability of an integrated circuit can be achieved.</p>

When Equation (4) is substituted into Equation (1), the following Equation (5) is obtained:

<br/>
As clear from Equation (5), it can be seen that by changing the bias current Ib inversely proportional to the square of the resistance value R<sub>0 </sub>with respect to a variation of the resistance value R<sub>0 </sub>of the load resistances, the gain Av is kept constant. In the present invention, by changing the bias current Ib inversely proportional to the square of the resistance value R<sub>0 </sub>with respect to a variation of the load resistance value R<sub>0 </sub>so as to make the gain constant, the gain Av is kept constant. In clock transmission using the clock buffer circuit or the like, however, the clock buffer circuit is often driven to a saturation region thereof, for use. In the method of use as described above, when the bias current Ib is changed inversely proportional to the square of the resistance value, amplitude variation in the saturation region will occur. Thus, when the bias current Ib is changed inversely proportional to the resistance value raised to power of a number between one and two (not including one but including two) so as to avoid this and to make the gain constant, the amplitude variation and gain variation in the saturation region can be optimized.
