<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a resin surface treating agent containing as an effective component at least one cerium compound selected from tetravalent and trivalent cerium compounds. The surface treating method of the present invention is a method of bringing a surface of a resin into contact with a surface treating agent containing as an effective component at least one cerium compound selected from tetravalent and trivalent cerium compounds, and thereafter treating the surface with an acidic aqueous solution. This activates the resin surface and thereby increases a strength of adhesion of, for instance, a polyimide-based resin film with metal wires, as well as a strength of adhesion of a polyimide-based resin film with another resin. Thus, a resin surface treating agent that provides excellent productivity and reduces processing costs, as well as a surface treating method using the same, are provided.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a surface treating agent for activating a resin surface, as well as to a resin surface treating method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Among wiring boards used in electronic equipment, a flexible printed-circuit board has excellent features such as flexibility, thinness, and lightness of weight. Among the flexible printed-circuit boards, those having a two-layered structure in which polyimide used for forming a base film and copper used for forming a conductive layer are bonded to each other without use of an adhesive has excellently heat-resistance, and therefore is demanded increasingly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods for manufacturing substrates of the above-mentioned two-layered-structure flexible printed-circuit boards include plating, sputtering, casting, and laminating. Among these methods, the plating and the sputtering exhibit greater freedom in selecting a polyimide and easier manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The plating is a method including a step of forming a conductive thin seed layer on a polyimide film by electroless plating, and a subsequent step of forming a conductive layer of copper. The sputtering is a method including a step of forming a conductive thin seed layer on a polyimide film by sputtering and a subsequent step of forming a conductive layer of copper by electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the foregoing plating methods, the semiadditive process is proposed. In the semiadditive process, to obtain intimate adhesion of the electroless copper plated layer with an interlayer insulator, conventionally recesses and projections are formed on a surface of the insulator by applying a chemical agent containing an alkaline permanganic acid solution and the like, and a plated layer is formed on the surface with the recesses and projections.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, design pitches have been narrowed with the recent trend of size reduction and improved performance of electronic equipment, and accordingly, higher signal frequencies are used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case where an electroless copper plated layer is formed on a surface with recesses and projections as described above, copper etching residues tend to remain after pattern formation by etching, and particularly in the case where the pattern pitch is narrow, there arises a problem that ion migration and other troubles tend to be induced by etching residues.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, when a clock frequency of current running through an electric conductor increases, current runs only in the vicinity of a surface of the conductor due to the skin effect, and here, in the case where recesses and projections are present at an interface between the plated copper layer and the insulator as described above, there arises a problem that signal transfer is retarded in the vicinity of the interface with the recesses and projections.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As an insulator used in the flexible board, a polyimide-based resin is used, and the polyimide substrate has to be brought into close contact with a resin of a bonding sheet, a photosolder resist and the like. However, the contact thereof with the resin greatly varies with the kind of the resin of the counterpart due to the properties of polyimide, and adhesion cannot be achieved at all when the resin is of one of certain specific kinds. Therefore, there has been a problem that the material for the use is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a method for processing a copper surface to improve the adhesion thereof with a resin, a blackening process (formation of copper oxide using strong-alkali aqueous solution) is performed in some cases. In this method, however, recesses and projections occur on an interface, which is expected to result in problems like those described above.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, since polyimide generally provides poor adhesion to a metal, a substrate manufactured by the aforementioned plating or sputtering method has a problem that a polyimide film provides poor adhesion to a seed layer and a copper layer. To cope with this, the following patent publication 1 has proposed that a surface of polyimide is subjected to plasma treatment so that the adhesion thereof to the seed layer and the copper layer is improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Patent Publication 1: JP-A-3(1991)-56541</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the plasma treatment requires a high-priced processing machine and a vacuum atmosphere for the treatment, and hence it has a problem of low productivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, to solve the problems of the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a surface treating agent for treating a surface of a resin of any one of various kinds that provides excellent productivity and allows low-cost treatment, as well as provides a method for treating a surface of a resin of any one of various kinds that uses the foregoing surface treating agent.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides a resin surface treating agent containing as an effective component at least one cerium compound selected from tetravalent and trivalent cerium compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, a resin surface treating method of the present invention is characterized in that a surface treating agent that contains as an effective component at least one cerium compound selected from tetravalent and trivalent cerium compounds is brought into contact with a surface of a resin.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present invention, a resin surface is activated, whereby, for instance, the strength of adhesion of a film of a resin of any one of various kinds such as a polyimide-based resin film to metal wires is improved as well as the strength of adhesion of the resin film to another resin is improved. Further, the present invention provides a resin surface treating agent that provides excellent productivity and allows low-cost treatment, as well as a method for treating a surface of a resin with use of the foregoing treating agent.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention improves the adhesion strength of a resin surface in its smooth state by chemically processing the resin surface without roughening the same. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a resin surface suitable for electronic materials that are suitable for finer patterns and higher clock frequencies. Further, it is possible to improve the close contact between resins that conventionally provide poor contact with each other. It should be noted that a surface of a resin treated with the treating agent of the present invention exhibited no change in its appearance as observed through a scanning electron microscope (SEM) photograph (3500X).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventors of the present invention have found that a resin surface comes to have excellent adhesion to a metal, particularly copper, when being brought into contact with an aqueous solution containing a tetravalent and/or trivalent cerium compound(s), and the like. Further, they have found that the surface has excellent adhesion to another resin. Still further, they have found that the surface treating agent of the present invention has an excellent dissolving property for dissolving smear that is produced when holes are bored in a resin with laser or by drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">More specifically, the present invention is achieved with the following constitutions:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0021">(1) a resin surface treating agent containing a tetravalent and/or trivalent cerium compound(s) as its effective component; and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0022">(2) a surface treating method wherein a surface treating agent containing a tetravalent and/or trivalent cerium compound(s) as its effective component is brought into contact with a surface of a resin.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">Here, the term “effective component” refers to a component accounting for a concentration ranging from 0.01 percent to 50 percent (percent by mass, hereinafter the term “percent (%)” refers to “percent by mass (mass %)”), or 0.00001 mol/kg to 2 mol/kg equivalent to a concentration of cerium.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">The present invention is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">A tetravalent cerium compound used in the present invention is a component that can reform a surface of a resin so that the surface exhibits excellent adhesion to another member made of a metal or a resin. Further, it is a component that dissolves a smear of the resin. Specific examples of the same include: cerium (IV) hexanitrates such as cerium (IV) diammonium nitrate and potassium cerium (IV) nitrate; cerium (IV) tetraammonium sulfate; and cerium (IV) sulfate. The cerium compounds may be hydrates such as cerium (IV) tetraammonium sulfate dihydrate, and cerium (IV) sulfate tetrahydrate. Two or more of the tetravalent cerium compounds may be used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">The trivalent cerium compound used in the present invention may be any one of cerium (III) acetate, cerium (III) ammonium nitrate, cerium (III) carbonate, cerium (III) chloride, cerium (III) fluoride, cerium (III) nitrate, cerium (III) sulfate, cerium (III) bromide, cerium (III) iodide, cerium (III) oxalate, cerium (III) perchloride, cerium (III) sulfide, and hydrates of the same. Two or more of the foregoing trivalent cerium compounds may be used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">The tetravalent cerium compound(s) and the trivalent cerium compound(s) may be used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">The surface treating agent of the present invention preferably is a solution of a tetravalent and/or trivalent cerium compound(s). A solvent to be used preferably is water, but any solvent, for instance, alcohol, can be used without particular limitation as long as it can dissolve the tetravalent and/or trivalent cerium compound(s).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">The following description refers to a case where the surface treating agent of the present invention is in a state of solution as the preferred state.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">The concentration of the tetravalent and/or trivalent cerium compound(s) in the surface treating agent preferably is 0.01 mass % to 50 mass % in total, and more preferably 0.1 mass % to 30 mass % in total. In the case where the concentration is less than 0.01 mass %, the reactivity thereof with a resin tends to decrease. In the case where the concentration exceeds 50 mass %, the dissolution of the agent tends to be incomplete. The following describes a case where an aqueous solution is prepared with a cerium compound of the present invention and the concentration is expressed with an effective concentration mol/kg. In this case, a range of an effective concentration of cerium preferably is 0.00001 mol/kg to 2 mol/kg. With the concentration of less than 0.00001 mol/kg, the treatment is ineffective. On the other hand, the compound of the concentration exceeding 2 mol/kg requires heating so as to be dissolved, and even if it is dissolved, stability is very poor. A preferable range of the concentration is 0.0001 mol/kg to 1.5 mol/kg. With the concentration of less than 0.0001 mol/kg, the achievement of the effect is retarded, while the achieved effect and the improvement of adhesion are more or less insufficient. When the concentration is more than 1.5 mol/kg, heating is required. A further preferable range of the concentration is 0.001 mol/kg to 1 mol/kg. With the concentration of less than 0.001 mol/kg, a longer treating time is required, even though the desired effect is achieved eventually. With the concentration of more than 1 mol/kg, the compound tends to be dissolved incompletely without heating. The most preferable concentration is 0.01 mol/kg to 0.9 mol/kg.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">Further various additives may be added to the surface treating agent of the present invention. For instance, acids for improving the stability of a cerium compound may be added, such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, formic acid, and acetic acid, as well as a surfactant for improving wettability and reactivity with a polyimide-based resin or other resins.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">No specific limitation is laid on a range of a concentration of the foregoing strong acid, and the effect of stabilizing a cerium compound is improved with an added amount thereof, though the added amount thereof normally is not more than 50 %, preferably 5 % to 30%. With an excessively high concentration, in the case where a material to be treated is a material in which a resin and a metal coexist, the metal tends to erode.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">The surface treating agent of the present invention can be prepared easily, by dissolving the above-mentioned components in a solvent such as water. The water preferably is an ion-exchanged water or the like, from which ionic substances and impurities have been removed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">The resin to be treated with the surface treating agent of the present invention may be any resin. Preferable resins include polyimide-based resins, epoxy-based resins, cyanate-based resins, acryl-based resins, acryl-epoxy-based resins, acryl-butadiene-styrene (ABS)-based resins, aramid-based resins, polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-based resins, polypropylene (PP)-based resins, polycarbonate (PC)-based resins, urethane-based resins, polyethylene (PE)-based resins, and polyamide-based resins. Among these, particularly the polyimide-based resins are used preferably. No specific limitation is laid on the polyimide-based resins, and any resin having an imide structure may be used, for instance, polypyromellitic acid imide, polybiphenyl imide, polyketone imide, polyamide imide, polyester imide, polyether imide, polyamide ester imide, polyimidazopyrrolone imide, polyhydantoin imide, polyoxazole imide, cyanate-modified bismaleimide, or silicone-modified polyimide.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">When a surface of a polyimide-based resin is treated with the surface treating agent of the present invention, it is preferable that the surface of the polyimide-based resin is treated preliminarily with an alkaline aqueous solution that dissolves sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, monoethanolamine, or the like so that the surface has higher wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">As a method for bringing the surface treating agent of the present invention with a surface of a resin, spraying, showering, immersion, or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">The conditions for bringing the surface treating agent and the surface of the resin in contact with each other are not limited specifically, but normally the temperature of the surface treating agent preferably is 20° C. to 50° C., and the time while they are in contact preferably is 1 minute to 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">Residues of a cerium compound tend to adhere to a surface of a resin that has been treated with the surface treating agent of the present invention, and hence, it is preferable that the residues are dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution so as to be removed therefrom, and the surface is washed with water and dried.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">Basically, the trivalent cerium compounds produce the same effect as that of the tetravalent cerium compounds, but the trivalent cerium compounds have an advantage that fewer residues remain on a resin surface after the surface treatment. Therefore, in the case where trivalent cerium compounds are used, the foregoing finishing step with an acid is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">Examples of the acidic aqueous solution include aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid. The acidic aqueous solution preferably has a concentration of about 0.01% to 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">The conditions for the treatment with the acidic aqueous solution are not limited specifically, but normally immersion at 20° C. to 50° C. for 2 minutes to 30 minutes is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">A resin treated with the surface treating agent of the present invention has improved adhesion to another member made of, for instance, a metal, a resin, ceramic, or glass. Examples of the metal include an electrolessly plated film of copper, nickel/chromium alloy, or aluminum, a sputtering film, and a vapor deposition film. Examples of the foregoing resin include phenol resins, epoxy resins, heat-resistant epoxy resins, cyanate-modified bismaleimide resins, silicon carbide resins, polyphenylene ether, polyimide-based resins, and liquid crystal polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">Examples of preferable combinations include:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0044">Resin—metal: polyimide resin—copper, epoxy resin—copper, cyanate resin—copper, aramid resin—copper, ABS resin—nickel</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0045">Resin—resin: polyimide resin—epoxy resin, polyimide resin—(acryl-epoxy) resin</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">Preferable resins are polyimide resins, epoxy resins, cyanate resins, acrylic (acryl-epoxy) resins, ABS resins, and aramid-based resins.</p>
