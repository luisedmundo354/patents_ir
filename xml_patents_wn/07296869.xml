<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an ink jet recording head and an ink jet recording apparatus for imprinting a plurality of different kinds of ink, such as inks of a plurality of colors, on a recording medium, such as paper.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among known ink jet recording heads for printing color images, there are so-called integrated multicolor type ink jet recording heads, in which a plurality of heat generating resistance devices (electrothermal conversion devices) matching inks of a plurality of colors and densities are arranged on the same substrate, and nozzles and flow channels matching the respective heat generating resistance devices are also disposed on this substrate (e.g., the Japanese Patent No. 2718939).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, further improvement in picture quality, especially in terms of the definition and contrast of recorded pictures, has come to be required of color ink jet recording apparatuses. Known ways to meet this requirement include enhancing the definition of pictures by increasing the densities of dye of inks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, as the densities of dye of inks are increased, they become more viscous. Increased viscosity entails a slowdown in the refilling of nozzles with inks after they are discharged from the outlet. In short, the higher the densities of dye of inks, the slower the refilling after they are discharged from the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, where an ink of a density of dye exceeding a prescribed level of viscosity is used, ink drips may be discharged before the nozzle is fed with a sufficient quantity of ink, which would prevent stable discharging of ink drips.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">At the same time, the viscosity of ink varies with the temperature and humidity of the external environment. If, for instance, the temperature or the humidity of the external environment is low, the ink will become more viscous, likely to make stable discharging of ink drips impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, a color ink jet recording apparatus using inks of densities of dye exceeding a prescribed level of viscosity is more susceptible to inability to stably discharge ink drips when the temperature or the humidity of the external environment is low. Eventually, it may become impossible to normally form main drips of ink, or faulty discharging may occur as a consequence of the deviation of the discharging direction of ink drips from the designed discharging direction or a total failure to discharge ink drips.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to enhance the definition and contrast of recorded pictures by providing an ink jet recording head capable of stable discharging of ink drips even when inks of densities of dye exceeding a prescribed level of viscosity are used and an ink jet recording apparatus using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the invention is to provide an ink jet recording head having a recording element substrate including three or more discharge port arrays comprising a plurality of discharge ports and recording elements for discharging ink from the discharge ports and supplying heat to areas around the discharge ports, wherein each of the discharge port arrays matches one or another of a plurality of types of ink whose viscosity decreases with a rise in temperature, and the discharge port arrays matching the most viscous of the inks to be discharged are arranged between other discharge port arrays, and an ink jet recording apparatus using the same.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention to be described in detail below relates to an ink jet recording head intended to enhance the definition and contrast of recorded pictures, for instance, and capable of stably discharging ink drips even if inks whose densities of dye exceed a prescribed viscosity are used and an ink jet recording apparatus using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One preferred embodiment of the invention will be described in detail below with reference to drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrate the essential part of an ink jet recording head, which is a first preferred embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a plan of the essential part of the ink jet recording head, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a section along line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a recording element substrate <b>300</b> as a first recording element substrate has a plurality of discharge port arrays <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, and each discharge port array comprises a plurality of discharge ports <b>10</b> arranged in the vertical scanning direction of the ink jet recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The discharge port arrays <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are so disposed as to be in a prescribed order in the recording element substrate <b>300</b>. In this embodiment, incidentally, the discharge port arrays <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are disposed in parallel to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the discharge port arrays <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> matches one or another of a plurality of types of ink whose viscosity decreases with a rise in temperature. Each of the discharge ports <b>10</b> discharges drips of ink matched with the discharge port array to which the discharge port belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The discharge port arrays <b>11</b> comprise a discharge port array <b>11</b><i>a </i>and a discharge port array <b>11</b><i>b</i>; the discharge port arrays <b>12</b> comprise a discharge port array <b>12</b><i>a </i>and a discharge port array <b>12</b><i>b</i>; the discharge port arrays <b>13</b> comprise a discharge port array <b>13</b><i>a </i>and a discharge port array <b>13</b><i>b</i>; and the discharge port arrays <b>14</b> comprise a discharge port array <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a discharge port arrays <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the recording element substrate <b>300</b> is provided with a substrate <b>20</b> over which heat generating resistance devices <b>50</b>, which are both energy conversion devices and recording elements, are formed and an orifice plate <b>60</b>, which is another substrate in which the discharge ports <b>10</b> are formed. Incidentally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, elements having the same configurations as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are denoted by respectively the same reference signs.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The substrate <b>20</b> in this embodiment is formed of a silicon single crystal substrate of &lt;100&gt; in orientation, and over its contact face <b>20</b><i>a </i>with the orifice plate <b>60</b> are formed heat generating resistance devices <b>50</b> and electric wiring (not shown) of aluminum or some other material for supplying drive power to the heat generating resistance devices <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The substrate <b>20</b> is provided with four through holes <b>31</b> through <b>34</b> formed by anisotropic etching. The through hole <b>31</b> serves as an ink feed hole <b>31</b> for feeding ink in the liquid form to the discharge port arrays <b>11</b>. The through hole <b>32</b> similarly serves as an ink feed hole <b>32</b> for feeding ink to the discharge port array <b>12</b>; the through hole <b>33</b>, as an ink feed hole <b>33</b> for feeding ink to the discharge port array <b>13</b>; and the through hole <b>34</b>, as an ink feed hole <b>34</b> for feeding ink to the discharge port array <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Incidentally, though this embodiment uses a silicon substrate of &lt;100&gt; in orientation as the substrate <b>20</b>, the substrate <b>20</b> is not confined to a silicon substrate of &lt;100&gt; in orientation, but can be replaced with something else as appropriate. For instance, the substrate <b>20</b> may be a silicon substrate of &lt;110&gt; in orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Where a silicon substrate of &lt;110&gt; in orientation is used as the substrate <b>20</b>, when the substrate <b>20</b> is etched to form the ink feed holes <b>31</b> through <b>34</b>, the etching proceeds perpendicularly to the substrate <b>20</b> (in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>20</b>), ink feed holes whose sectional shape little varies in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>20</b> can be readily obtained. Therefore, the size of the substrate <b>20</b> can be determined on the basis of the size of the ink feed holes <b>31</b> through <b>34</b> to be bored into the substrate <b>20</b>, and this feature facilitates a reduction in the size of the ink jet recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further in this embodiment, though the etching process facilitates the formation of the ink feed hole <b>31</b> through <b>34</b>, the method of forming the ink feed hole <b>31</b> through <b>34</b> is not restricted to etching, but they can be formed in some other appropriate way. For instance, the ink feed holes <b>31</b> through <b>34</b> can as well be formed by sand blasting or laser irradiation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The orifice plate <b>60</b> disposed over the contact face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>20</b> is formed of photosensitive epoxy resin in this embodiment, and the discharge ports <b>10</b> and nozzles <b>40</b> are formed in positions matching the heat generating resistance devices <b>50</b> by a process described in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. S62-264957, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Incidentally, the recording element substrate <b>300</b> may as well be formed by, for instance the method described in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H9-11479. More specifically, after forming a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film over a silicon substrate as the substrate <b>20</b>, ink feed holes are bored into the substrate <b>20</b> in a state in which the film is left as is; then the orifice plate <b>60</b> is disposed over the film; then, the silicon oxide film or the silicon nitride film present in the ink feed holes is removed; and through holes, discharge ports and nozzles are formed in the orifice plate <b>60</b>. In this way, precise ink jet recording heads can be fabricated at low cost. Therefore, it is desirable to form the recording element substrate <b>300</b> by this method.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The recording element substrate <b>300</b> having the substrate <b>20</b> and the orifice plate <b>60</b> discharges ink or some other liquid out of the discharge ports <b>10</b> by utilizing the pressure of bubbles generated by the membrane boiling of the liquid by the thermal energy supplied from the heat generating resistance devices <b>50</b> to the nozzles <b>40</b>, and thereby performs recording.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the recording element substrate <b>300</b> receives the drive signal, the heat generating resistor <b>50</b> to which the received drive signal is supplied is driven, ink supplied from the ink tank via the ink flow channel forming member <b>102</b> is discharged from the discharge ports <b>10</b> disposed in positions matching the driven heat generating resistor <b>50</b>, and recording is thereby performed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In recent years, further improvement in picture quality, especially in terms of the definition and contrast of recorded pictures, has come to be required of color ink jet recording apparatuses using such ink jet recording heads as are described above. Extensively known ways to meet this requirement include enhancing the definition of pictures by increasing the densities of dye of inks.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, as the densities of dye of inks are increased, they become more viscous.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the relationship between the density of dye of a certain ink and its viscosity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where the density of dye of the ink is 4.5% for instance, its viscosity is about 2.5 mPa·s, but if the density of dye of the ink increases to 6%, its viscosity will rise to around 2.7 mPa·s.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As the ink's own viscosity increases and further raised by the influences of the temperature and humidity of the external environment to surpass a certain limit, if it is attempted to execute recording by discharging ink drips, the discharge of first drips of ink from the discharge ports will become unstable. Eventually, it may become impossible to normally form main drips of ink, or faulty discharging may occur as a consequence of the deviation of the discharging direction of ink drips from the designed discharging direction or a total failure to discharge ink drips.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An effective way to eliminate discharge failure due to the viscosity of ink and achieve stable discharging is to increase the temperature of the recording element substrate <b>300</b> when the viscosity of ink is above a prescribed level and thereby to reduce the viscosity of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the ink jet recording head in this embodiment, a plurality of discharge ports <b>10</b> are provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and they constitute the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> through <b>14</b>, arranged in the scanning direction at a prescribed pitch in the same recording element substrate <b>300</b>. Where a plurality of discharge port arrays are disposed in the same recording element substrate <b>300</b> as in this case, it is made possible to prevent heat from being transmitted unevenly within the same recording element substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> disposed in the central area of the recording element substrate <b>300</b> (for instance, where the plurality of discharge port arrays are so disposed as to be in a prescribed order, the part containing the discharge port arrays which come at the center of the arrangement of the discharge port arrays) have adjoining their both ends other discharge port arrays which become heat sources (the discharge port arrays <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>). Accordingly, heat is more difficult to escape from the central discharge port arrays in the arrangement of discharge port arrays than from the discharge port array <b>12</b> and discharge port arrays <b>13</b> which are at the ends.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To add, if the number of discharge port arrays in this embodiment is even, “the discharge port arrays which come at the center of the arrangement of the discharge port arrays” shall be either or both of the two discharge port arrays <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> which come at the center of the arrangement of the discharge port arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Therefore, heat is more difficult to escape from the discharge port arrays <b>14</b> arranged in the central area of the recording element substrate <b>300</b>, as they have on both of their adjoining sides heat generating discharge port arrays (the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> and the discharge port arrays <b>13</b>), than from the discharge port arrays <b>12</b> and the discharge port arrays <b>13</b> which are at the ends in the arrangement of discharge port arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Or when ink drips are discharged at the same time from all of the plurality of discharge port arrays and required recording is performed afterwards as in pre-discharging for stable ink discharging (ink discharging not intended for the execution of recording) for instance, discharge port arrays positioned between two pairs of discharge port arrays (the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> and the discharge port arrays <b>14</b> in this embodiment), the temperature more readily rises therein and heat is more difficult to escape from them than from discharge port arrays at the ends in the arrangement of discharge port arrays (the discharge port arrays <b>12</b> and the discharge port arrays <b>13</b> in this embodiment), as they have on both of their adjoining sides heat generating discharge port arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Therefore, when ink drips are discharged at the same time from all of the plurality of discharge port arrays, the temperature in the part of the recording element substrate <b>300</b> close to the discharge port arrays positioned between two pairs of discharge port arrays becomes higher than elsewhere in the recording element substrate <b>300</b> close to discharge port arrays at the ends in the arrangement of discharge port arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After ink drips are discharged at the same time from the plurality of discharge port arrays, heat dissipation from the discharge port arrays matched with the most viscous ink is less than that from the discharge port arrays which are at the ends of the plurality of discharge port arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this embodiment, the discharge port arrays discharging the ink of the color of the viscosity most susceptible to unstable discharging or inks of a highly viscous type when recording is to be performed on a recording medium using inks of a plurality of colors or a plurality of types are arranged between two discharge port arrays whose temperature is very likely to become higher than other areas in the recording element substrate <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To add, in this embodiment, the discharge port arrays discharging the ink of a color of high viscosity or the ink of a highly viscous type are positioned to be the central arrays in the arrangement of discharge port arrays (in this embodiment either the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> or the discharge port arrays <b>14</b>; hereinafter they are supposed to be the discharge port arrays <b>11</b>). Incidentally, the discharge port arrays which come at the center of the arrangement of the discharge port arrays are very likely to be higher in temperature than the area where other discharge port arrays are present in the recording element substrate <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, since the heat generating resistance devices matched with the two discharge port arrays adjacent to the discharge port arrays discharging the most viscous ink or the region of the recording element substrate in which those heat generating resistance devices are disposed can be utilized as the heat sources for the most viscous ink, it is easier to raise the temperature of the most viscous ink to reduce the viscosity of the ink than in a case where, for instance, the discharge port arrays discharging the most viscous ink are arranged at the ends of the plurality of parallel discharge port arrays, and it is thereby made possible to eliminate faulty discharging of ink drips.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Incidentally, this embodiment uses inks of different colors including cyan, magenta, yellow and black in forming a picture on a recording medium such as paper by discharging ink drips thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Black ink is required to be enhanced in OD value in order to improve the clarity of recorded pictures. To meet this requirement, the OD value is enhanced in this embodiment by raising the density of dye of black ink. As the black ink is accordingly higher in the density of dye, it has a composition of higher viscosity than other inks.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For instance, the viscosities of cyan, magenta and yellow inks used in this embodiment are around 2.2 mPa·s, that of the black is 2.7 mPa·s, 1.2 times or even more compared with the viscosities of the inks of other colors. To add, though the viscosity of the most viscous one among the plurality of inks need not be higher than the viscosities of other inks, specifically by 1.2 times or more, the greater the difference in viscosity in this comparison, the higher the definition and the contrast of the recorded pictures that can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> through <b>14</b> of the recording element substrate <b>300</b> in this embodiment, the outer discharge port arrays <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are respectively matched with cyan (C) and magenta (M), while the inner discharge port arrays <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> are respectively matched with black (K) and yellow (Y).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Therefore, black ink is supplied from the ink tank <b>200</b>K to the ink feed hole <b>31</b>, yellow ink from the ink feed hole <b>34</b> to the ink tank <b>200</b>Y, magenta ink from the ink tank <b>200</b>M to the ink feed hole <b>33</b>, and cyan ink from the ink tank <b>200</b>C to the ink feed hole <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Therefore, ink drips of cyan are discharged from the discharge port arrays <b>12</b>, ink drips of magenta from the discharge port arrays <b>13</b>, and ink drips of yellow from the discharge port arrays <b>14</b>. On the other hand, the discharge port arrays <b>11</b>, whose temperature rises above those of the discharge port arrays <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, discharge drips of black ink, which is the most viscous among the plurality of inks.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The drips of black ink, which is the most viscous among the plurality of inks, may as well be discharged from the discharge port arrays <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, the configuration may be such that the three other discharge port arrays than those which discharge black ink discharge any of the three other inks including cyan ink, magenta ink and yellow ink, whose viscosities are about equal.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">This embodiment, since the most viscous one out of the plurality of inks is discharged from the discharge port arrays whose temperature is likely to become higher than those of the other discharge port arrays by reason of the structure of the ink jet recording head, for instance discharge port arrays arranged between two discharge port arrays, or more specifically the central ones in the arrangement of discharge port arrays, can obviate the usually experienced faulty discharging due to the most viscous ink, perform more stable discharging and provide finer pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, as the ink of the highest density of dye among the plurality of inks is used as the most viscous one among the plurality of inks, even if inks of densities of dye exceeding the prescribed viscosity are used to enhance the definition and contrast of recorded pictures, ink drips can be stably discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Incidentally, this embodiment is not confined to an ink jet recording head in which discharge port arrays are arranged at a prescribed pitch in the scanning direction of moving means, such as a carriage, for moving the ink jet recording head relative to the recording medium, but may as well be in a form in which the plurality of discharge port arrays extend in a direction crossing the carried recording medium. It may also be an ink jet recording head having the discharge port arrays arranged as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a plan of another example of ink jet recording head, more specifically an example in which discharge port arrays having the discharge ports <b>10</b> arranged in the vertical scanning direction of the ink jet recording head (specifically, the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> through <b>14</b>) are arranged in a recording element substrate <b>301</b> in series to the vertical scanning direction of the ink jet recording head.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the recording element substrate <b>301</b>, a plurality of discharge port arrays (specifically, the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> through <b>14</b>) are arranged in series to the vertical scanning direction of the ink jet recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The discharge port arrays <b>11</b> through <b>14</b> are respectively supplied with inks of black (K), cyan (C), magenta (M) and yellow (Y).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this embodiment, the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> which discharge black ink of which the density of dye is high and the viscosity is the highest among the four kinds of ink are the central discharge port arrays in the arrangement of discharge port arrays.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">This embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the heat generating resistance devices matched with the two discharge port arrays adjacent to the discharge port arrays discharging the most viscous ink or the region of the recording element substrate in which those heat generating resistance devices are disposed are utilized as the heat sources for the most viscous ink for discharging ink from the discharge ports, can be simplified in configuration compared with a configuration in which dedicated heat sources are provided for the recording element substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in a recording element substrate <b>302</b>, there are disposed a first discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>a </i>comprising first discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>a </i>and a second discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>b </i>comprising second discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>and <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The first discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>a </i>is disposed in a position deviating by a prescribed distance in the vertical scanning direction of the ink jet recording head from a position where it is axially symmetric to the second discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>b </i>with respect to a straight line X in the same direction as that vertical scanning direction. Therefore, when bidirectional recording is to be accomplished, as it can be done in the same sequence as that of discharging a plurality of inks onto the recording medium, color shading due to the sequence of ink application, which would otherwise occur in bidirectional recording, can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To add, this embodiment uses as the aforementioned prescribed distance half of the distance between adjacent discharge ports in the plurality of discharge ports constituting one discharge port arrays. The position of the i-th discharge port from one end of each of the discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>a </i>through <b>14</b><i>a </i>is so determined that the recording element substrate <b>302</b> moving in the scanning direction pass the same point. Also, the position of the i-th discharge port from one end of each of the discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>b </i>through <b>14</b><i>b </i>is so determined that the recording element substrate <b>302</b> moving in the scanning direction pass the same point.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Therefore, the first discharge port arrays in the first discharge port group and the second discharge port arrays in the second discharge port group discharging the same kind of ink are so arranged, when moving in the scanning direction, that individual discharge ports interpolate other discharge ports of the discharge port arrays, with the result that recording can be accomplished in the vertical scanning direction in a density double that of discharge ports in each discharge port array.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">This embodiment has a configuration in which the ink highest in the density of dye and in viscosity among the plurality of inks is discharged by the discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>b </i>which come at the center of the arrangement of the discharge port arrays, the ink next highest in viscosity is discharged by the discharge port array <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the discharge port arrays <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the ink third highest in viscosity is discharged by the discharge port array <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the discharge port array <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and the ink lowest in viscosity among the plurality of inks is discharged by the outermost discharge port array <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the discharge port array <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For instance where the viscosity levels of the inks of cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y) and black (K) are cyan (C)&lt;magenta (M)&lt;yellow (Y)&lt;black (K), the outermost discharge port arrays <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>discharge the ink of cyan (C), the discharge port arrays <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the ink of magenta (M), the discharge port arrays <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the ink of yellow (Y), and the innermost mutually adjacent discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the ink of black (K), containing the most viscous dye among the plurality of inks.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">This embodiment is so configured that the most viscous ink among the plurality of inks is discharged from the discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>which come to the center in the arrangement of discharge port arrays, and the viscosity of ink discharged from given discharge port arrays decreases as the discharge port arrays are farther away from the center and near either end in the arrangement of discharge port arrays. Since the temperature is likely to fall from the central toward the end discharge port arrays in the arrangement of discharge port arrays, (when ink drips are discharged at the same time from all of the plurality of discharge port arrays and recording is performed afterwards as in pre-discharging, for instance) it is made possible to have more viscous ink to be discharged from higher-temperature discharge port arrays and thereby to achieve stable ink discharging.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">To add, regarding the whole plurality of discharge port arrays, specifically the discharge port arrays <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>in this embodiment, the discharge port arrays belonging to the first discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>a </i>are disposed in a position deviating by a prescribed distance in a direction orthogonal to the scanning direction of the ink jet recording head from a position where they are axially symmetric to the discharge port arrays belonging to the second discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>b </i>with respect to a straight line orthogonal to the scanning direction of the ink jet recording head, but the minimum required number of discharge port arrays to be arranged in this manner is two (an arrangement in which one discharge port array in the first discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>a </i>and one discharge port array in the second discharge port array group <b>400</b><i>b </i>match each other).</p>

Therefore, recording by using the discharge port arrays <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>can be accomplished in a density double the density of discharge port arraying in each discharge port array in the vertical scanning direction.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Also, discharge port arrays <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>for discharging the ink of magenta (M) are arranged in a similar sequence to the discharge port arrays <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>inside the discharge port arrays <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>for discharging the ink of cyan (C).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further inside them, there are disposed the discharge port arrays <b>14</b> for discharging the ink of yellow (Y) and the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> for discharging the ink of black (K), whose viscosity is the highest.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">This embodiment, since the ink of the same kind is discharged in a variety of volumes, can prevent the grainy state of ink drips imprinted on the recording medium from becoming too conspicuous.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Also in this embodiment, the ink jet recording head having a plurality of discharge port arrays for discharging ink of the same kind to be in substantial axial symmetry to the straight line X in the same direction as the vertical scanning direction of the ink jet recording head has an arrangement in which the most viscous ink is discharged from the discharge port arrays which come to the center in the arrangement of discharge port arrays, which are likely to have the highest temperature and the most difficult for heat to escape from among the plurality of discharge port arrays arranged. This arrangement makes it possible to stably discharge the highly viscous ink which is more likely to invite faulty discharging than other inks.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">To add, while in this embodiment, the discharge port arrays which discharge the inks matching them in a variety of volumes are supposed to be the discharge port arrays for discharging the ink of magenta (M) and the discharge port arrays for discharging the ink of cyan (C), the discharge port arrays which discharge inks matching them in a variety of volumes are not limited to these but can altered to some others as appropriate. For instance, at least one of the plurality of discharge port arrays may be enabled to discharge the ink matching them in a variety of volumes.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Further in this embodiment, though the discharge port arrays which discharge the most viscous ink are supposed to be the discharge port arrays which come to the center in the arrangement of discharge port arrays, they are not confined to the central discharge port arrays, but the discharge port arrays for discharging the most viscous ink may be any pair of discharge port arrays disposed between two pairs of discharge port arrays.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrate an ink jet recording head, which is a third preferred embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a plan of the essential part of the ink jet recording head, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a section along line <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Incidentally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, elements having the same configurations as in the preceding figure are denoted by respectively the same reference signs.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this embodiment, heat radiator plates <b>80</b> to prevent the temperature of recording element substrates <b>305</b> from rising are disposed in an ink jet recording head in which discharge port arrays are arranged (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the recording element substrates <b>305</b> are independently provided for inks of different colors.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the heat radiator plates <b>80</b> are in contact with the recording element substrates <b>305</b>, and have openings <b>91</b> through <b>94</b> respectively matching ink feed holes <b>31</b> through <b>34</b> in the recording element substrates <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the heat radiator plates <b>80</b> are so configured as to keep the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> for discharging the most viscous ink lagging behind other nozzle arrays in heat dissipation and higher in temperature than the others by surrounding the discharge port arrays <b>11</b> for discharging the most viscous ink with a groove <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As in this embodiment the efficiency of heat dissipation by the heat radiator plates matching the discharge port arrays for discharging the most viscous ink is kept inferior to that of other discharge port arrays than the discharge port arrays for discharging the most viscous ink, the temperature of the discharge port arrays for discharging the most viscous ink can be kept higher than that of other discharge port arrays, and it is thereby made possible to stably discharge the highly viscous ink which is more likely to invite faulty discharging than other inks.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When ink drips not for recording use are discharged at the same time from all of the plurality of discharge port arrays with a view to stabilizing ink discharging as in pre-discharging for instance, discharge port arrays disposed between two discharge port arrays are more susceptible to temperature rise and difficult to let heat escape than from discharge port arrays at the ends in the arrangement of discharge port arrays, because the discharge port arrays on the two sides become heat sources. Therefore, when ink drips are discharged at the same time from all of the plurality of discharge port arrays, heat dissipation from the discharge port arrays matching the most viscous ink is less than that from the discharge port arrays at the ends in the plurality of discharge port arrays, and the temperature in the vicinity of the most viscous ink is kept higher than that in the vicinities of the discharge port arrays at the ends. By performing recording after that, it is made possible to stably discharge the high viscosity ink which is more likely to invite faulty discharging than other inks.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">To add, the heat radiator plates such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> can as well be used in the first or second preferred embodiment described earlier.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In this embodiment, sub-heaters <b>70</b> are further disposed as heat supply units to control the temperature of a recording element substrate <b>306</b> in the ink jet recording head in which discharge port arrays are arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the sub-heaters <b>70</b> are provided to prevent faulty discharging, which is likely to accompany discharging of ink drips in a low temperature environment, for example, and they are used to raise the temperature of the recording element substrate <b>306</b> before supplying a drive current to the heat generating resistance devices <b>50</b> for discharging ink drips.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the recording element substrate <b>306</b>, the temperature in the vicinities of the sub-heaters <b>70</b> becomes the highest on account of heating by the sub-heaters <b>70</b>. Therefore in this embodiment, the discharge port arrays for discharging the most viscous ink are disposed closest to the sub-heaters <b>70</b> among the plurality of discharge port arrays, and it is thereby made possible to stably discharge the highly viscous ink which is more likely to invite faulty discharging than other inks.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In this embodiment, unlike in the first, second and third preferred embodiments, the discharge port arrays for discharging the most viscous ink may constitute the discharge port arrays at the ends in the arrangement of discharge port arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Although in the embodiments described above the types of liquid (ink) used for recording are supposed to be cyan, magenta, yellow and black, which are most frequently used in the field of ink jet recording, the plurality of inks to be used are not limited to these, but can be altered as appropriate by, for instance, adding ink of another color. The most viscous ink can be the ink of the highest density of dye among the plurality of inks used, and can be some other ink than black ink.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The number of pairs of discharge port arrays can be any number not smaller than three.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The ink jet recording head <b>100</b> is so mounted on an ink jet recording apparatus that the arraying direction of the discharge ports constituting each discharge port arrays (i.e., the direction of each individual discharge port arrays) be different from the aforementioned scanning direction, and recording is accomplished by discharging liquid (ink) from these discharge port arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">An ink jet recording apparatus mounted with any of the ink jet recording heads described above as preferred embodiments of the invention is enabled to stably discharge ink drips.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">For instance, though heat generating resistance devices are used as recording elements for discharging ink from the discharge ports in every embodiment described above, the recording elements need not be heat generating resistance devices, but piezo devices can be used as discharging energy generating elements if only they can discharge from the discharge ports of the discharge port arrays inks respectively matching those discharge port arrays and supply heat to the areas around the ink discharge ports in the first recording element substrate.</p>
