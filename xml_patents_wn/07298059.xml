<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to the field of wind power generation, and in particular to wind farms having multiple wind turbine generators. Specifically, embodiments of the present technique provide a method and system to control power ramp down rate of a wind farm during high wind speed conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wind turbines are regarded as environmentally friendly and relatively inexpensive alternative sources of energy that utilize wind energy to produce electrical power. A wind turbine generator generally includes a wind rotor having a plurality of blades that transform wind energy into rotational motion of a drive shaft, which in turn is utilized to drive a rotor of an electrical generator to produce electrical power. Modern wind power generation systems typically take the form of a wind farm having multiple such wind turbine generators that are operable to supply power to a transmission system providing power to a utility grid. Output from the wind turbine generators is typically combined for transmission to the grid.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wind is an intermittent resource and power supplied by the wind farm to utilities is significantly influenced by changes in wind conditions. Generally, power output of a wind turbine power station increases with wind speed, until the wind speed reaches the rated wind speed for the turbine. With further increases in wind speed, the turbine operates at rated power up to a cut off value or a trip level. This is generally the wind speed at which dynamic loads on the wind turbine cause the mechanical components of the turbine to reach a fatigue limit. As a protective function, at wind speeds higher than a certain speed, wind turbines are often required to shut down, or reduce loads by regulating the pitch of the blades or braking the rotor, thereby leading to a reduced power output of the wind turbine generator, and consequently of the wind farm. However, electrical loads on utilities need to be balanced at all times by power generation units. Hence, utility systems usually have additional power generation resources available, such as thermal generators, that can accommodate this variability in wind conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While the additional power resources can compensate for loss of power from wind farms, some amount of time is required to ramp up their output. For this reason, transmission system operators may require wind farms to control power ramp down rates during high wind speed conditions, particularly during high wind speed shutdown of the wind turbines. Such ramp down control is desirable in order to achieve compatibility between power ramp down rate of the wind farm and power ramp up rates of certain other generation resources supplying power to the utilities. This problem has not been coordinated at the wind farm level to control the aggregate shutdown and ramp down levels before wind turbines reach their high speed shutdown protective limits.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there exits a need for a technique to control operation of a wind farm so as to maintain power ramp down rate of the wind farm within desirable power ramp down rates during high wind speed conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present technique accordingly provides a novel approach toward controlling wind farm ramp rate at high wind speed conditions via a supervisory or a central control system. In one aspect, a method for operating a wind farm having a plurality of wind turbine generators is provided. The method includes monitoring wind speeds at individual wind turbine generators and transmitting a signal from the wind turbine generators to a wind farm control system based on the measured or inferred wind speeds. The method further includes monitoring rate of change of collective power output of the wind farm and controlling the rate of change of power output by coordination of operational states of the wind turbine generators based upon the signals transmitted by the one or more wind turbine generators, operating conditions of the wind turbine generators and the monitored rate of change of power output of the wind farm.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, a wind farm control system is provided. The wind farm control system includes a processing unit and an input/output interface. The input/output interface is configured to receive change of operational state requests from a plurality of wind turbine generators and to transmit authorization signals for curtailment of output to the wind turbine generators based upon the requests. The processing unit is configured to control rate of change of power output of the wind farm by sequencing curtailment of output based on the change of operational state requests received from the plurality of wind turbine generators to coordinate curtailment of output of the wind turbine generators based on operating conditions of the wind turbine generators and monitored rate of change of power output of the wind farm.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another aspect, a wind farm is provided. The wind farm includes a plurality of wind turbine generators and a wind farm control system. The plurality of generators is operable to supply power to a utility system. The wind farm control system is configured to receive change of operational state requests from the wind turbine generators based on measured or inferred wind speed at the wind turbine generators. The wind farm control system is further configured to coordinate operational states of the wind turbine generators based upon the change of operational state requests, operating conditions of the wind turbine generators and a desired rate of change of power output of the wind farm.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present technique provides a system and method for controlling power ramp down rate of a wind farm having a plurality of wind turbine generators at high wind speeds via a central or supervisory wind farm control system. In certain embodiments, the wind farm control system is operable to control power ramp down rate of the wind farm by coordinating shutdown or state change of the wind turbine generators at high wind speeds such that the collective power ramp down rate does not exceed a desired ramp down rate required by transmission system operators. Embodiments of the present technique are described in detail below referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary wind power generation system <b>10</b> in accordance with aspects of the present technique. The wind power generation system <b>10</b> includes a wind farm <b>12</b> having a plurality of wind turbine generators <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> operable to supply electrical power to a utility <b>20</b>. Additionally, the utility <b>20</b> may receive power from other power generation units <b>22</b> to accommodate variability in power output of the wind farm <b>12</b> due to intermittent wind conditions. Other power generation units <b>22</b> may include, for example, thermal, hydroelectric or nuclear power stations, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Wind turbine generators <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> include turbine rotors <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> having plurality of blades which drive rotors of electrical generators <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to produce electrical power. Power produced by generators <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be stepped up in voltage by turbine transformers <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> before being coupled to a medium voltage distribution network <b>42</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a feeder <b>44</b> is used to couple power outputs of wind turbine generators <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> for supply to the medium voltage distribution network <b>42</b>. In a typical application, the medium voltage distribution network <b>42</b> couples power from multiple feeders (not shown), each feeder coupling power outputs of a plurality of wind turbine generators. In certain embodiments, power is coupled from the wind turbine generators <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to the feeder <b>44</b> via switching devices <b>41</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>45</b>, which may include, for example an electrical circuit breaker. Such switching devices are generally used in wind power generation systems to shut down power generation by one or more of the wind turbine generators during high wind conditions. A station transformer <b>48</b> is generally used to step-up voltage of the power from the medium voltage distribution network <b>42</b> to a transmission voltage required by the utility <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with the present technique, the wind farm <b>12</b> includes a wind farm control system <b>50</b> comprising a central controller <b>51</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wind farm control system <b>50</b> is operable to monitor and control rate of change of collective power output of the wind farm <b>12</b>. Rate of change of power output is also referred to in this discussion as power ramp rate. The wind farm control system <b>50</b> further comprises power sensors, such as voltage and current sensors <b>52</b>, which are configured to sense collective power output of the wind farm <b>12</b> and may either be coupled to an output of the station transformer <b>48</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or to a point in the medium voltage distribution network <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The central controller <b>51</b> is configured to communicate with individual wind turbine generators via communication links <b>54</b>, which may be implemented in hardware and software. In certain embodiments, the communication links <b>54</b> may be configured to remotely communicate data signals to and from the central controller <b>51</b> in accordance with any wired or wireless communication protocol known to one skilled in the art. As discussed later, such data signals may comprise signals indicative of operating conditions of individual wind turbine generators transmitted to the central controller <b>51</b> and various command signals communicated by the central controller <b>51</b> to individual wind turbine generators. The central controller <b>51</b> may further be in communication with the medium voltage distribution network <b>42</b>, and may be operable to control various switching devices in the network <b>42</b>, such as capacitors and reactors (not shown) so as to control the power output of the wind farm <b>12</b> within specifications prescribed by transmission system operators.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As discussed earlier, wind turbine generators are generally designed to generate power at wind speeds lower than a predetermined threshold, also referred to as protective wind speed limit, also referred to as cutout wind speed. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the wind turbine generators has an autonomous protection function that requires the wind turbine generator to trip or shut down power generation when average wind speeds at the wind turbine generator exceed this protective wind speed limit. In one embodiment, such as in case of a wind turbine generator having variable-pitch blades, a shutdown operation may include pitching the blades toward stall (i.e. at 90 degrees to the wind direction) or feather (i.e. at 0 degrees to wind direction), resulting in minimal capture of wind energy by the blades. In a further embodiment, a shutdown operation may include mechanical braking of the turbine rotor. In a still further embodiment, shutdown may be accomplished via switching devices as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present technique provides a control mechanism whereby, at high wind speeds (i.e. at wind speeds approaching the protective wind speed limit), wind turbine generators shut down, change state or curtail their power output in an orderly or sequenced manner, to maintain a desired rate of decrease of collective power output or power ramp down rate of the wind farm <b>12</b> under high wind speed conditions. In accordance with aspects of the present technique, individual wind turbine generators are configured to anticipate their protection function when average wind speeds at the respective wind turbine generator approach the protective wind speed limit, and communicate a signal to the central controller <b>51</b>. The signal typically comprises a request by the wind turbine generator to change its existing operational state. In one embodiment, the request includes a shutdown request. In a different embodiment, the request may include a request to operate the wind turbine generator at a curtailed power output. The central controller <b>51</b> is configured to sequence responses or authorizations based on the requests received from the wind turbine generators to maintain the power ramp down rate of the wind farm <b>12</b> within a maximum power ramp down rate specified by transmission system operators. This maximum specified power ramp down rate may be a function of power ramp up rates of the other power generation units <b>22</b>, which generally supply power to the utility to compensate for reduced power output of the wind farm <b>12</b>, for example, during such high wind speed conditions as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of a wind farm ramp rate control system <b>56</b> according to aspects of the present technique. The control system <b>56</b> generally comprises a turbine level control system <b>58</b>, implemented at individual wind turbine generators, and a supervisory control mechanism comprising the wind farm control system <b>50</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the turbine level control system includes one or more indicators of wind speed <b>60</b>, such as nacelle anemometers, which communicate measured wind speeds at the wind turbine generator sensed at different points in time, to a memory device <b>62</b> that records temporal data corresponding to the sensed wind speeds. In alternative embodiments, wind speeds may be inferred from turbine parameters such as, for example, blade pitch, turbine power, and so on. In a further embodiment, meteorological masts may used to measure wind speeds at a single location in the wind farm <b>12</b> wherefrom wind speeds at individual wind turbine generators may be determined using wind distribution data. A processor <b>64</b> is utilized to compute temporal averages of the sensed wind speeds at different points in time. In one embodiment, the temporal averages include rolling averages of sensed wind speeds for one or more moving time windows of different durations. As an example, rolling averages may be computed for moving time windows of 10 minutes, 30 seconds and 3 seconds. The processor <b>64</b> is configured to generate a signal indicative of a request to change operational state of the wind turbine generators when temporally averaged wind speeds approach the protective wind speed limit, and communicate the same to the central controller <b>51</b> via communication circuitry <b>66</b>. The processor <b>64</b> is also in communication with various turbine and generator controls <b>67</b>, such as pitch control system, torque or power control systems, and so forth, and is operable to alter the operational state of the wind turbine generator based on signals received from the central controller <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As discussed above, the wind farm control system <b>50</b> includes controller <b>51</b> and power sensors <b>52</b>. The controller <b>51</b> comprises a memory <b>68</b>, and a processing unit <b>70</b> including a ramp rate estimation module <b>72</b> and a sequencing module <b>74</b>. The ramp rate estimation module <b>72</b> and the sequencing module <b>74</b> typically comprise machine-readable instructions implemented by a processor, such as a programmable logic controller (PLC). The memory <b>68</b> records temporal data corresponding to collective power output of the wind farm <b>12</b> sensed by the power sensors <b>52</b> at different points in time. The ramp rate estimation module <b>72</b> includes an algorithm adapted to compute temporal averages of power ramp rate of the wind farm <b>12</b> based on sensed power output of the wind farm <b>12</b>. The temporal average may include, for example a rolling average of the rate of change of power output of the wind farm over a moving time window of fixed duration. In one embodiment, an instantaneous rate of change of power output may be established by computing a difference between power outputs at adjacent points in time and dividing this difference by the incremental difference in time between the adjacent points in time. Instantaneous rates of change of power may show abrupt variations in time. A rolling average is generally computed to filter out these variations and establish a uniformly varying rate of change.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sequencing module <b>74</b> comprises an algorithm adapted to sequence the requests received from the wind turbine generators based on operating conditions of the wind turbine generators and the instantaneous rolling average of the wind farm power ramp rate computed by the ramp rate estimation module <b>72</b>. Input to the sequencing module <b>74</b> may comprise operating conditions of individual wind turbine generators including wind speed, turbine speed, turbine power, rate of change of turbine speed, rate of change of turbine power, blade pitch angle, projected wind speed, and so forth communicated by respective turbine level control systems <b>58</b>. The sequencing algorithm is discussed in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The wind farm control system <b>50</b> may further include communication circuitry <b>76</b> adapted to communicate with the wind turbine generators via communication links <b>54</b>, and a user interface <b>78</b> including, for example a display of operational status of the wind turbine generators.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method <b>84</b> of operating a wind farm according to aspects of the present technique. The method <b>84</b> includes monitoring wind speed at individual wind turbine generators (block <b>86</b>) and transmitting signals from the wind turbine generators to the wind farm control system based on the monitored wind speeds (block <b>88</b>). The signals are then sequenced by the central controller of the wind farm control system based on operating conditions of individual wind turbine generators (block <b>90</b>). The method <b>84</b> further includes monitoring ramp rate of collective power output of the wind farm (block <b>92</b>) and controlling the power ramp down rate of the wind farm based on a maximum specified power ramp down rate via coordinating of operational states of the wind turbine generators (block <b>94</b>). Block <b>94</b> includes authorizing one or more wind turbine generators to shut down or curtail power output, while queuing up signals received from other wind turbine generators, such that power ramp down rate of the wind farm does not exceed the maximum specified power ramp down rate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.4</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method <b>96</b> for controlling rate of change of power output of a wind farm. The method <b>96</b> includes monitoring wind speed at individual wind turbine generators by sensing wind speeds at different points in time (block <b>98</b>) and computing rolling averages of the sensed wind speeds over one or more time windows (block <b>100</b>). Block <b>100</b> may include computing rolling averages for time windows of 10 minutes, 30 seconds and 3 seconds duration. At block <b>102</b>, the rolling averages of the wind speed for various time windows are compared to protective wind speed limit values, the protective wind speed limits being different for time windows of different durations. In an exemplary embodiment, the protective wind speed limit for the 10 minute, 30 second and 3 second windows are respectively 25 m/s, 28 m/s, 30 m/s. At block <b>102</b>, if rolling averages of the wind speed for at least one time window is greater than the protective wind speed limit for that window, the protection function requires the wind turbine generator to trip or shut down (block <b>103</b>) as discussed above. At block <b>104</b>, the rolling averages of the wind speed for different time windows are compared to predetermined set points, which are lower than the protective wind speed limits of the respective time windows. For example, in the above embodiment, the predetermined set points for the 10 minute, 30 second and 3 second time windows may be respectively 24 m/s, 26.5 m/s and 28 m/s. If rolling averages of the wind speed for at least one time window is greater than the predetermined set point for that window, a state-change request is communicated by the wind turbine generator to the wind farm control system (block <b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, the predetermined set points are chosen to be lower than the protective wind speed limits to enable the wind turbine generators to anticipate a prospective high speed shutdown condition. This provides sufficient time for the wind farm control system <b>50</b> to coordinate a shutdown or a power curtailment sequence before individual wind turbine generators trip independently because of their protection function.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The method <b>96</b> further includes monitoring rate of change of power output of the wind farm by sensing collective power output of the wind farm (<b>108</b>) and computing a temporal average of power ramp down rate of the wind farm (block <b>110</b>). Requests received from the wind turbine generators are then sequenced based on operating conditions of the wind turbine generators (block <b>112</b>). At different points in time, the monitored rate of change of power output of the wind farm is compared to a maximum specified power ramp down rate (block <b>114</b>). At block <b>116</b>, an authorization signal to grant a request for a shut down or a curtailment of power output is generated only if, at block <b>114</b>, the rate of change of power output of the wind farm is determined to be lower than the maximum specified power ramp down rate. If the maximum specified power ramp down rate is exceeded, the central controller <b>51</b> generally waits until sufficient time has elapsed such that the maximum power ramp down rate will be respected, before granting the requests by the wind turbine generators to shut down or curtail power output. If average wind speed at the wind turbine generator during this waiting period exceeds the protective wind speed limit, the protection function requires the wind turbine generator to shut down on its own even without authorization from the central controller <b>51</b></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once an authorization signal is generated, individual wind turbine generators may shut down (block <b>103</b>) or curtail its power output (block <b>118</b>). A shutdown operation may be carried out by either of the techniques discussed earlier, or any combinations thereof. Once shut down due to high wind speed conditions, a wind turbine generator is generally not restarted until the average wind speed at the wind turbine generator is lower than a predetermined lower set point. For example, in the above described embodiment, once shut down, the wind turbine is not restarted until a 5 minute rolling average wind speed is less than 22 m/s. In certain embodiments, the shutdown sequence may be halted for some time, and then followed by further shutdown sequences or restart sequences dependent on wind characteristics. In still further embodiments, a shutdown sequence may be initiated by the wind farm control system due to measured or forecast high winds.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exemplary graphical illustration showing the variation in the number of state-change requests and the power output of the wind farm with time at high wind speeds. Curve <b>120</b> generally represents the variation in the number of state-change requests with time and curve <b>122</b> represents the corresponding variation in the collective power output of the wind farm. As illustrated, power output of the wind farm is generally constant with increasing wind speed until time T<sub>1</sub>. This is around the time when one or more of the change requests begin to be granted. Thereafter, slope of the curve <b>122</b> generally decreases, signifying a decrease in the power of the wind farm. By time T<sub>2</sub>, a sufficient number of state-change requests are granted to cause the power output of the wind farm to decrease. Beyond time T<sub>2</sub>, the curve <b>122</b> exhibits a negative slope, which, in accordance with the present technique is controlled not to exceed a maximum specified negative ramp rate. By proper sequencing of the of the state-change requests, power ramp down rate of the wind farm can be maintained around a desired value specified by utility requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present technique thus provides an efficient control of power ramp-down rate of a wind farm during high wind speed conditions, while maximizing energy capture during the shut down or state-change sequence. Aspects of the present technique provide a power-down sequencing and optimization algorithm that determines when an individual turbine can shutdown or curtail its power output level so that aggregate power ramp down rate objective is enforced. The present technique may also be designed to meet grid code/utility requirements for coordinated shutdown during high wind conditions.</p>
