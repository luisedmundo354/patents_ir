<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Discodermolide, more specifically referred to as (+)-discodermolide, is a microtubule-stabilizing drug which is found naturally in the Caribbean sponge <i>Discodermia dissolute</i>. Discodermolide has attracted widespread attention because of its known potent inhibition of tumor cell growth. The structure of discodermolide is shown below:</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002">
<img id="EMI-C00002" he="35.31mm" wi="75.27mm" file="US07297807-20071120-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">As evidenced by the structure above, discodermolide is a structurally complex molecule. Contributing to its complexity are thirteen chiral centers, grouped as a stereotetrad (four contiguous chiral centers, C-2 to C-5)), an isolated chiral center (C-7), a stereotriad (three contiguous chiral centers (C-10 to C-12), and a stereopentad (five contiguous chiral centers, C-16 to C-20), and four olefinic bonds, three of which have specific geometry. The C-10 to C-12 stereotriad has syn, anti relative stereochemistry. This stereotriad (syn, anti) is also found within the stereotetrad and within the stereopentad.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The isolation of discodermolide from natural sources has not resulted in commercially meaningful quantities of the drug. Accordingly, there remains a continuing effort to find an efficient synthesis of discodermolide.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Because of the structural complexity of discodermolide, its synthesis has proven to be a formidable task. The synthesis of multigram quantities of discodermolide reported by Novartis in March 2004 required more than 20 steps in the longest linear sequence (more than 30 steps in total) and twenty months of work. See M. Freemantle, “Scaled-Up Synthesis of Discodermolide,” <i>Chemical </i>&amp; <i>Engineering News</i>, Mar. 1, 2004, pp. 33-35.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The Novartis synthesis as reported, like other published total syntheses, was based on the elaboration of the well-known chiral fungal product, methyl (R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionate (the “Roche ester”), as the source of chirality for all three key intermediates.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003">
<img id="EMI-C00003" he="19.81mm" wi="21.59mm" file="US07297807-20071120-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Recently, syntheses of key intermediates in which the source of chirality was a chiral auxiliary were reported. See Dias, Luiz C.; Bau, Rosana Z.; de Sousa, Marcio A.; Zukerman-Schpector, J. “High 1,5-Anti Stereoinduction in Boron-Mediated Aldol Reactions of Methyl Ketones” Organic Letters (2002), 4(24), 4325-4327 and Day, Billy W.; Kangani, Cyrous O.; Avor, Kwasi S. “Convenient syntheses of (2R,3S,4R)-3-(tert-butyldimethylsilanyloxy)-2,4-dimethyl-5-oxopentanoic acid methoxymethylamide from methacrolein. Preparation of C1-C7 and C17-C24 fragments of (+)-discodermolide.” Tetrahedron: Asymmetry (2002), 13(11), 1161-1165. This approach was incorporated in the Novartis scale-up studies; see Loiseleur, Olivier; Koch, Guido; Wagner, Trixie. “A Practical Building Block for the Synthesis of Discodermolide.” Organic Process Research &amp; Development (2004), 8(4), 597-602 Also, recently, Myles and coworkers at Kosan prepared Smith's key intermediate, the common precursor “CP” by chemical modification of a fermentation product from a genetically engineered <i>Streptomyces</i>, see Burlingame, Mark A.; Mendoza, Esteban; Ashley, Gary W.; Myles, David C. “Synthesis of discodermolide intermediates from engineered polyketides” Tetrahedron Letters (2006), 47(7), 1209-1211.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">There are other biologically active compounds which share some of the structural features of discodermolide. For example, the calyculins, natural products isolated from the marine sponge <i>Discodermia calyx </i>are inhibitors of serine-threonine phosphatase. Calyculins A and B are shown below. The encircled part of the structure shows a stereotetrad, that contains an anti, anti stereotriad at C-10 to C-12.</p>

<img id="EMI-C00004" he="66.21mm" wi="104.65mm" file="US07297807-20071120-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">Likewise, the macrolide antitumor agent dictyostatin contains two syn, anti stereotriads, encircled in the picture, one of which is part of a stereotetrad.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005">

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">Accordingly, there is a clear need for more efficient ways to produce polypropionate antibiotics in which there are stereotriad regions. Such improved syntheses can be realized by, for example, providing new chemical intermediates. Particularly beneficial for this purpose are new intermediates which conveniently provide the anti, syn stereotriad that is contained, for example, in the C8 to C14 portion of discodermolide. Also particularly beneficial are schemes that rely on asymmetric catalysis, rather than on expensive chiral starting materials such as the Roche ester or on chiral auxiliaries for the introduction of chirality.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0025"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00008" num="00008">

</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">In one embodiment, R<sup>1 </sup>in formula (1) represents hydrogen (H).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">In another embodiment, R<sup>1 </sup>represents a protecting group. The protecting group can be essentially any group suitable for the protection of an alcohol group as known in the art. In this specification, the phrase “protecting group” indicates any functionality that is used to replace a hydrogen on an alcohol and which can be removed with restoration of the hydrogen without altering the structure of the remainder of the molecule. Some examples are given below, but they are not meant to be inclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">An example of a class of suitable protecting groups for R<sup>1 </sup>includes the class of silyl protecting groups. The class of silyl protecting groups, including silyl ether protecting groups, can be represented according to the formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>—Si(O<sub>x</sub>R<sup>4</sup>)(O<sub>y</sub>R<sup>5</sup>)(O<sub>z</sub>R<sup>6a</sup>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">In the formula above for silyl ether protecting groups, R<sup>4</sup>, R<sup>5</sup>, and R<sup>6</sup>a each independently represents an alkyl group or an aryl group. The alkyl groups are preferably linear or branched, preferably having one to four carbon atoms, typically methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, and tertiary butyl. The aryl groups of R<sup>7 </sup>are preferably phenyl, pyridinyl, pyrrolyl, or furanyl.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">The subscripts x, y, and z independently represent 0 or 1. When x, y, or z is 0, the oxygen atom to which the subscript is associated is absent. When x, y, or z is 1, the oxygen atom to which the subscript is associated, is present.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">Any two alkyl groups of O<sub>x</sub>R<sup>4</sup>, O<sub>y</sub>R<sup>5</sup>, and O<sub>z</sub>R<sup>6a</sup>, for example, R<sup>4 </sup>and R<sup>5</sup>, are optionally connected to form a silicon-containing ring. The carbon-carbon bond formed accompanies removal of a hydrogen atom from each carbon atom joined. The values of x and y are preferably both 0.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">The size of the silicon-containing ring resulting from interconnection of two alkyl groups of R<sup>4</sup>, R<sup>5</sup>, and R<sup>6a </sup>depends on the size of the R groups that form the ring, and the value of x, y, and, as the case may be, z. Preferably, the ring includes two to six ring carbon atoms in addition to the silicon atom. For example, in one embodiment, R<sup>4 </sup>and R<sup>5 </sup>are both methyl groups and x and y are both 0. The methyl groups can be connected via their carbon atoms to form a silacyclopropane ring. In another embodiment, R<sup>4 </sup>and R<sup>5 </sup>are both ethyl groups and x and y are both 0. Depending on the connecting carbon atoms chosen, the ethyl groups can be connected to form a silacyclopentane ring or a 2-methylsilacyclobutane ring.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">Some examples of silyl protecting groups according to the formula above for silyl ether protecting groups wherein x, y, and z are all 0 include triethylsilyl, tri-(n-propyl)silyl, triisopropylsilyl, tri-(n-butyl)silyl, triisobutylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS), t-butyldiphenylsilyl, phenyldimethylsilyl, methyldiphenylsilyl, triphenylsilyl.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">Some examples of silyl protecting groups according to the formula above wherein at least one of x, y, and z is 1 include trimethoxysilyl, dimethoxymethylsilyl, methoxydimethylsilyl, ethoxydimethylsilyl, methoxydiethylsilyl, isopropoxydimethylsilyl, phenoxydimethylsilyl, phenoxydiethylsilyl, methyldiphenoxysilyl, [2,4,6-tri-(t-butyl)phenoxy]dimethylsilyl, t-butoxydimethylsilyl, t-butoxydiphenylsilyl, (t-butyl)(methoxy)phenylsilyl, and methoxydiphenylsilyl.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">Another example of a class of useful protecting groups for compounds of formula 1 is the acetal/ketal class. This class of protecting groups can be represented according to the formula:</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">R<sup>6 </sup>preferably represents an alkyl group optionally substituted with an aryl group; R<sup>7 </sup>preferably represents hydrogen, an alkyl group, or an aryl group; and R<sup>8 </sup>preferably represents hydrogen or an alkyl group. The alkyl groups of R<sup>6</sup>, R<sup>7</sup>, and R<sup>8 </sup>are linear or branched, preferably having one to four carbon atoms, typically methyl or ethyl. The alkyl groups of R<sup>6 </sup>and R<sup>7 </sup>may be joined to form a five or six member saturated ring. The aryl substituent of R<sup>6 </sup>and the aryl group of R<sup>7 </sup>are preferably phenyl, pyridinyl, pyrrolyl, or furanyl.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">Some preferred acetal/ketal protecting groups include methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, and benzyloxymethyl. Some additional protecting groups in this class include p-methoxybenzyloxymethyl and beta-trimethylsilyloxyethoxymethyl (SEM) groups.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">Another example of a class of suitable protecting groups includes arylmethyl protecting groups, which protect a hydroxyl group by converting it to an arylmethyl ether. The aryl group may be phenyl, pyridinyl, pyrrolyl, or furanyl, optionally substituted with methoxy, ethoxy, nitro, or halo (F, Cl, Br, or I). Some preferred members of this class of protecting groups include benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, and p-ethoxybenzyl.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0043">The leaving group is essentially any group capable of being replaced by a carbon substituent under conditions to which the protecting group is stable. For example, the leaving group can be a halogen atom. Some suitable halogen atoms include chloride, bromide, and iodide.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">Alternatively, the leaving group can be organic in nature, such as, for example, a sulfonate ester group or a phosphorus ester group.

In order to produce discodermolide, the compounds according to formula (1) must be treated with other compounds which provide the C1-C7 and C15-C24 portions of discodermolide. A suitable protocol for doing so is shown in schemes 1-3 below.</p>
