<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to surgical stapling apparatus, and more particularly, to surgical apparatus for performing sequential operations such as tissue clamping, staple forming and/or tissue cutting.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Surgical stapling apparatus are known wherein tissue is first grasped or clamped between opposing jaw structure and then fastened by means of fasteners. In some instruments a knife is provided to cut tissue which has been joined. The fasteners are typically in the form of surgical staples. However, two part polymeric type fasteners are also known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Instruments for this purpose can comprise two elongated fingers which are respectively used to capture or clamp tissue. Typically, one of the fingers carries a disposable cartridge housing wherein a plurality of staples are arranged in at least two lateral rows while the other finger comprises an anvil for curling the staple legs into a hook-like configuration upon their being driven against the anvil. The stapling operation is effected by a pusher which travels longitudinally along the cartridge carrying finger, with the pusher acting upon the staples to place rows of staples in body tissue. A knife may be optionally positioned in such a manner so as to operate sequentially immediately behind the pusher, and laterally positioned between the staple rows to longitudinally cut and/or open the stapled tissue between the rows of staples. Such instruments are disclosed in Bobrov et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 3,079,606) and Green (U.S. Pat. No. 3,490,675). These instruments comprise apparatus for simultaneously making a longitudinal incision and applying a row of staples on both sides of the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A later development disclosed in Green (U.S. Pat. No. 3,499,591) applies a double row of staples on each side of the incision. This is accomplished by a cartridge assembly wherein a cam member moves within a guide path between two sets of staggered staple carrying grooves. Staple drive members located within the grooves each have two staple pusher plates, and sloping surfaces disposed within the guide path so as to be contacted by the longitudinally moving cam and be driven along the groove to effect ejection of two staples.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cartridge assemblies typically come in a plurality of sizes, each varying in both length and number of staples contained therein. Depending on the procedure to be performed, the surgeon must select the appropriate cartridge assembly. No provision is currently available to adjust the firing means of the instrument itself so that a wide variety of staple driving sequences may be accomplished using a single staple cartridge assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The instruments described above were all designed to be used in surgical procedures wherein surgeons have direct manual access to the operation site. However, in endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures surgery is performed through a small incision or through narrow cannulae inserted through small entrance wounds in the skin. In order to address the specific needs of endoscopic and/or laparoscopic surgical procedures, an endoscopic surgical stapling apparatus such as that shown in Green et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,715) has been developed. This apparatus is well suited for such procedures and incorporates a distal end having an anvil and staple cartridge assembly and a manually operated handle assembly interconnected by an endoscopic portion which permits the instrument to be inserted into a cannula and be remotely operated by the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a surgical apparatus that provides a full range of remotely actuated movements to the distal working members of the apparatus to facilitate interaction with and manipulation of tissue.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The surgical instrument in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is a surgical stapling apparatus which is adapted for placing one or more longitudinal rows of staples. This apparatus may further include a knife for making an incision in body tissue between the rows of staples. The latter configuration may find particular use of adjoining two hollow organs or in removing an organ, such as the appendix, the gallbladder, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment of the subject invention the endoscopic stapler comprises a frame portion, an elongated tubular body portion extending from the frame portion and adapted for receiving an articulating cartridge assembly. The articulating cartridge assembly includes a cartridge mounting portion removably maintained in a distal end portion of the tubular body portion and a cartridge housing portion which is pivotally connected to the cartridge mounting portion. A cable loop assembly is associated with the tubular body portion of the instrument for effectuating the articulation of the cartridge housing portion relative to the cartridge mounting portion of the cartridge assembly. The cable loop assembly includes a cable member, a pivot block member mounted for rotation in a distal end portion on the tubular body portion about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis thereof, and a rotation control member operatively associated with the tubular body portion of the apparatus for manipulating the cable loop assembly. A cartridge element, which includes a plurality of surgical staples slidably mounted therein, and having a tissue engaging surface, is receivable within the cartridge housing portion of the cartridge assembly. An anvil member is also provided which has a staple forming surface formed thereon and which is mounted adjacent the cartridge housing portion of the cartridge assembly such that the anvil member is movable between an open position and a closed position wherein the staple forming surface is in close cooperative alignment with the tissue engaging surface of the cartridge element.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The apparatus further comprises means associated with the tubular body portion for moving the anvil member between the open and the closed positions, and means for ejecting the surgical staples from the cartridge element in such a manner so as to cause the staples to engage and form on the staple forming surface of the anvil member. The means for moving the anvil member comprises a linkage mechanism associated with the frame portion and extending into the tubular body portion to a cable mechanism. The cable mechanism includes a cable member mounted at a leading end thereof to the linkage mechanism and at a trailing end thereof to the cartridge housing portion of the cartridge assembly. The anvil member is operatively associated with the cable member intermediate the ends thereof. The means for ejecting the surgical fasteners comprises a plurality of pusher elements in abutment with the surgical fasteners, and at least one cam bar for actuating the pusher elements. The cam bar is mounted in an adapter which translates within the cartridge assembly. In one embodiment of the cartridge assembly, the cam bar is fixedly mounted in the adapter while in another embodiment the cam bar is freely movable within the adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The articulating cartridge assembly of the subject invention is also provided with bearing means for guiding the translation of the cam bars as they traverse the cartridge assembly at such times when the cartridge housing portion of the cartridge assembly is articulated relative to the cartridge mounting portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another preferred embodiment of the surgical apparatus of the subject invention, the instrument includes a fastener applying assembly having a base portion and fastener applying means which include a staple cartridge housing and an anvil member. First means are provided for effectuating articulation of the fastener applying assembly between a first position generally in alignment with the longitudinal axis of the elongated body of the instrument and a second position angularly disposed with respect to the longitudinal axis of the elongated body. Second means are provided for effectuating rotation of the fastener applying assembly about the longitudinal axis defined by the elongated body relative to the frame portion. Third means are provided for effectuating independent rotation of the fastener applying means relative to the base portion of the fastener applying assembly to further increase the range of operability of the surgical apparatus of the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The surgical apparatus of the subject invention may further comprise sealing means associated with the tubular body portion of the instrument for prohibiting the egress of insulation gas therethrough during surgical procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The surgical instrument may be constructed either as a reusable unit or as a single use, disposable unit or, alternatively may be formed with a reusable handle portion and replaceable body portions and/or staple carrying cartridges.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further features of the invention, its nature, and various advantages will become more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following detailed description of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is generally accepted that endoscopic procedures are more common than laparoscopic procedures. Accordingly, the present invention shall be discussed in terms of endoscopic procedures and apparatus. However, use herein of terms such as “endoscopic”, “endoscopically” and “endoscopic portion”, among others, should not be construed to limit the present invention to a stapling and cutting apparatus for use only in conjunction with an endoscopic tube. On the contrary, it is believed that the present invention may find use in any procedure where access is limited to a small incision, including but not limited to laparoscopic procedures. Also, as used herein the terms “fasteners” and “staples” shall be treated equivalently. Unless otherwise stated, the term “cartridge assembly” shall include at least the cartridge itself and staples or fasteners and staple drive members disposed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the drawings and the description which follows, as is customary, the term “proximal” refers to the end which is closest to the operator while the term “distal” will refer to the end which is furthest from the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a self contained gas powered endoscopic surgical apparatus constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention is illustrated and is designated generally by reference numeral <b>50</b>. Surgical apparatus <b>50</b> essentially comprises a frame portion <b>52</b> and an elongated portion <b>54</b>. An anvil member <b>56</b> and an articulating cartridge assembly <b>58</b> are preferably removably mounted in a distal end portion <b>60</b> of elongated portion <b>54</b>. Anvil member <b>56</b> and cartridge assembly <b>58</b> are manually controlled by means of an articulating handle <b>62</b> associated with frame portion <b>52</b>. More particularly, handle <b>62</b> interconnects with anvil member <b>56</b> by means of a linkage and cable assembly which is associated with the elongated portion <b>54</b> such that when handle <b>62</b> is articulated from an open position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to a closed position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), anvil member <b>56</b> is moved into close approximation with the articulating cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. This operation will be discussed in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the frame portion <b>52</b> of surgical apparatus <b>50</b> includes opposed first and second housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> which enclose a pneumatic system designated generally by reference numeral <b>68</b>. The distal end portion of articulating handle member <b>62</b> is pivotally connected to a clamp tube <b>70</b> at a pivot point <b>72</b>. Longitudinal grooves <b>74</b> are formed in the opposed first and second housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> adjacent pivot point <b>72</b> for slidably receiving molded shuttles <b>76</b> which are attached to the articulating handle member <b>62</b> at pivot point <b>72</b>. The molded shuttles <b>76</b> are pivotally connected to either side of the pivot point <b>72</b> on the distal end of handle <b>62</b> and function to guide the distal end thereof in a longitudinally distal direction as handle <b>62</b> is articulated.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A pair of articulating links <b>78</b> interconnect an intermediate portion of handle member <b>62</b> to a pair of projections <b>80</b> formed on an upper surface of housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> respectively. A handle return spring <b>82</b> extends between handle <b>62</b> and housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> by means of a pair of spring anchor pins <b>84</b>, one of which is disposed in handle <b>62</b> and the other extending between projections <b>80</b>. Anchor pins <b>84</b> also serve to pivotally connect articulating links <b>78</b> to projections <b>80</b>. This spring <b>82</b> assists in returning handle <b>62</b> from its closed position to its open position.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The proximal end of articulating handle <b>62</b> is preferably diagonally formed away from housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> so as to enable the surgeon to more easily release the handle <b>62</b> from its closed position. This is done by placing the hand under the proximal end of handle <b>62</b> and lifting. A texturized or serrated portion <b>86</b> may be advantageously formed on an under surface of the proximal end of handle <b>62</b> to enhance the gripping thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Pneumatic system <b>68</b> is wholly contained within housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> and includes a container <b>88</b> of relatively low pressure gas longitudinally slidably mounted therein. The pressure of the gas in container <b>88</b> during operation of the stapler is typically less than about 200 p.s.i.g. and preferably in the range from about 80 p.s.i.g. to about 160 p.s.i.g. Any suitable non-toxic gas can be used including but not limited to halogenated hydrocarbons which are gaseous at room temperature, e.g., fluorinated hydrocarbons such as Freon 12 or chlorinated hydrocarbons such as Freon 152A. Container <b>88</b> dispenses the relatively low pressure gas through stem <b>90</b>, valve <b>92</b>, and gas tube <b>94</b> when the firing trigger <b>96</b> is depressed. Spring <b>97</b> is positioned between container <b>88</b> and valve <b>92</b> and functions to hold the container <b>88</b> in a position spaced from valve <b>92</b>. Valve <b>92</b> is fixed within housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> and is longitudinally adjustable by means of set screw <b>93</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). This feature permits the position of valve <b>92</b> to be longitudinally changed to compensate for manufacturers' variations in length among containers <b>88</b> between a distal end and the proximal end of stem <b>90</b>. A pneumatic actuator <b>98</b> is disposed above container <b>88</b> within housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>. Actuator <b>98</b> includes a pneumatic cylinder <b>100</b> which is held in place by opposed pins <b>99</b>. Cylinder <b>100</b> is substantially closed at the proximal end thereof but for a ferrule <b>102</b> extending therethrough and is open at its distal end, wherein a pneumatic piston <b>104</b> is mounted for reciprocal motion therein on an axis which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b>. Cylinder <b>100</b> is preferably circular in transverse cross-section, however, other configurations would function acceptably well.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Piston <b>104</b> is pneumatically sealed to cylinder <b>100</b> by an O-ring <b>106</b> molded of polyethylene or the like. Gas dispensed from container <b>88</b> is supplied to pneumatic actuator <b>98</b> via gas tube <b>94</b> which admits the gas to cylinder <b>100</b> through ferrule <b>102</b> behind piston <b>104</b> to drive piston <b>104</b> distally in the cylinder <b>100</b>. The distal end of piston <b>104</b> is adapted to engage the firing mechanism of the surgical apparatus as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2–10</figref>, firing trigger <b>96</b> is pivotally mounted in a proximal end of housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> by a pivot pin <b>108</b>. A spring <b>110</b> is positioned adjacent pin <b>108</b> which serves to bias firing trigger <b>96</b> proximally into the prefiring position. A trigger rod <b>112</b> extends distally from firing trigger <b>96</b> in a longitudinal direction so as to engage a piston slide <b>114</b> which is positioned in a lower portion of piston <b>104</b>. Piston slide <b>114</b> comprises a substantially U-shaped channel which fits into a corresponding groove <b>116</b> formed in piston <b>104</b>. Piston slide <b>114</b> is spring loaded in a proximal direction by a spring <b>118</b> and includes a transverse projection <b>120</b> on a lower distal end thereof which engages the distal end of trigger rod <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A rocking lever <b>120</b> is pivotally mounted on a transverse slide pin <b>122</b> and is adapted for transverse movement relative to slide pin <b>122</b> between an engaged position prior to firing (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5–7</figref>) and a disengaged position when articulating handle <b>62</b> is open (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). A cam slide <b>124</b> is vertically mounted in first housing member <b>64</b> for reciprocal movement between an upper position and lower position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, respectively). Cam slide <b>124</b> functions to move rocking lever <b>120</b> between the engaged position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the disengaged position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Thus, until articulating handle member <b>62</b> is closed, causing cam slide <b>124</b> to move rocking lever <b>120</b> into the engaged position, surgical instrument <b>50</b> cannot be fired.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Cam slide <b>124</b> is normally biased in its upper disengaged position by a cam slide spring <b>126</b> which is mounted in vertical groove <b>128</b> formed in the first housing member <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). In this upper position, cam slide <b>124</b> extends upward beyond first housing member <b>64</b> to engage articulating handle member <b>62</b> as it is moved to a closed position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). Cam slide <b>124</b> further includes a camming surface <b>130</b> which contacts a corresponding camming surface of a camming block <b>132</b> which is mounted on slide pin <b>122</b>. Camming block <b>132</b> is loaded against cam slide <b>124</b> by a slide spring <b>134</b> and moves rocking lever <b>120</b> transversely on slide pin <b>122</b> between an engaged position and a disengaged position. As articulating handle <b>62</b> is compressed toward housing members <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> in the direction of arrow <b>135</b> it contacts cam slide <b>124</b>, moving it downward, and causing camming surface <b>130</b> to move camming block <b>132</b> and rocking lever <b>120</b> transversely into an engaged position in alignment with piston <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>–<b>7</b> and <b>9</b>, once the articulating handle <b>62</b> has been fully compressed, rocking lever <b>120</b> is disposed in alignment with piston slide <b>114</b> and can be pivotally moved about transverse slide pin <b>122</b> to engage a pusher disk <b>136</b> disposed at the distal end of container <b>88</b>. When the instrument is in the clamped configuration, depression of firing trigger <b>96</b> moves trigger rod <b>112</b> distally in the longitudinal direction causing piston slide <b>144</b> to engage and pivot rocking lever <b>120</b> which, in turn, engages pusher disk <b>136</b> and moves container <b>88</b> into contact with valve <b>92</b> to dispense gas and propel piston <b>104</b> in the distal direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9–11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As piston <b>104</b> moves distally, rocking lever <b>120</b> remains in its pivoted firing position by contact with the bottom surface of piston <b>104</b>. A gap <b>138</b> is formed in the bottom surface of piston <b>104</b> adjacent the proximal end thereof which effectively allows rocking lever <b>120</b> to disengage from piston <b>104</b> and return to a position wherein container <b>88</b> is released from engagement with valve <b>92</b>, thereby stopping the flow of gas into pneumatic cylinder <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A pair of return springs <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> disposed in elongated portion <b>54</b> drive piston <b>104</b> back to its initial prefired position. A camming surface <b>144</b> is formed in a distal end of gap <b>138</b> which causes rocking lever <b>120</b> to move out of engagement with piston <b>104</b> as it returns and rocking lever <b>120</b> moves to its original prefired position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The articulating cartridge assembly <b>58</b> of the subject invention comprises a forward housing portion <b>270</b> and a rearward housing portion <b>272</b>. Forward housing <b>270</b> is defined by a channel structure of substantially rectangular cross-section having opposed side walls <b>274</b> and <b>276</b> and a bottom wall <b>278</b>. This channel structure constitutes the cartridge receiving portion and is dimensioned to receive a cartridge <b>280</b>. A longitudinal groove structure <b>282</b> is defined in cartridge <b>280</b> for receiving and guiding knife <b>240</b> therethrough. A plurality of stems <b>283</b> extend downwardly from the undersurface of cartridge <b>280</b> for engagement in a plurality of corresponding apertures <b>287</b> formed in the bottom wall <b>278</b> of forward housing <b>270</b>. A plurality of pusher elements <b>284</b> are disposed in cartridge <b>280</b> in abutment with a plurality of corresponding staples <b>285</b>. The staples <b>285</b> are advantageously arranged in six longitudinal rows with three rows positioned on either side of groove structure <b>282</b>. See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,049 to Green, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, two pairs of longitudinal slots are formed in the cartridge housing <b>280</b> and are adapted to receive a pair of dual cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> therein. Cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> each serve to drive three corresponding longitudinal rows of staples <b>285</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are each provided with a cam surface <b>290</b> in an upper distal end thereof and an overhanging ledge <b>292</b> with vertical surface <b>294</b> in a lower distal end. This overhanging ledge <b>292</b> is dimensioned to extend into the longitudinal slots formed in cartridge <b>280</b> to a point wherein the vertical surface <b>294</b> of overhanging ledge <b>292</b> drops down and abuts the forward edge <b>296</b> of the forward housing portion <b>270</b> cartridge assembly <b>58</b> when cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> move to their distal fired position. At their proximal ends, cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are provided with hook structure <b>298</b> for releasably engaging a cam bar adapter <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>19</b>, and <b>23</b>, one embodiment of cam bar adapter <b>300</b> in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. Cam bar adapter <b>300</b> comprises a forward section <b>302</b> and a rearward section <b>304</b>. Forward section <b>302</b> is substantially rectangular in configuration and has a central longitudinal groove <b>306</b> formed therein and dimensioned to receive the longitudinal groove structure <b>282</b> on cartridge <b>280</b> when cam bar adapter <b>300</b> is urged to its forwardmost position. Flanges <b>308</b> and shelves <b>310</b> function to removably retain the proximal ends of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>. The rearward section <b>304</b> of cam bar adapter <b>300</b> is rectangular in configuration with projections <b>312</b> formed in the proximal end thereof. The rearward section is dimensioned to be receivable within the slot formed in forked portion <b>194</b> in channel member <b>192</b>. Projections <b>312</b> are dimensioned to engage ramping surface <b>198</b> so as to allow forked portion <b>194</b> to ride up and over projections <b>312</b> when it is moved in the distal direction. A vertical bore <b>314</b> and a longitudinal groove <b>316</b> are formed in the rearward section <b>304</b> of cam bar adapter <b>300</b> which retain and hold the shank portion <b>315</b> of knife <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Although cam bar adapter <b>300</b> is effective to maintain cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> and to transport the same through cartridge assembly <b>58</b>, it may be desirable to provide a cam bar adapter which enables the proximal ends of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> to move freely in a transverse direction while being effectively maintained in a desired longitudinal position. Free mounting of the cam bars provides several advantages over fixed mounting which advantages will be discussed in detail hereinbelow. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20–22</figref> illustrate this embodiment of the cam bar adapter and is designated generally by reference numeral <b>320</b>. Cam bar adapter <b>320</b> comprises a cam bar support fixture <b>322</b> and a housing structure <b>324</b>. Support fixture <b>322</b> is defined by a substantially L-shaped structure having an elongated leg portion <b>326</b> and a transverse leg portion <b>328</b>. A slot <b>330</b> is provided in leg portion <b>326</b> for receiving the proximal end of dual cam bar <b>286</b> and a similar slot <b>322</b> is provided in leg portion <b>328</b> for receiving the proximal end of dual cam bar <b>288</b>. The staggered mounting of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> in L-shaped support structure <b>322</b> advantageously positions cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> to more effectively eject the staples from cartridge <b>285</b>. Support fixture <b>322</b> is dimensioned so as to fit within a rectangular channel <b>334</b> defined within housing structure <b>324</b>. Channel <b>334</b> accommodates support fixture <b>302</b> in such a manner so that it can move freely therein.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The advantages of freely mounting cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are best explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>. Cam bar adapter <b>300</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, wherein the respective proximal portions of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are fixedly mounted. Upon articulating the forward housing <b>270</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b>, cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are compressed by opposed bearing members <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> disposed in forward housing <b>270</b>. The compression of the cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> causes a buckling effect at the central spans thereof. The deflection is accentuated because the proximal end portions of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are fixed in cam bar adapter <b>300</b>. In contrast, if cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are mounted in cam bar adapter <b>320</b> such that the respective proximal end portions thereof are maintained in the L-shaped support fixture <b>322</b> which moves freely within channel <b>334</b> defined in housing structure <b>324</b>, the degree of deflection or buckling across the central spans of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> is substantially decreased. By reducing the degree of deflection across the spans of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b>, the amount of force needed to drive cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> is also decreased. Moreover, the amount of pressure required to be released by the pneumatic system for driving cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> through a complete stroke will be less when the respective proximal end portions of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are mounted freely rather than fixedly in a cam bar adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The cam bars are often made of stainless steel, however, it has been found that forming the cam bars from a shape memory alloy comprising, for example, a composition of nickel and titanium (such a composition is available from Raychem Corp., Menlo Park, Calif. under the trade name TINEL), rather than stainless steel, will reduce the amount of force required to drive cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> through a firing sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b>, bearings <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> are mounted in a pair of opposed ports <b>344</b> and <b>346</b> provided in the opposed side walls <b>274</b> and <b>276</b> respectively, adjacent the proximal end of forward housing <b>270</b>. Bearing members <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> have a truncated triangular configuration defining a planar bearing surface for guiding cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> as they traverse cartridge assembly <b>58</b> at such times when it is in an articulated position and, in addition, compress the cam bars as they travel into cartridge <b>280</b> as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20–22</figref>, housing structure <b>324</b> of cam bar adapter <b>320</b> is further provided with a pair of spaced apart apertures <b>350</b> and <b>352</b> for retaining a pair of corresponding prongs <b>354</b> and <b>356</b> formed on the shank <b>358</b> of knife <b>240</b>. The rearward section <b>360</b> of housing structure <b>324</b> is of rectangular configuration and defines a structure for engaging groove <b>196</b> in channel member <b>192</b>. Seats <b>362</b> and <b>364</b> are provided on either side of rearward section <b>360</b> for engaging the forked portion <b>194</b> of channel member <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, a flange <b>366</b> extends outwardly from the proximal end of the bottom wall <b>278</b> of forward housing <b>270</b> and includes an aperture <b>368</b> for receiving a rivet <b>370</b>. Rivet <b>370</b> also extends through an aperture <b>372</b> provide in a flange <b>374</b> which extends outwardly from the distal end of rearward housing <b>272</b>. This rivet connection enables forward housing <b>270</b> to articulate relative to rearward housing <b>272</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Rearward housing <b>272</b> is defined by a channel of U-shaped cross-section having opposed side walls <b>376</b> and <b>378</b> and a bottom wall <b>380</b>. Locking slots <b>382</b> and <b>384</b> are formed in the opposed side walls <b>376</b> and <b>378</b> adjacent the proximal end thereof for engaging and retaining support structure <b>214</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). A pair of opposed crimps <b>386</b> and <b>388</b> are provided in opposed side walls <b>376</b> and <b>378</b> adjacent locking slots <b>382</b> and <b>384</b> for establishing a friction fit with cam bar adapter <b>300</b> (or in the alternative cam bar adapter <b>320</b>) within which the dual cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>16</b>, and <b>28</b>, the movement of anvil member <b>56</b> relative to cartridge assembly <b>58</b> in this embodiment is achieved through a linkage and cable system. This system includes a tube collar <b>400</b> which mounts on the distal end of combined upper and lower extension spacers <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>. Tube collar <b>400</b> has an internal partition wall <b>402</b> formed therein through which extends an aperture having a diameter which permits the passage of a cable <b>404</b> therethrough, while prohibiting the passage of an anchor ball <b>406</b> which is fastened to the tailing end of cable <b>404</b>. As it extends from partition wall <b>402</b>, the line of action of cable <b>404</b> is reversed from a proximal direction to a distal direction by turning about a pulley assembly which includes an annular pulley <b>410</b> mounted on a pulley shaft <b>412</b>, and retained thereon by a locking ring <b>414</b>. Pulley shaft <b>412</b> is supported in an aperture <b>416</b> provided adjacent the proximal end of support structure <b>214</b>. Upon turning about pulley <b>410</b>, cable <b>404</b> extends back through tube collar <b>400</b>, avoiding partition wall <b>402</b> and thereafter extending through a mounting collar <b>418</b> positioned on the distal end of outer cover tube <b>182</b> of elongated portion <b>54</b>. Cable <b>404</b> then extends through a longitudinal bore hole <b>420</b> formed in a pivot block <b>422</b>. Pivot block <b>422</b> is rotatably mounted on a flange <b>424</b> extending from mounting collar <b>418</b> by a threaded fastener <b>426</b> maintained in threaded aperture <b>425</b>. Threaded fastener <b>426</b> extends through an aperture <b>428</b> which is provided in flange <b>424</b>. The function and structure of pivot block <b>422</b> will be discussed in greater detail below with respect to the mechanism for articulating cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. After passing through bore hole <b>420</b> in pivot block <b>422</b>, cable <b>404</b> turns about cylindrical pulley <b>248</b> which translates the line of action of cable <b>404</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b>. The cable <b>404</b> is terminated at the trailing end thereof at an upper face of a cable separation block <b>424</b>. A U-shaped anchor cable <b>427</b> extends from the opposed face of cable separator block <b>424</b> and is dimensioned and configured to engage the forward housing <b>270</b> of articulating cartridge assembly <b>58</b> so as to anchor the cable mechanism. Preferably, a cover tube, which may be formed of aluminum or a like material, clothes anchor cable <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The position of cable separator block <b>424</b> with respect to cylindrical pulley <b>248</b> can vary. For example, cable separator block <b>424</b> can be disposed proximal to pulley <b>248</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. In this instance, the cylindrical pulley <b>248</b> would be configured with a pair of spaced apart annular grooves or tracks for accommodating the U-shaped anchor cable <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">During operation of apparatus <b>50</b>, reciprocating movement of the combined extension spacer <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> in response to articulation of handle member <b>62</b> in frame portion <b>52</b>, will cause corresponding translation of tube collar <b>400</b>, thereby causing cable <b>404</b> to move in a longitudinal direction about annular pulley <b>410</b>, and subsequently about cylindrical pulley <b>248</b> in a perpendicular direction. As the trailing end of cable <b>404</b> moves about pulley <b>248</b>, it exerts a force thereupon which consequently causes anvil member <b>56</b> to move relative to the cartridge assembly <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Apparatus <b>50</b> further comprises a mechanism for effectuating the articulation of the forward housing <b>270</b> relative to the rearward housing <b>272</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. The articulation mechanism includes, as stated previously, pivot block <b>422</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25–27</figref>, pivot block <b>422</b> comprises a substantially rectangular body portion <b>430</b> through which extends longitudinal bore hole <b>420</b>, and a transverse bore hole <b>432</b> for receiving pivot pin <b>262</b> about which anvil member <b>56</b> pivots when the cable and linkage system is employed as described hereinabove. A longitudinal groove <b>434</b> is provided in the undersurface of body portion <b>430</b> for permitting passage of knife <b>240</b> as it traverses cartridge assembly <b>58</b> mounted upon cam bar adapter <b>300</b>. A fixed capstan <b>436</b> comprising a shaft portion <b>438</b> and a hood portion <b>440</b> extends upwardly from the body portion <b>430</b> of pivot block <b>422</b> about which an articulation cable <b>442</b> of looped configuration is supported. More particularly, cable <b>442</b> has an anchor ball <b>444</b> intermediate its length which is dimensioned and configured to be fixed within a port <b>446</b> formed in shaft portion <b>438</b> of capstan <b>436</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the walls of longitudinal bore hole <b>420</b> diverge 45° from the central axis thereof at a central point within body portion <b>432</b> so as to define a mouth <b>448</b> at the proximal face <b>450</b> of pivot block <b>422</b>. The diverging mouth <b>448</b> of longitudinal bore hole <b>420</b> enables the relative movement of cable <b>404</b> during articulating movement of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> within a 90° sector of translation wherein Θ<sub>A </sub>and Θ<sub>B </sub>are each equal to 45°. It is also envisioned that, where a wider section of translation is desired, pivot block <b>422</b> and any associated structural elements of the apparatus may be modified to achieve at least 60° of articulation in either direction relative to the longitudinal axis of the instrument. The section of articulation cable <b>442</b> opposite anchor ball <b>444</b> is connected to a dial member <b>452</b> which is provided in the elongated portion <b>54</b> adjacent the proximal end thereof. Rotation of dial member <b>452</b> in either the clockwise or counter clockwise direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>, respectively) will cause articulating cable <b>442</b> to translate in such a manner so as to cause pivot block <b>422</b> to rotate on an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b> about threaded fastener <b>426</b>. Consequently, anvil member <b>56</b>, which is connected to pivot block <b>422</b> through pin member <b>262</b>, and forward housing <b>270</b> which is operatively associated with anvil member <b>56</b> through U-shaped anchor cable <b>427</b>, is caused to pivot about rivet member <b>370</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In use, the elongated portion <b>54</b> of instrument <b>50</b> is inserted into the body, preferably through an endoscopic tube. It is further preferred that the endoscopic tube apparatus be capable of maintaining a sealed pneumoperitoneum, with the internal sealing member of the housing further maintaining this seal despite introduction of the instrument in accordance with the invention into the endoscopic tube. As a practical matter, the jaws of the instrument are closed for insertion into the endoscopic tube, either by pinching the anvil and cartridge prior to insertion or by closing the articulating handle to cam the jaws closed prior to insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, with the instrument properly oriented so that the tissue to be fastened is disposed between the open jaws of the instrument, i.e., between the tissue contacting surfaces of anvil member <b>56</b> and cartridge <b>280</b>, the jaws are closed to clamp the tissue. Closure of the jaws is achieved as the surgeon presses down on articulating handle member <b>62</b>, so as to slide tube collar <b>400</b> distally, via clamp tube <b>70</b>, extension sleeve <b>204</b>, and extension spacers <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The leading end of cable <b>404</b> is drawn in a distal direction as anchor ball <b>406</b> is maintained against partition wall <b>402</b>. As the leading end of cable <b>404</b> is drawn distally, the intermediate section thereof which is turned about annular pulley <b>410</b> is drawn in a proximal direction. Consequently, the trailing end of cable <b>404</b> is urged in an upward direction, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b>, as it turns about cylindrical pulley <b>248</b>, thereby exerting a downward force upon pulley <b>248</b> and urging anvil member <b>56</b> to approximate toward the tissue engaging surface of cartridge assembly <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Where articulation is necessary or desired to orient the jaws prior to clamping, the forward housing <b>270</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> may be articulated relative to the elongated portion <b>54</b> of apparatus <b>50</b> within a 90° sector of rotation, and in particular within a 45° sector of rotation on either side of the longitudinal axis of the elongated portion <b>54</b> of apparatus <b>50</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, clockwise rotation of dial member <b>452</b> will result in clockwise articulation of forward housing <b>270</b> and anvil member <b>58</b>. In particular, as dial member <b>452</b> is rotated, the lateral portions of articulation cable loop <b>426</b> translate in opposite longitudinal directions causing anchor ball <b>444</b> mounted in the shaft portion <b>438</b> of fixed capstan <b>436</b> of pivot block <b>422</b> to urge pivot block <b>422</b> in such a manner so as to rotate in a clockwise direction about threaded fastener <b>426</b>. At such a time, the forward housing <b>270</b> pivots about rivet <b>370</b> relative to the rearward mounting portion <b>272</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. Similarly, rotation of dial member <b>452</b> in a counter-clockwise direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, will articulate cartridge assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">After closing the instrument jaws, the instrument is ready to be fired. When the surgeon is ready to emplace the staples and cut tissue, firing trigger <b>96</b> is depressed to actuate the pneumatic actuator <b>98</b> as discussed in detail above. Piston <b>104</b>, attached to the proximal end of channel <b>192</b> is driven distally causing the camming surface of forked portion <b>194</b> to ride up and over projection <b>362</b> of the cam bar adapter <b>300</b> and drive the cam bar adapter in a distal direction. Thereupon, the cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> and knife <b>240</b> are driven longitudinally through the cartridge to sequentially drive and form staples.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As piston <b>104</b> contacts return springs <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, pusher washers <b>186</b> are compressed on themselves and serve to store energy as the piston moves distally toward the cartridge assembly. This initial compression occurs in the range of between about 20 p.s.i. to about 150 p.s.i. and preferably within a range of about 30 p.s.i. to about 60 p.s.i. Near the end of the distal stroke of the piston <b>104</b>, this stored energy is released to drive the cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> through the final distal limits of their travel within the longitudinal slots in the cartridge <b>250</b>. At the distal extreme of the longitudinal stroke, the overhanging ledges <b>292</b> of cam bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> drop over the edge of the forward cartridge housing <b>270</b> thus abutting vertical surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 35</figref>, after firing, return springs <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> engage piston <b>104</b> and return it to its original position. The return motion of piston <b>104</b> causes rocking lever <b>120</b> to be cammed aside by camming surface <b>144</b> of piston <b>104</b>. Subsequently, the L-shaped support fixture and cam-bars <b>286</b> and <b>288</b> are pulled out of cam bar adapter <b>320</b> and remain in position in the longitudinal slots of the cartridge <b>280</b>. The cam bar adapter <b>320</b>, with knife <b>240</b> attached, moves proximally within rearward cartridge mounting portion <b>272</b> until the outer edges of cam bar adapter <b>320</b> impinge on crimps <b>296</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The cam bar adapter <b>320</b> is held in place by crimps <b>296</b> while camming surfaces <b>198</b> and <b>200</b> of forked portion <b>194</b> causes the fork to ride up and disengage with projections <b>312</b> of the cam bar adapter <b>300</b>. Channel member <b>192</b> continues to move in the proximal direction until it reaches its rest position. At this point, the entire cartridge assembly <b>58</b> is deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the event that the surgeon should accidentally attempt to again fire the instrument without replacing the deactivated cartridge with a new unfired cartridge, the resulting distal longitudinal motion of the channel <b>192</b> moves abutting structure <b>202</b> into contact with rearward projection <b>290</b> effectively preventing further movement of forked portion <b>194</b> toward cam bar adapter <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">After firing, articulating handle <b>62</b> is raised with the assistance of handle return spring <b>82</b> which action retracts collar tube <b>400</b>. This retraction causes anvil <b>56</b> to move of engagement with cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. Similarly, raising of articulating handle <b>62</b> causes cam slide <b>124</b> to move upward disengaging the pneumatic firing mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In order to replace the articulating cartridge assembly <b>58</b>, the instrument is withdrawn from the patient. Thereafter, the cartridge assembly is removed from the elongated portion <b>54</b> of apparatus <b>50</b>. To reinsert a new cartridge assembly, the proximal mounting portion <b>272</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> is inserted into the distal end of elongated portion <b>54</b>. The instrument is now ready for reinsertion and continued use.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 38</figref>, another preferred embodiment of the surgical apparatus of the subject invention is illustrated and is designated generally by reference numeral <b>500</b>. Surgical apparatus <b>500</b> functions in much the same manner as the surgical instrument <b>50</b> previously described, with the exception of the mechanism for effectuating the articulation of the cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. Specifically, the articulation mechanism of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> comprises two assemblies, including a parallel crank linkage assembly <b>505</b> disposed adjacent the cartridge assembly <b>58</b> at the distal end of elongated portion <b>54</b>, and an actuation assembly, shown generally at <b>510</b>, located adjacent the frame portion <b>52</b> of the apparatus at the proximal end of elongated portion <b>54</b>. In the discussion which follows, both the linkage assembly <b>505</b> and the axial barrel cam assembly <b>510</b> will be described with respect to various embodiments. It will be appreciated however, by those having ordinary skill in the art, that any of the assemblies described herein may be modified to incorporate features shown in the various preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40–42</figref>, the parallel crank linkage assembly <b>505</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> is associated with a mounting collar <b>512</b> having an engaging portion <b>514</b> adapted for mounting within the distal end of cover tube <b>182</b>. The linkage assembly <b>505</b> includes a proximal crank member <b>516</b> mounted for rotation about a pivot pin <b>518</b> which extends through the rearward flange portion <b>520</b> of mounting collar <b>512</b>. Pivot pin <b>518</b> is disposed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b>. Longitudinally spaced from proximal crank member <b>516</b>, a distal crank member <b>522</b> is mounted for rotation about a pivot pin <b>524</b>. Pivot pin <b>524</b> extends through the forward flange portion <b>526</b> of mounting collar <b>512</b> and is disposed parallel to pivot pin <b>518</b>. Distal crank <b>522</b> is associated with a pivot block <b>528</b> having a longitudinal bore <b>530</b> extending therethrough for accommodating cable <b>404</b>. As previously described herein, cable <b>404</b> is associated with moving anvil member <b>56</b> between an open position and a closed position for clamping tissue. Pivot block <b>528</b> is also provided with a transverse bore <b>532</b> for accommodating the transverse pin <b>262</b> about which anvil member <b>56</b> pivots as it is moved between its open and closed positions.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Linkage assembly <b>505</b> further comprises a pair of parallel coupler links <b>534</b> and <b>536</b> which operatively interconnect the proximal crank member <b>516</b> and distal crank member <b>522</b>. Link <b>534</b> has a longitudinal span <b>538</b> with a transverse engaging slot <b>540</b> formed at a distal end thereof for engaging a pin <b>542</b> associated with distal crank <b>522</b>, and a transverse engaging slot <b>544</b> is provided at the proximal end thereof for engaging another pin <b>546</b> associated with the proximal crank <b>516</b>. Similarly, link <b>536</b> has a longitudinal span <b>548</b> with a transverse engaging slot <b>550</b> provided at the distal end thereof for engaging a pin <b>552</b> associated with the distal crank member <b>522</b>, and a transverse slot <b>554</b> is formed at the proximal end thereof for engaging yet another pin <b>556</b> disposed on the proximal crank member <b>516</b>. Of the two coupler links <b>534</b> and <b>536</b>, link <b>534</b> defines a driver link, while link <b>536</b> defines a follower link. Moreover, driver link <b>536</b> is provided with a coupling <b>558</b>, which depends from the undersurface thereof, intermediate span <b>538</b> for receiving and mounting the distal end of an elongated transmission rod <b>560</b>. Transmission rod <b>560</b> extends through the elongated portion <b>54</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> for transmitting reciprocal longitudinal motion to driver link <b>534</b> in response to manipulation of the axial barrel cam assembly <b>510</b>. Transverse slots <b>540</b>, <b>544</b>, <b>550</b>, and <b>554</b> permit coupler links <b>534</b> and <b>536</b> to remain parallel to a longitudinal axis of the linkage assembly <b>505</b> during transmission of the reciprocal longitudinal motion by rod <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36–39</figref>, the actuation assembly <b>510</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> comprises a generally cylindrical manipulator sleeve <b>562</b> disposed about the proximal section of elongated portion <b>54</b>. Manipulator sleeve <b>562</b> is configured and dimensioned for axial movement with respect to the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b>. In particular, manipulator sleeve <b>562</b> may be rotated about the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b> to rotate the cartridge assembly <b>58</b> relative to the frame portion <b>52</b> of apparatus <b>500</b>, and reciprocally in a generally longitudinal direction for effectuating the articulation of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> so as to increase the range of operability of the instrument, which will be described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A barrel cam <b>564</b> having a substantially hemi-cylindrical configuration is associated with manipulator sleeve <b>562</b> and is configured and dimensioned for rotational movement as sleeve <b>562</b> is manipulated in a longitudinal direction to drive transmission rod <b>560</b>. Relative rotational movement of barrel cam <b>564</b> is facilitated by the interaction of a cam follower pin <b>566</b> extending radially inward from manipulator sleeve <b>562</b>, and a cam slot <b>568</b> defined in barrel cam <b>564</b>. Cam slot <b>568</b> has a three stage configuration including an upper step region <b>570</b>, a central step region <b>572</b>, and a lower step region <b>574</b>. When articulating the cartridge assembly <b>58</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> in a counter-clockwise direction, sleeve <b>562</b> is manipulated in a proximal direction, moving cam follower pin <b>566</b> from the central step region <b>572</b>, wherein cartridge assembly <b>58</b> is in substantial longitudinal alignment with the elongated portion <b>54</b> of the instrument, to the upper step region <b>570</b> of cam slot <b>568</b>, to axially rotate barrel cam <b>564</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">To articulate cartridge assembly <b>58</b> in clockwise direction, sleeve <b>562</b> is manipulated in a distal direction, moving cam follower pin <b>566</b> to the lower step region <b>574</b> of cam slot <b>568</b>, and thereby axially rotating barrel cam <b>564</b>. The longitudinal dimension of cam slot <b>568</b> can be modified depending upon the tactile sensation desired to be transmitted to the user of the instrument. In addition, an annular rib <b>563</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>) extending radially outward from the cover tube <b>182</b> of elongated portion <b>54</b>, distal to manipulator sleeve <b>562</b>, serves to prevent over-insertion of the elongated portion <b>54</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> into a trocar or cannula device.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As stated briefly above, the rotational movement of barrel cam <b>564</b> is conveyed to transmission rod <b>560</b> for effectuating the articulation of cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. This conveyance of rotational motion is accomplished by engaging an arm <b>580</b> formed at the proximal end of transmission rod <b>560</b> within an angled drive slot <b>582</b> defined in barrel cam <b>564</b>. Thus, as barrel cam <b>564</b> rotates in response to the translation of cam follower pin <b>566</b> within cam slot <b>568</b>, transmission rod <b>560</b> is advantageously driven in a longitudinal direction as the peripheral walls of angled drive slot <b>582</b> are urged against the engaging arm <b>580</b> thereof. To secure the engagement of arm <b>580</b> within angled drive slot <b>582</b>, a connective fitting <b>584</b> is mounted atop engagement arm <b>576</b> and is configured and dimensioned to move within longitudinal channel <b>585</b> formed in an inner surface of manipulation sleeve <b>562</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Barrel cam <b>564</b> is also provided with a pair of spaced apart transverse alignment slots <b>586</b> and <b>588</b> which are adapted and configured for cooperatively receiving a pair of guide pins <b>590</b> and <b>592</b>. Guide pins <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> are associated with the outer tube <b>182</b> of elongated portion <b>54</b> and inhibit undesirable longitudinal shifting of the barrel cam <b>564</b> which may arise as sleeve <b>562</b> is manipulated. In addition, guide pins <b>590</b> and <b>592</b> achieve connection between the outer tube <b>182</b> of elongated portion <b>54</b> and the manipulator sleeve <b>662</b> via the interaction of cam follower pin <b>566</b> and cam slot <b>568</b>. This connection is further assisted by the provision of a spring loaded locking mechanism associated with manipulator sleeve <b>562</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 39</figref>, the locking mechanism includes a lock ball <b>594</b> which is biased by a coiled spring <b>596</b> maintained within a cavity <b>598</b> formed within manipulator sleeve <b>562</b>. Lock ball <b>594</b> is selectively engageable within a plurality of spaced apart notches disposed about the outer circumference of cover tube <b>182</b> and including a primary notch <b>600</b> corresponding to the cam follower pin <b>566</b> being disposed in the upper step region <b>570</b> of cam slot <b>568</b>, a secondary notch <b>602</b> corresponding to cam follower pin <b>566</b> being disposed in the central step region <b>572</b> of cam slot <b>568</b>, and a tertiary notch <b>603</b> corresponding to cam follower pin <b>566</b> being disposed in the lower step region <b>574</b> of cam slot <b>568</b>. By lockingly engaging the cover tube <b>182</b> of elongated portion <b>54</b>, rotation of manipulator sleeve <b>562</b> about the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b> will effectuate remote rotation of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> relative to the frame portion <b>52</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In use, as sleeve <b>562</b> is manipulated in a distal direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>), transmission rod <b>560</b> will translate in a proximal direction with respect to elongated portion <b>54</b>, pulling driver link <b>534</b> proximally as indicated by arrow “A” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. In response, distal crank member <b>522</b> is rotated about pivot pin <b>524</b>, thereby turning pivot block <b>528</b> in a clockwise direction. As pivot block <b>528</b> is operatively connected to anvil member <b>56</b> through transverse pin <b>262</b>, the forward housing <b>270</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> is caused to articulate in a clockwise direction. Similarly, in response to manipulation of sleeve <b>562</b> in a proximal direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>), transmission rod <b>560</b> will translate distally with respect to elongated portion <b>54</b>, pushing driver link <b>534</b> distally as indicated by arrow “B” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. As a result, distal crank member <b>522</b> will turn pivot block <b>528</b> in a counter-clockwise direction, articulating the forward housing <b>270</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> in a counter-clockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Another preferred embodiment of the parallel linkage assembly <b>505</b> of the mechanism for effectuating the articulation of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45–49</figref>. This assembly includes a looped cable <b>620</b>, which replaces the parallel coupler links <b>534</b> and <b>536</b> discussed hereinabove, for operatively associating the spaced apart proximal and distal crank members <b>516</b> and <b>522</b>, which, in this embodiment, serve primarily as a pair of capstans. A first ball-type fastener <b>622</b> is provided at the leading portion of cable loop <b>620</b> for securing the cable to distal crank member <b>522</b>, and a second ball-type fastener <b>624</b> is provided at the trailing portion of cable loop <b>620</b> for fixing the cable to proximal crank member <b>516</b>. A coupling <b>626</b> is rigidly mounted on the driving leg <b>628</b> of cable loop <b>620</b> for operatively receiving and retaining the distal end of transmission rod <b>560</b> so as to interconnect the actuation assembly <b>510</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> to the linkage assembly <b>505</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, in use, the cable loop <b>620</b> is manipulated through longitudinal translation of transmission rod <b>560</b> in response to manipulation of barrel cam assembly <b>510</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 38</figref>). Thus, proximal translation of transmission rod <b>560</b>, as indicated by arrow “C” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, will cause cable loop <b>620</b> to rotate in a clockwise direction, turning pivot block <b>528</b> in a clockwise direction to articulate the forward housing <b>270</b> of cartridge housing <b>58</b> through an arcuate path (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>). Similarly, distal translation of transmission rod <b>560</b>, as indicated by arrow “D” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, will cause cable loop <b>620</b> to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, causing distal crank member <b>522</b> to pivot in a counter-clockwise direction. As a result, the forward housing <b>270</b> of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> will be moved arcuately in a counter-clockwise direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Another preferred embodiment of the actuation assembly <b>510</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51</figref>, and is particularly adapted and configured for progressively articulating cartridge assembly <b>58</b> within an angular sector of rotation. This assembly comprises a sleeve member <b>650</b> disposed about the elongated portion <b>54</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b> adjacent the frame portion <b>52</b> thereof. A continuous helical track <b>652</b> is defined about the outer circumference of the distal end portion <b>654</b> of sleeve member <b>650</b>, and a knurl <b>656</b> is formed at the proximal end portion of sleeve member <b>650</b>. An annular knob member <b>658</b> is mounted coaxial with the distal end portion of sleeve member <b>650</b> and is provided with a pair of opposed and staggered follower pins <b>660</b> and <b>662</b> which are configured and positioned to travel within helical track <b>652</b> as knob member <b>658</b> is rotated relative to sleeve member <b>650</b> for effecting the progressive articulation of cartridge assembly <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">A retainer ring <b>664</b> having an annular flange portion <b>668</b> is mounted within an annular groove <b>670</b> defined in knob member <b>658</b>. Retainer ring <b>664</b> is also provided with an engagement port <b>672</b> for receiving the engaging arm <b>580</b> formed at the proximal end of transmission rod <b>560</b>. A pair of diametrically opposed grooves <b>674</b> and <b>676</b> are formed in the interior of retainer ring <b>664</b> for engaging a pair of opposed corresponding keys <b>678</b> and <b>680</b> which extend radially outward from the cover tube <b>182</b> of elongated portion <b>54</b> adjacent sleeve member <b>650</b>. Through this engagement, rotation of transmission rod <b>560</b> will be inhibited as knob member <b>658</b> is rotated to drive transmission rod <b>560</b> in a longitudinal direction for effectuating the progressive articulation of cartridge assembly <b>58</b>. However, when sleeve member <b>650</b> is rotated about the longitudinal axis of elongated portion <b>54</b>, the engagement of the keys <b>678</b> and <b>680</b> within the opposed grooves <b>674</b> and <b>676</b> will effectuate rotation of cartridge assembly <b>58</b> relative to the frame portion <b>52</b> of surgical apparatus <b>500</b>. Finally, a securement ring <b>682</b> is fastened to the distal face <b>684</b> of knob member <b>658</b> by a plurality of threaded fasteners <b>686</b> for maintaining retainer ring <b>664</b> within annular groove <b>670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, another preferred embodiment of a surgical instrument in accordance with the subject invention is illustrated and is designated generally by reference numeral <b>700</b>. This instrument is intended to provide the surgeon with a substantially increased range of operability during a surgical procedure. In brief, surgical instrument <b>700</b> comprises a frame or handle assembly <b>702</b>, an elongated body portion <b>704</b> extending from the handle assembly <b>702</b> and defining a longitudinal axis, and a fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> which is pivotably associated with a distal end <b>708</b> of body portion <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> includes a base portion <b>710</b> which is pivotably mounted to the distal end <b>708</b> of body portion <b>706</b> by means of a main joint pin <b>707</b> (see generally <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>). A cartridge assembly <b>712</b> is configured to be mounted within the base portion <b>710</b> and an anvil member <b>715</b> is positioned adjacent the cartridge assembly <b>712</b> against which staples ejected from the cartridge assembly are formed (see generally <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Surgical instrument <b>700</b> includes three mechanisms for effectuating distinct movements of the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b>. These mechanisms include a rotation control mechanism for effectuating rotation of the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> about a longitudinal axis defined by the elongated body portion <b>704</b>. This first mechanism is operated through rotation of a control knob <b>714</b> which is fixed about the proximal end of body portion <b>704</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>). The second mechanism is an articulation control mechanism for moving the base portion <b>710</b> of the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> relative to the elongated body portion <b>704</b> within an angular sector of rotation. This second mechanism is operated through rotation of control knob <b>716</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>). A third mechanism is provided for controlling the independent rotation of the cartridge assembly <b>712</b> together with the anvil member <b>715</b> relative to the base portion <b>710</b> of the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>). This third mechanism is operated through rotation of control knob <b>718</b>. These control mechanisms will be described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55–57</figref>, the handle assembly <b>702</b> of surgical instrument <b>700</b> includes a handle body <b>720</b> for enclosing a pneumatic actuation which is operative to effectuate the ejection of surgical staples from the cartridge assembly <b>712</b>. This pneumatic assembly is similar in many respects to those described hereinabove. However, the pneumatic assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55–57</figref> serves to create a power stroke which is directed in a proximal direction rather than a distal direction. In brief, the pneumatic assembly includes a gas supply container <b>722</b>, a piston member <b>724</b> having a piston head <b>727</b> accommodated within a cylinder <b>725</b> and a coiled return spring <b>726</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, piston head <b>727</b> has a substantially elliptical configuration, as does the cylinder <b>725</b> within which it is accommodated. The elliptical configuration of piston head <b>727</b> and cylinder <b>725</b> provides increased power during a staple driving operation while maintaining substantially the same overall dimensions of the handle assembly <b>702</b>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention wherein surgical instrument <b>700</b> is adapted to apply six rows of staples, each staple row measuring about 60 mm in length, and to simultaneously cut between the two innermost staple rows, the major axis of elliptical piston head <b>727</b> is between about 0.65 and 0.70 inches, and the minor axis is between about 0.45 and 0.50 inches. The corresponding elliptical cylinder <b>725</b> has a major axis of about 0.80 to 0.85 inches and a minor axis of about 0.60 to 0.65 inches. An elliptical O-ring is provided on piston head <b>727</b> to pneumatically seal piston head <b>727</b> to cylinder <b>725</b>. Other cross-sectional configurations are also contemplated and are within the scope of the invention. A flexible conduit <b>723</b> connects the gas supply container <b>722</b> to piston <b>724</b> for the delivery of compressed gas. In use, the delivery of compressed gas from the container <b>722</b> is controlled by a trigger <b>731</b> disposed at the proximal end of handle body <b>720</b>. Operation of trigger <b>731</b> to fire the instrument is substantially identical to that described above with respect to the other embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">An elongated actuation rod <b>728</b> is associated with piston <b>724</b> and extends operatively therefrom, through the body portion <b>704</b> of surgical instrument <b>700</b>, to the distal end <b>708</b> thereof. The distal end of actuation rod <b>728</b> is mounted to a cartridge adapter <b>730</b> which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> in conjunction with the removable cartridge assembly <b>712</b>. Adapter <b>730</b> interconnects actuation rod <b>728</b> to a stepped draw bar <b>732</b>. Draw bar <b>732</b> defines a proximal section <b>734</b>, an intermediate stepped section <b>736</b>, and a distal section <b>738</b>. The distal section <b>738</b> of draw bar <b>732</b> extends through the cartridge assembly <b>712</b>, beneath the staple carrying cartridge <b>737</b> disposed therein, to connect with a staple ejecting assembly associated with the cartridge assembly <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58 and 59</figref>, the staple ejecting assembly includes a cam driver <b>740</b> which serves to drive a plurality of spaced apart cam members, i.e. cam members <b>742</b>. The cam members are disposed within, and translate along, a plurality of tracks defined in the staple containing cartridge <b>737</b> (see generally <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Cam members <b>742</b> are dimensioned and configured to effect the sequential ejection of a plurality of surgical staples from the staple containing cartridge <b>737</b> as a result of their travel from an initial distal position to a final proximal position. The staple ejecting assembly further comprises a knife blade <b>744</b> mounted upon a shank <b>746</b> which is adapted to translate with and behind cam members <b>742</b> during a stapling operation to divide the stapled tissue. The ejection of staples from the cartridge is accomplished much in the same way as that which has been described hereinabove with respect to previous embodiments of the subject invention. However, as described herein, cam members <b>742</b> translate from a distal to a proximal direction to sequentially drive the staples from the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In operation, the sequential ejection of a plurality of surgical staples from the staple containing cartridge <b>737</b> is effectuated by depressing trigger <b>731</b>. Movement of trigger <b>731</b> will cause gas to be released from supply container <b>722</b> which will exert pressure upon the elliptical piston head <b>727</b>, urging piston <b>724</b> in a proximal direction. As piston <b>724</b> translates proximally, return spring <b>726</b> is compressed, and actuation rod <b>728</b> is drawn proximally therewith. As a result, draw bar <b>732</b> is pulled proximally within the elongated portion <b>704</b> of surgical instrument <b>700</b>. The proximal translation of draw bar <b>732</b> causes the cam members <b>742</b> to travel in proximal direction within the tracks which are defined in the staple containing cartridge <b>737</b>. Once the cam bars have completed their proximal-to-distal translation through the staple-containing cartridge <b>737</b>, the pressurized cylinder <b>725</b> vents through a plurality of circumferentially disposed apertures <b>747</b>, thereby permitting compressed return spring <b>726</b> to drive piston <b>724</b> distally into its initial pre-fired position. The distal movement of actuation rod <b>728</b> in response to decompression of return spring <b>726</b> causes cartridge adaptor <b>730</b> to return cam members <b>732</b> distally through staple-containing cartridge <b>737</b>. However, knife blade <b>744</b> preferably remains in its proximal-most position by disengaging from the staple firing mechanism, e.g., by becoming lodged in a plastic knife block at the proximal end of the knife blade's travel path through staple-containing cartridge <b>737</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 55 and 56</figref>, handle assembly <b>702</b> further comprises an actuation lever <b>750</b> for controlling the approximation of the cartridge assembly <b>712</b> and the anvil member <b>715</b>. Actuation lever <b>750</b> is operatively connected to an approximation cable <b>754</b> which extends through the body portion <b>704</b> of surgical instrument <b>700</b> to an approximation link <b>755</b> associated with the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b>. The distal end <b>756</b> of cable <b>754</b> is terminated in a universal ball joint fitting <b>758</b> which is maintained within a cavity <b>760</b> defined within approximation link <b>755</b>. The entryway to cavity <b>760</b> is tapered to accommodate the angular bending of cable <b>754</b> during approximation.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Approximation link <b>755</b> is normally biased into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref> so as to maintain the cartridge assembly <b>712</b> and anvil member <b>715</b> in an open position. This may be accomplished by known biasing structure including, for example, a leaf, compression or torsion spring. Approximation link <b>755</b> is pivotably associated with cartridge assembly <b>712</b> through a transverse pivot pin <b>762</b>, and it is associated with the anvil member <b>715</b> through a cam pin <b>764</b>. Cam pin <b>764</b> is dimensioned and configured to cooperate with a cam slot <b>766</b> which is defined within articulator link <b>755</b>. To approximate the cartridge housing <b>712</b> toward the anvil member <b>715</b> to engage tissue therebetween, lever <b>750</b> is moved from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, causing approximation cable <b>752</b> to be drawn proximally. As approximation cable <b>752</b> is drawn proximally, link <b>755</b> will rotate about pivot pin <b>762</b> in a clockwise direction, urging cam pin <b>764</b> to move through an arcuate path under the influence of cam slot <b>766</b>, thereby approximating cartridge assembly <b>712</b> and anvil member <b>715</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61 and 63</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>, the mechanism for effectuating the articulated movement of the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> relative to the elongated portion <b>704</b> of surgical instrument <b>700</b> includes a planetary gear assembly <b>770</b>. Planetary gear assembly <b>770</b> is operatively connected to the base portion <b>710</b> of fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> by means of an offset elongated transmission link <b>772</b> which extends through body portion <b>704</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, the planetary gear assembly <b>770</b> is associated with knob <b>716</b> and includes an outer ring gear <b>774</b>, an internal gear <b>776</b> which rotates about a fixed axis in response to the rotation of outer ring gear <b>774</b>, and a worm gear <b>778</b>. Worm gear <b>778</b> extends through the center of the internal gear <b>776</b> and translates longitudinally in response to rotation of internal gear <b>776</b>. Worm gear <b>778</b> is operatively connected to the proximal end of the elongated transmission link <b>772</b>. The distal end of transmission link <b>772</b> is pivotably connected to the base portion <b>710</b> of fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> by means of pivot pin <b>780</b>. Thus, in operation, rotation of knob <b>716</b> in the direction indicated by arrow “A” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> will cause corresponding longitudinal translation of offset link <b>722</b>, articulating the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> within an angular sector of rotation, i.e. within a 45° sector of rotation with respect to the longitudinal axis defined by the elongated body <b>704</b> as indicated by arrow “A′” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> to increase the range of operability of the apparatus of the subject invention. Although the surgical instrument <b>700</b> is shown with a base portion articulatable in only a singular radial direction, it is well within the scope of the present invention to provide for a base portion capable of articulation in symmetric radial directions as shown in the preceding embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60</figref>, <b>63</b>, and <b>64</b>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, the mechanism for effectuating the independent rotation of the cartridge assembly <b>712</b> together with the anvil member <b>715</b> relative to the base portion <b>710</b> of the fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> includes proximal and distal planetary gear assemblies <b>782</b> and <b>784</b>. The proximal planetary gear assembly <b>782</b> is interconnected to the distal planetary gear assembly <b>784</b> by means of an offset elongated transmission axle <b>786</b>. Proximal planetary gear assembly <b>782</b> is associated with the distalmost control knob <b>718</b> on elongated body portion <b>704</b> and is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>. Gear assembly <b>782</b> includes an outer ring gear <b>788</b> which rotates in response to rotation of knob <b>718</b>, and an internal gear <b>790</b> which is configured to rotate about a fixed axis in response to the rotation of outer ring gear <b>788</b>. The proximal end of transmission axle <b>786</b>, which preferably has a hexagonal cross-section, is axially mounted within the internal gear <b>790</b> and is configured to rotate therewith in response to rotation of knob <b>718</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The distal planetary gear assembly <b>784</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, is associated with the base portion <b>710</b> of fastener applying assembly <b>706</b> and includes an outer pinion gear <b>792</b>. Pinion gear <b>792</b> is configured to rotate in response to the rotation of transmission axle <b>786</b>. More particularly, the outer pinion gear <b>792</b> is mounted to transmission axial <b>786</b> by means of a flexible coupling rod <b>794</b> which may be fabricated from a pseudoelastic material such as, for example, TINEL material. Other types of rotational drive structure are also contemplated and are within the scope of the invention. These include, for example, universal joints, reinforced flex cabling, etc. The proximal end of coupling rod <b>794</b> is mounted in the distal end of the transmission axle <b>786</b>, and the distal end thereof is mounted to a fitting <b>796</b> which is operatively associated with outer pinion gear <b>792</b>. The distal planetary gear assembly <b>784</b> further includes an internal ring gear <b>798</b> which is configured to rotate in response to the rotation of pinion gear <b>792</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>, the proximal end of the cartridge assembly <b>712</b> defines an adapter fitting <b>800</b>, which is dimensioned and configured to mount operatively within the internal ring gear <b>798</b> of the distal planetary gear assembly <b>784</b> so as to effectuate the independent rotation thereof relative to the base portion <b>710</b> of fastener applying assembly <b>706</b>. Thus, in operation, rotation of the distal knob <b>718</b> in the direction indicated by arrow “B” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> will cause corresponding rotation of transmission axial <b>786</b>, which, in turn, will rotate the flexible coupling rod <b>794</b>. In response, the outer pinion gear <b>792</b> will rotate, causing the internal ring gear <b>798</b> to rotate along with cartridge assembly <b>712</b> in the direction indicated by arrow “B′” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>. Furthermore, since the anvil <b>715</b> is mounted adjacent the cartridge housing <b>712</b> it will rotate therewith so as to further increase the range of operability of the surgical apparatus of the subject invention.</p>
