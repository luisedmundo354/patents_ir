<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0042105 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on May 19, 2005, and Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0064924 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 18, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a presser foot and a sewing machine using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a presser foot and a sewing machine using the same for home or industrial use having an advantage of producing an enhanced quality of the final sewed product by preventing damage and/or a defect thereof by rapidly cooling a needle moving at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(b) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, a sewing machine is an apparatus for sewing materials such as leathers, clothes, papers, etc. Such a sewing machine includes a head installed with a sewing mechanism, a table for sewing a work material (e.g., clothes) thereon, and a driving apparatus (e.g., a motor) that produces power for the sewing machine. The head is installed with, for example, a needle bar holding a needle and moving up and down with the needle, a shuttle race cross-engaging upper and lower threads for each back and forth movement of the needle, a thread take-up device pulling the upper thread up to above the work material in accordance with the lower thread when the cross-engagement with the lower thread is finished, and a feed dog mechanism feeding the work material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The needle of the sewing machine vertically moves at a very high speed for sewing a work material, and the needle is subjected to a high heat produced by friction with the work material. In more detail, according to a conventional sewing machine, the work material may be locally melted by the needle heated to a high temperature by the friction, especially when the work material being sewn is formed of a thermally weak material. In this case, the melted bit of the work material may stick to the needle and come out of the work material with the movement of the needle, such that the surface of the work material may become dotted with leavings of the melted bits solidified thereon, thereby producing defects of the sewed product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a more specific example, when a cap is manufactured with a visor core made of a synthetic resin material, the visor core, which is thermally weak, is locally melted by the needle heated to a high temperature, and melted bits thereof come out of the cap such that the surface of the cap may be stained with the leavings of the melted bits of the synthetic resin. Such leavings may not be easily blown off by highly pressurized air, and thus defective products may finally be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in an effort to provide a presser foot and a sewing machine using the same having advantages of enhancing quality of sewn products by preventing leavings of a work material from staining the sewn products by cooling a needle moving at a high speed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a sewing machine according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The sewing machine includes a sewing machine head <b>1</b> installed with a sewing mechanism, a table <b>3</b> on which a work material (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is laid and moved while sewing, and a driving apparatus (e.g., a motor) that produces power for the sewing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A needle <b>7</b> reciprocally moving in a vertical direction is assembled to the sewing machine head <b>1</b> through a needle bar <b>8</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that enables maintenance and exchange of the needle <b>7</b>. In addition, the head <b>1</b> is provided with a presser foot <b>100</b> pressing the work material.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a thread receiving groove <b>14</b> for temporarily receiving the upper thread <b>11</b> is formed at the needle <b>7</b> in a length direction thereof. When the needle <b>7</b> penetrates the work material W together with the thread <b>11</b>, the thread <b>11</b> is temporarily aligned with and stored in the thread receiving groove <b>14</b>. Therefore, the thread <b>11</b> therein is protected from breakage, thereby preventing an interruption of the sewing process. Dotted arrows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> denote a direction in which the thread <b>11</b> is pressed toward the thread receiving groove <b>14</b> by the work material W when the thread <b>11</b> penetrates the work material W. As will be described later, the direction of the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the same as a direction in which a fluid flows toward the needle <b>7</b> for cooling it.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The presser foot <b>100</b> includes a body <b>131</b> and a fixing member <b>151</b>. The body <b>131</b> presses the work material when sewing. The fixing member <b>151</b> is hinge-engaged with the body <b>131</b> through a hinge pin <b>90</b> and is fixed with the head <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A configuration of the presser foot <b>100</b> will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A needle hole <b>170</b> is formed at the presser foot <b>100</b> such that the needle <b>7</b> may pass therethrough in order to sew the work material W. The needle hole <b>170</b> is formed as a hole penetrating the body <b>131</b> in a vertical direction (i.e., z-axis direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). However, the shape of the needle hole <b>170</b> is not necessarily limited thereto, and to the contrary, the needle hole <b>170</b> may be formed in any shape to form a passage for the needle <b>7</b> to sew the work material W.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A fluid line is formed at the body <b>131</b> such that a fluid, such as a cold air received from a compressor (not shown) or a fan, may be injected to the needle hole <b>170</b> through the fluid line. Hereinafter, the fluid line is also called an air line since air is used as an example of the fluid in the exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The fluid line includes a fluid supply passage <b>210</b> (hereinafter, also called an “air supply passage”) and a fluid exhaust passage <b>230</b> (hereinafter, also called an “air exhaust passage”). The fluid supply passage <b>210</b> is formed penetrating through the body <b>131</b> in the length direction (i.e., a y-axis direction shown in the drawings) thereof and intersecting the needle hole <b>170</b>. The fluid exhaust passage <b>230</b> also intersects the needle hole <b>170</b> and it exhausts the fluid received at the needle hole <b>170</b> from the fluid supply passage <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with the structural feature of the presser foot <b>100</b> having a bent portion, the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may be curvedly formed through the bent portion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One end of the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> is closed, e.g., by plugging it with a screw <b>250</b>, and the other end thereof is connected with a fluid supply device <b>310</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) through a line member <b>270</b> (for example, a hose of transparent synthetic resin material). In more detail, a connection member <b>291</b> is interconnected between the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> and the line member <b>270</b> such that their connection may become easier and firmer. One end of the connection member <b>291</b>, which is to be engaged with the fluid supply passage <b>210</b>, is formed of threads such that the connection member <b>291</b> may be screw engaged with the fluid supply passage <b>210</b>. The line member <b>270</b> may be connected with the connection member <b>291</b> by a tight fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fluid supply device <b>310</b> may be realized as a compressor compressing an air or as a fan supplying a cooled air. Although air is used as a coolant in an embodiment of the present invention, other gases may also be used for cooling the needle <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> is formed in the y-axis direction at a biased position in a width direction (i.e., an x-axis direction in the drawings) of the body <b>131</b> of the presser foot <b>100</b>. The fluid exhaust passage <b>230</b> connected with the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> is formed in the x-axis direction and penetrates the needle hole <b>170</b> formed at the body <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The fluid (e.g., a compressed air) received through the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> is injected to the needle hole <b>170</b> through the fluid exhaust passage <b>230</b>. Therefore, although the needle <b>7</b> is heated by friction with the work material W while moving at a high speed, it may be cooled by the injected fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, the fluid supply device <b>310</b> may be connected with the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> through a valve V that is controlled by a switch SW (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The switch SW may be realized as a limit switch operated according to an operation of the driving apparatus (not shown), or alternatively, it may be switched on and off by a switching device. The valve V may be controlled on and off by an operation of the switch SW, and a speed controller may be further provided so as to control a flow rate of the fluid (e.g., a compressed air).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the fluid line formed at the body <b>131</b> of the presser foot <b>100</b> is dividedly formed by the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> and the fluid exhaust passage <b>230</b>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and an exemplary variation of the first embodiment will hereinafter be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a fluid line <b>220</b> is formed in the x-axis direction through a body <b>132</b> of the presser foot <b>200</b> crossing between opposite lateral sides of the body <b>132</b> such that the fluid may be injected directly to the needle hole <b>170</b>. The fluid line <b>220</b> is connected with the line member <b>270</b> through a connection member <b>291</b>, and the fluid, such as compressed air, is supplied to the needle hole <b>170</b> through the fluid line <b>220</b>. Such a second exemplary embodiment is an example of variations of the first embodiment, and enables cooling of the needle by a simpler configuration of the presser foot. In the above description of the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, elements and features that are the same as in the first embodiment may be referred to as in the description described in connection with the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the above described schemes, a needle moving at a high speed during the operation of a sewing machine may be cooled by a fluid (e.g., compressed air) injected to the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Hereinafter, an operation of the sewing machine and a sewing method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An operator lays a work material (for example, a cap manufactured by sewing a visor core made of a synthetic resin material that is thermally weak) on the table <b>3</b>, and starts the driving apparatus. In more detail, a sheet of a synthetic resin material forming the visor core of the cap is firstly laid on the table. Then, a fabric is disposed to simply cover the synthetic resin material sheet or to wrap it, and the driving apparatus is started. Here, the fabric may be a cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Then, the needle <b>7</b> inserted with the upper thread starts its vertical movement for the sewing. At the same time, the switch SW is turned on to open the on/off valve V, and thus, the fluid (e.g., compressed air) of the fluid supply device <b>310</b> is flowed into the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> via the line member <b>270</b>. The fluid flowed into the fluid supply passage <b>210</b> is exhausted through the fluid exhaust passage <b>230</b>, passing through the needle hole <b>170</b> of the body <b>131</b>. In this case, the needle <b>7</b> reciprocates in the needle hole <b>170</b>, and thus it is rapidly cooled by the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The thread receiving groove <b>14</b> of the needle <b>7</b> may be formed at a position facing an upstream side of the fluid exhaust passage <b>210</b> such that the fluid is injected toward the thread receiving groove <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the thread <b>11</b> (i.e., the upper thread) is not waved by the fluid but securely remains in the thread receiving groove <b>14</b>. Therefore, the sewing may be maintained stable and fine since the thread <b>11</b> minimally interferes with the working material W and thus it is protected from friction therebetween. Therefore, defects of the sewn products are further prevented and a higher quality of the products may be obtained due to such a feature in addition to preventing local melting of the work material by the hot needle and protecting the sewn product from the leavings of the melted bits of the work material.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a more specific example, when a visor core (which is typically made of a thermally weak material) is sewed to manufacture a cap, the needle <b>7</b> is rapidly cooled so as to prevent heating of the needle <b>7</b> above a predetermined level, and thus the melting of the visor core due to a hot needle may be prevented. Therefore, high quality products may be continuously manufactured, and thus improvement of quality and productivity may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above specific example, the present invention is exemplified in the sewing of the visor core that is usually made of a thermally weak material, however, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto. It may also be exemplified in stitches used for sewing a protection member of a thermally weak material in the front of a crown portion of a cap.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of a presser foot <b>300</b> according to a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The presser foot <b>300</b> according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention is similar to the above-described presser feet <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>, and thus only the differences therefrom will be focused on in the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the first and second exemplary embodiments, the fixing member <b>151</b> is hinge-engaged with the body <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> of the presser feet <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>. However, according to the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a body <b>133</b> of the presser foot <b>300</b> is integrally formed with a fixing member <b>153</b>. That is, the fixing member <b>153</b> is formed as an extension of the body <b>133</b>, and the presser foot <b>300</b> is fixed to the head <b>1</b> by the fixing member <b>153</b>. According to such a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the presser foot <b>300</b> may be manufactured by a simpler process and a manufacturing cost thereof may be decreased by reducing the number of parts in the presser foot <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Such a presser foot <b>300</b> according to the third exemplary embodiment is an example of the variety of variations of presser foot included within the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The presser foot <b>400</b> according to the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention is similar to the above-described presser feet <b>100</b>-<b>300</b>, and thus only the differences therefrom will be focused on in the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the first to third exemplary embodiments, the presser foot has one air exhaust passage. However, according to the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a presser foot <b>400</b> has two air exhaust passages <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>. The two air exhaust passages <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> provide large space for rapid exhaust of air. Further, passages <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> can reduce noises which are generally produced when fluid with high pressure is exhausted through a narrow outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that a presser foot according to the present invention may has two or more fluid exhaust passages according to a desired design of the presser foot. Further, the presser foot may be modified in various shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, according to embodiments of the present invention, a needle used for sewing a work material is cooled by a fluid, such as compressed air, and melted leavings from the work material, which is a thermally weak material, may be prevented from staining the sewn product. Therefore, the quality and productivity of a sewn product may be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be practical exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
