<p id="p-0008" num="0007">High bandwidth communication usage is increasing rapidly. In urban areas, fiber, cable, or wireless is typically linked to a central station and available. In rural areas, most users are still too far away from a central station to have high speed access. Fiber or cable may not reach out to the rural areas. With smaller demand, it may not be economical to lay fiber to these rural areas. Many rural houses are too far from a central box to be able to use DSL.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore there is a need for a different architecture for distributing high bandwidth communication signals to remote areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and the following description depict specific examples to teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the best mode of the invention. For the purpose of teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects have been simplified or omitted. Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from these examples that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optical fiber deployment from a telephone central office into residential subdivisions is rare. The capital cost to lay miles of fiber, as well as the disruption to auto traffic may not be justified by the initial network traffic level across the newly laid links. In one example embodiment of the invention, E-band wireless RF links are used to connect the subdivision, or targeted service area, to the central office or a central service node. In some cases an optical fiber link may extend from the central office or central service node, part way to the residential area or targeted service area. In these cases the E-band wireless RF links would be used to extend the optical fiber link out to the targeted service area. E-band wireless RF links typically operate at frequencies around 70-90 GHz allowing a capacity of approximately 1.5 Gbps, with future capacity up to approximately 10 Gbps per path link. E-band wireless links require a clear line of sight without foliage or obstructions of any kind. With the clear line of sight requirement, deploying the E-band links along the tops of existing electrical transmission line poles is one easy way to implement the deployment of the links. Each E-band link can typically travel between 1-2 miles, depending on the rain zone to achieve adequate all weather reliability. Multiple E-band links can be chained together to extend out to remote service areas, for example 20-40 miles or more.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Once the E-band link extends from the central service node out to the targeted service area the signals are distributed to the end user sites using a different technology. In one example embodiment of the invention, a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) is placed at the end of the E-band links. The DSLAM is coupled to phone lines and uses DSL across the phone lines to connect to the end user sites. Any type of DSL may be used including asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), asymmetric digital subscriber line 2 plus (ADSL2 plus), very-high-data-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL), or the like. In another example embodiment of the invention, a passive optical network is used to distribute the signals from the E-band links out to the individual end user sites.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of communication network <b>100</b> in one example embodiment of the current invention. Communication network <b>100</b> comprises a central service node <b>102</b>, an optical fiber link <b>104</b>, an E-band wireless RF link <b>106</b>, a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) <b>108</b>, a twisted pair network <b>110</b>, and a plurality of end user sites <b>112</b> inside a service area <b>114</b>. In one example embodiment of the invention, central service node <b>102</b> may only have a single switch and have basic capabilities, for example high speed voice or data communications. In another example embodiment of the invention, central service node <b>102</b> may have more advanced capabilities and comprise multiple switching exchanges, computer systems with mass storage, and the like. The more advanced central service node may provide a plurality of signals, for example voice, data, video, IP video programming, and the like. These signals are sent from central service node <b>102</b> across optical fiber link <b>104</b> to the E-band wireless RF link <b>106</b>. The plurality of signals are sent across the E-band wireless RF link <b>106</b> to the DSLAM <b>108</b>. The plurality of signals are distributed from the DSLAM <b>108</b> to the plurality of user sites <b>112</b> across the twisted pair network <b>110</b>. E-band wireless RF link <b>106</b> may be made up of one or more E-band links, where each E-band link spans up to 3 miles. The E-band links may be deployed along the poles of an existing electrical distribution system (not shown) or may be installed on new utility poles dedicated to the E-band link. In one example embodiment of the invention, the end user sites are residences. In another example embodiment of the invention, the E-band link <b>106</b> may connect directly to the central service node <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one example embodiment of the invention, some of the end user sites <b>112</b> may have satellite receivers (not shown). The end user sites that do have satellite receivers may receive some programming via satellite and other programming over the E-band wireless RF link.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a communication network <b>200</b> in one example embodiment of the current invention. Communication network <b>200</b> comprises a central service node <b>202</b>, an optical fiber link <b>204</b>, an E-band wireless RF link <b>206</b>, a passive optical network (PON) system cabinet <b>208</b>, a passive optical network <b>210</b>, and a plurality of end user sites <b>212</b> inside a service area <b>214</b>. In operation, a plurality of signals, for example voice, data, video, and the like, are sent from central service node <b>202</b> across optical fiber link <b>204</b> to the E-band wireless RF link <b>206</b>. The plurality of signals are sent across the E-band wireless RF link <b>206</b> to the passive optical network (PON) system cabinet <b>208</b>. The plurality of signals are distributed from the PON system cabinet <b>208</b> to the plurality of user sites <b>212</b> across PON <b>210</b>. PON <b>210</b> may be an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON). E-band wireless RF link <b>206</b> may be made up of one or more E-band links, where each E-band link spans 1 to 3 miles. The E-band links may be deployed along the poles of an existing electrical distribution system (not shown) or may be installed on new utility poles dedicated to the E-band link. In one example embodiment of the invention, the end user sites are residences. In another example embodiment of the invention, the E-band link <b>206</b> may connect directly to the central service node <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart for a method of distributing a plurality of signals to a plurality of end user sites in an example embodiment of the invention. At step <b>302</b> a plurality of signals are distributed from a central service node to a first location using an E-band wireless RF link deployed along an electrical power transmission line. At step <b>304</b> the plurality of signals are distributed from the first located to a plurality of user sites across a passive optical network.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some cases the initial traffic level may not justify installing a passive optical network to distribute the signals to the end user sites. In these cases phone lines may be used to distribute the signals from the E-band links until the traffic level reaches a level that justifies adding the PON.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart for a method of deploying a high speed communication network to a remote service area. At step <b>402</b> a central service node is connected to a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) placed in the remote service area using one or more E-band wireless RF links. If the central service node is linked to an optical fiber that extends part way to the remote service area, the E-band wireless RF links may couple to the optical fiber. The E-band links may be placed on the utility poles of an existing electrical transmission line or may be installed on new utility poles dedicated to the E-band links. At step <b>404</b> the DSLAM is connected to one or more end user sites in the service area using phone lines. The DSLAM may use a DSL link across the phone lines. Any type of DSL may be used including asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), asymmetric digital subscriber line 2 plus (ADSL2 plus), very-high-data-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL), or the like. The traffic flowing through the network is monitored in step <b>406</b>. The traffic may be monitored at each user site, through the DSLAM, through the entire network, or the like. When the traffic level reaches a first threshold, at step <b>408</b> a passive optical network system cabinet is added to the system and a passive optical network (PON) is run to at least one of the end user sites. The PON may be used to replace all or just some of the links to the end user site. The decision to replace an existing DSL link with the PON may be dependent on the traffic level from the user site, the cost of running the optical fiber, the length of the link, or the like. At step <b>410</b>, when the traffic through the network reaches a second threshold the E-band wireless RF link is replaced with an optical fiber. The first and second threshold may be the same traffic level or different traffic levels. When the first and second thresholds are the same level, the E-band links would be replaced at the same time that the PON is added to the system.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one example embodiment of the invention, a PON would be used at step <b>404</b> instead of a DSLAM. A PON may be used initially due to a higher traffic level, where the end user sites are distributed across a larger geographic area, or the like.</p>
