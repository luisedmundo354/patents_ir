<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to the refurbishing of lamp surfaces. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for removing surface wear and scratches in the lamp surface to return the lamp surface as near as possible to its original optical quality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a motor vehicle is in an accident and a lamp is damaged, it is often times replaced. Lamps are very expensive parts to insure and replace. In many situations, the lamp is not broken; it is scratched severely enough to warrant the replacement thereof. The scratches affect the aesthetic quality of the lamp, as well as its performance. Scratches divert light from the direction in which the lamp is designed to emit light, reducing the performance of the lamp. In addition, some scratches in the lamp surface may misdirect enough light as to cause a distraction to those peripheral to the lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/804,435 published on Sep. 22, 2005 discloses a method for refurbishing a headlamp surface. This method includes multiple steps of grinding the headlamp surface in a constant movement and oscillating motion using a machine designed specifically this purpose. In addition, there is a constant supply of water that is poured over the headlamp surface as the headlamp surface is being refurbished. The water is used to remove debris from the headlamp surface and to cool the headlamp surface as it is being sanded. This method causes two problems. First, the water transmits the debris from the headlamp surface onto the vehicle creating an opportunity for the portion of the motor vehicle below the headlamp to be damaged by subsequently wiping down of the motor vehicle after the sanding is completed. Second, the water required to remove the debris and cool the headlamp surface spills onto the floor creating an adverse work environment. This method creates a messy environment that may increase the probability of workplace injuries due to a wet floor. Third, this method requires the use of a dedicated sanding device that cannot be used for any other purpose. And finally, this method of undesirable because it refurbishes the headlamp surface while the headlamp is still mounted to the motor vehicle. Grinding a headlamp surface while the headlamp is still mounted in the motor vehicle may cause damage to the motor vehicle. In particular, mistakes made by the operator of the method may accidentally grind the motor vehicle should the operator miscalculate forces being applied to the headlamp surface. Slipping while grinding is also a high probability given the amount of water on the floor directly below the headlamp assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a cross-sectional view, partially cut away, of a lamp surface <b>10</b> is shown to have an original clear coat surface <b>12</b>. For purposes of this discussion, the reference to “original” means the clear coat surface at the time that damage occurs. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a lamp surface <b>10</b> may be refurbished more than once in which case clear coat surfaces intermediate in time may be referred to as the original clear coat surface <b>12</b> for purposes of this discussion. The lamp surface <b>10</b> includes damage <b>14</b>. The damage <b>14</b> is a scratch that extends through the original clear coat surface <b>12</b> and into the lamp surface <b>10</b>. The damage <b>14</b> may be any type of damage that does not extend through the entire depth of the lamp surface <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the inventive method designed to remove the damage <b>14</b> from the lamp surface <b>10</b> is generally indicated at <b>16</b>. The inventive method <b>16</b> is a method for refurbishing the lamp surface <b>10</b> of a lamp that has the surface damage <b>14</b>. The method begins at <b>18</b> with the removal of the lamp from the motor vehicle at <b>18</b>. Once removed, the housing and tabs thereof are checked for damage at <b>20</b>. The housing is checked for damage because the lamp is going to be placed into a jig for subsequent refurbishing. If the lamp housing is damaged, the jig may further damage the housing rendering refurbishing process unnecessary. Once it has been determined that the lamp housing is intact, the lamp surface <b>10</b> is cleaned at <b>22</b>. The original clear coat surface <b>12</b> of the lamp surface <b>10</b> is cleaned using a steaming process that steams the clear coat surface <b>12</b> using a solution with a primary ingredient of sodium laureth sulphate and a secondary ingredient of ammonium lauryl sulphate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Once cleaned, the clear coat surface <b>12</b> and any exposed lamp surface <b>10</b> are dried of the solvent using high pressure air that is blown over the clear coat surface <b>12</b> and the lamp surface <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The original clear coat surface <b>12</b> is then removed at <b>24</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a more detailed view of the removal of the original clear coat surface <b>24</b> is generally shown at <b>26</b>. The removal of the original clear coat finish <b>12</b> starts with a step of grinding the clear coat finish with a course grit sandpaper at <b>28</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the range of grit for the step of grinding the original clear coat finish is in the range of 320 and 240 grit. If the damage <b>14</b> is severe, the courser grit sandpaper, e.g., 240 grit sandpaper, can be used. If the damage <b>14</b> is minimal, the lower grade of course sandpaper, e.g., 320 sandpaper, may be used. A mini angle grinder is used to remove the original clear coat finish <b>12</b>. The mini angle grinder would incorporate the use of a three inch foam loop pad along with the course grit sandpaper. The mini angle grinder rotates the course grit sandpaper at approximately 7000 revolutions per minute. When grinding the original clear coat finish <b>12</b>, a halo effect will be created differentiated between the different thicknesses of the original clear coat finish <b>12</b> as it is being ground off the lamp surface <b>10</b>. Thus, it can be confirmed that the original clear coat finish <b>12</b> is fully removed from the lamp surface <b>10</b> when the halo effect approaches the edges of the lamp surface <b>10</b>. If the lamp surface <b>10</b> has deeper scratches, additional work in localized areas may be needed to more fully remove the scratch from the lamp surface <b>10</b>. Once the original clear coat finish <b>12</b> is removed and the damage <b>14</b> is removed from the lamp surface <b>10</b>, subsequent steps may be taken to prepare the lamp surface <b>10</b> for restoring it to its original equipment condition.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">After the damage <b>14</b> has been removed, the lamp surface <b>10</b> is evened at <b>30</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the evening of the lamp surface <b>10</b> includes the step of grinding the lamp surface <b>10</b> with a sandpaper having a grit of approximately 320, at <b>32</b>. The lamp surface <b>10</b> is smoothed out as much as possible so that, if any troughs are created through the removal of the damage <b>14</b>, they are minimized. The resulting lamp surface <b>10</b> will be substantially similar to the contour of the original lamp surface <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the step of evening out the lamp surface <b>10</b>, scratches and swirls may be created in the lamp surface <b>10</b>. The next step of the inventive method <b>16</b> is to grind the swirls and scratches out of the lamp surface <b>10</b>. This is done at step <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the grinding out of the swirls and scratches is shown at <b>36</b> to be done with a sandpaper having a grit of approximately 600 grit. Once the use of 600 grit sandpaper has been completed, the step of removing the swirls and scratches continues with grinding out the swirls and scratches using a second sandpaper having a grit of approximately 1200 grit at <b>38</b>. This further removes any swirls and scratches that may remain or that were created from the use of the 600 grit sandpaper in step <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">All through the grinding steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cutting solution is applied to each of the sandpapers and is used to absorb thermal energy during the steps of grinding. This is shown graphically at step <b>40</b>. The cutting solution is water mixed with a generic detergent. This is not a free flowing solution, but one that is applied and absorbed by the sandpaper so that it is present during the grinding process. It does not create a flowing stream of cutting solution that drips over a jig or other holding device that would be used to hold the lamp while the lamp surface <b>10</b> is being ground. The application of the cutting solution is done on an add-need basis. It may be that one or more of the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> do not include the application of the cutting solution because the damage is not so great that it requires sanding to the point that it generates thermal energy that might damage the lamp surface <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lamp surface <b>10</b> is buffed at <b>42</b>. The buffing includes the use of a wool buffing pad, followed by the use of a foam pad.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Subsequent to buffing, the lamp surface <b>10</b> is cleaned at <b>44</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the step of cleaning the lamp <b>44</b> is generally indicated. The cleaning process starts with the steaming of the lamp surface <b>10</b> at <b>46</b>. The lamp is then blown dry at <b>48</b>. To further clean the lamp surface <b>10</b>, the lamp surface <b>10</b> is statically neutralized at <b>50</b>. By neutralizing the lamp surface <b>10</b> to all static energy, particulate from the grinding and buffing steps may be more easily removed. A solvent is applied to the lamp surface <b>10</b> at <b>52</b> whereafter the lamp surface <b>52</b> is statically neutralized for a second time at <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Returning attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the inventive method <b>16</b> continues with the application of a replacement clear coat material over the lamp surface <b>10</b> at <b>56</b>. The application of the replacement clear coat is applied using a spraying technology to evenly coat the lamp surface <b>10</b> with the replacement clear coat <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once applied, the replacement clear coat material <b>58</b> is cured at <b>60</b>. The curing process <b>58</b> is done by having the replacement clear coat surface <b>58</b> receive infrared radiation. The material used to create the replacement clear coat surface <b>58</b> is sold by assignee under the trademark MAGNI <b>700</b>, which requires enough infrared radiation typically found in an oven at a temperature of 230° F. ±40° F. for approximately 45 minutes to 60 minutes. An ultraviolet radiation cure could also be used to cure the MAGNI <b>700</b> material.
