<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a heat dissipation device, and particularly to a heat dissipation device for an integrated circuit package.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Continuing development of integrated circuit technology has rendered integrated circuit packages (IC packages) such as central processing units (CPUs) to operate at a higher and higher speed. Heat generated by these modern IC packages has increased commensurately. Accumulation of heat will result in an increasing of temperature of the IC packages, and consequently result in instability of operation or even damage of the IC packages. For above reason, the heat must be efficiently removed in order to maintain a normal operation of the IC packages.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various heat sink configurations for heat dissipation of IC packages are developed. Along with continuous increase of heat-generating, conventional heat sinks dissipating heat merely by natural metal thermal conduction have not met the requirement of heat dissipation of the heat-generating IC packages. In recent years, heat pipes have been widely used due to their fast heat-transferring capacity. Accordingly, heat sinks using heat pipes are more and more popular.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical heat sink with heat pipes is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the heat sink has a base <b>100</b>, two vertical U-shaped heat pipes <b>200</b> installed on the base <b>100</b> and a plurality of parallel fins <b>300</b> through which the heat pipes <b>200</b> extend. The heat sink absorbs heat generated by an IC package (not shown) by the base <b>100</b>. The heat on the base <b>100</b> is speedily transferred, via the heat pipes <b>200</b>, to the fins <b>300</b> for further heat dissipation to avoid overheating of the IC package.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To maximize heat dissipation surface area, the fins are made to have large sizes, however, a heat pipe <b>200</b> usually has a small diameter. So, contacting area between the heat pipes and the fins is not enough to establish a satisfactory heat connection. On the other hand, each large-sized fin is supported by the heat pipes only at several points and all the fins are isolated to each other. The fins <b>300</b> cannot have a robust structure. When a fan is used for providing a forced airflow through the fins <b>300</b> to facilitate heat removal, vibration and noise generated by the fins <b>300</b> are unavoidable. The vibration will be partly transferred to the base <b>100</b> of the heat sink and even to the IC package, thereby adversely impacting normal operation of the IC package, such as stability or life span thereof. The noise is more considerable and insufferable when a resonant vibration occurs. So it is necessary to improve the heat sink to remove said disadvantage and gain a high heat dissipation performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is desired to evolve a heat dissipation device to overcome above-mentioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, what is needed is a heat dissipation device having a strong structure and a high heat dissipation performance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A heat dissipation device in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a base, a heat dissipation member comprising two heat-dissipating plate groups intercrossed with each other so as to define a plurality of passages arranged in a matrix having a plurality of rows and columns, and a heat pipe connecting the base with the heat dissipation member to transfer heat from the base to the heat dissipation member. A first heat sink and a second heat sink cooperate with the heat dissipation member and sandwich the heat dissipation member therebetween.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference will now be made to the drawing figures to describe a heat dissipation device in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The heat dissipation device is for being mounted to an heat-generating electronic device, such as an IC package (not shown), to dissipate heat therefrom. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the heat dissipation device comprises a base <b>10</b> for contacting the electronic device to absorb heat therefrom, a heat dissipation member <b>20</b> for dissipating heat, three U-shaped heat pipes <b>50</b> connecting the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> with the base <b>10</b> for transferring heat from the base to the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>. A first heat sink <b>30</b> and a second heat sink <b>40</b> are respectively connected to two lateral sides (not labeled) of the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> and sandwich the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The base <b>10</b>, generally being made of cooper and a rectangle flat plate, has a bottom face (not shown) for contacting the electronic device, and a top face <b>12</b> which is opposite to the bottom face and define three parallel grooves <b>13</b> therein. Four fixing legs <b>14</b>, each defining a mounting hole (not labeled), extend respectively from four corners of the base <b>10</b>. Bolts <b>60</b> with springs (not labeled) thereon extend through the holes of the fixing legs <b>14</b> for securing the heat dissipation device to a substrate (not shown) on which the electronic device is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The heat pipes <b>50</b> each comprise an evaporating portion <b>52</b> received in a corresponding groove <b>13</b> of the base <b>10</b> and two parallel condensing portions <b>54</b> extending perpendicularly upwardly from opposite ends of the evaporating portion <b>52</b>. The evaporating portions <b>52</b> are thermally connected with the base <b>10</b> and a bottom of the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> when the base <b>10</b>, the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> and the heat pipes <b>50</b> are assembled together. The condensing portions <b>54</b> of each heat pipe <b>50</b> extend away from and perpendicular to the base <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Particularly referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> comprises two parallel heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> which are perpendicular to the base <b>10</b> and located at the two lateral sides of the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>, a plurality of first heat-dissipating plates <b>23</b> which are parallel to the base <b>10</b> and connect the two heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and a plurality of second heat-dissipating plates <b>25</b> which are perpendicularly intercrossed with the first heat-dissipating plates <b>23</b> and located between the heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Each of the heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> defines three grooves <b>29</b> in an outer lateral face thereof. The first heat-dissipating plates <b>23</b> are perpendicular to the heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the second heat-dissipating plates <b>25</b> are parallel to the heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The first heat-dissipating plate <b>23</b> and the second heat-dissipating plate <b>25</b> therefore define a plurality of parallel air passages <b>27</b> between the two heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and each air passage <b>27</b> has two opposite ventilating ports, i.e., front and rear ventilating ports (not labeled) and a square cross section. Top and bottom ones of the heat-dissipating plates <b>23</b> and the two heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> jointly form an outline border for the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>. The first and second heat-dissipating plates <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> are interweaved together. The air passages <b>27</b> are arranged as having a plurality of rows and columns in the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>. The heat dissipation member <b>20</b>, including the first and second heat-dissipating plates <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> and the spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are integrally fabricated by metal extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first heat sink <b>30</b> and the second heat sink <b>40</b> are constructed in the same manner. The first heat sink <b>30</b> comprises a conductive plate <b>32</b> connected with the heat spreader <b>22</b>. The conductive plate <b>32</b> has a heat-absorbing face (not labeled) mating with the lateral face of the heat spreader <b>22</b> and a heat-dissipating face (not labeled) opposite to the heat-absorbing face. The heat-absorbing face of the conductive plate <b>32</b> defines three grooves <b>33</b> corresponding to the grooves <b>29</b> of the heat spreader <b>22</b>. The grooves <b>29</b>, <b>33</b> jointly form three channels in which the condensing portions <b>54</b> of the heat pipes <b>50</b> extend. The heat-dissipating face of the conductive plate <b>32</b> forms a plurality of first fins <b>35</b> extending laterally and outwardly, parallel to the base <b>10</b>. The second heat sink <b>40</b> comprises a conductive plate <b>42</b> connected with the heat spreader <b>24</b>. The conductive plate <b>42</b> has a heat-absorbing face (not labeled) mating with the lateral face of the heat spreader <b>24</b> and a heat-dissipating face (not labeled) opposite to the heat-absorbing face.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the heat dissipation device applied to the heat-generating electronic device, the base <b>10</b> contacts the electronic device and absorbs heat therefrom. The heat is partly conducted to the bottom portion of the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> and travels upwardly. A majority of the heat is absorbed by the evaporating portions <b>52</b> of the heat pipes <b>50</b>, travels along the heat pipe <b>50</b>, and are transferred to the heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the two heat sinks <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> via the condensing portions <b>54</b> of the heat pipes <b>50</b> for being dissipated out by the heat dissipating plates <b>23</b>, <b>25</b> and the fins <b>35</b>, <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first heat-dissipating plates <b>23</b> and the second heat-dissipating plates <b>25</b> of the dissipation member <b>20</b> are intercrossed with each other. Each first heat-dissipating plate <b>23</b> is anchored by a plurality of second heat-dissipating plates <b>25</b> that are intercrossed with the first heat-dissipating plate <b>23</b>, so is each second heat-dissipating plate <b>25</b>. So, the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> has a solid heat-dissipating plate structure. When a forced airflow passes through the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>, noise and vibration is effectively diminished. On the other hand, the intercrossed heat-dissipating plate configuration avails to form an even and smooth heat distribution in the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>. Utilization of the heat dissipation member <b>20</b> increases; accordingly heat dissipation performance of the heat dissipation device is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In said embodiment of the present invention, the heat pipes <b>50</b> are sandwiched between the first and second heat sinks <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> and the heat spreaders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> instead of extending through the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>, which makes the heat dissipation device to be easily manufactured. A good heat-transferring between the heat pipes <b>50</b> and the heat dissipation member <b>20</b>, the heat sinks <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> can be established, accordingly, heat dissipation performance of the heat dissipation device is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is believed that the present invention and its advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p>
