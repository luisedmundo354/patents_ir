<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is the U.S. national stage application of International Application PCT/NO03/00092, filed Mar. 18, 2003, which international application was published on Oct. 2, 2003 as International Publication WO 03/081047. The International Application claims priority of Norwegian Patent Application 20021434, filed Mar. 21, 2002.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention regards a valve arrangement for reciprocating machinery such as a pump and a compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reciprocating machinery, or a reciprocating engine, typically has an induction valve and an exhaust valve, hereinafter termed in-valve and out-valve, for each piston. Normally, springloaded one-way valves are used, where a spring closes the valve by forcing a valve body against a valve seat. A valve may be opened for flow either through mechanical action or by pressure in the working medium of the reciprocating engine, hereinafter termed fluid, acting on the valve body to generate a force directed opposite to the force from said spring.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">If valves of the type in question are arranged so that the direction of flow through the valves is parallel with the cylinder axis of the reciprocating engine, the valves and attached pipework project a relatively long way from the cylinder head of the reciprocating engine. Therefore it is desirable to mount the valves in a manner such that fluid may flow across the cylinder axis immediately outside the cylinder head. If fluid is to flow to and from the cylinder in parallel with the cylinder axis, the direction of fluid flow must change in connection with the valve arrangement. Such a change in direction results in lateral flow forces that act on the valve body and cause misalignment of this. The result is skewed or uneven wear on the valve body and the valve seat, which causes leakage in a closed valve. In the event of such leakage the valve in question must be replaced, or the valve must be disassembled and the worn parts replaced. Changing valves or worn valve components may be time consuming, particularly in the case of large reciprocating machinery such as a reciprocating pump for drill fluid for use in drilling of petroleum wells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the invention to provide a valve arrangement for reciprocating machinery, where the flow forces cause little or no misalignment of the valve body. It is a further object to simplify the work involved in changing valves.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The objects are achieved by the characteristics given in the following description and in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the invention, two springloaded one-way valves that are known per se, one in-valve and one out-valve, are mounted in a spaced-apart manner in a tubular sleeve, so that the axial direction of flow is the same for both valves. The in-valve is arranged in the sleeve at the first end of this, which forms the inlet end of the sleeve. The out-valve is arranged in the sleeve at the second end of this, the outlet end.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The valves divide the sleeve into three chambers; an inlet chamber between the first end of the sleeve and the valve seat of the in-valve, a working chamber between the valve seat of the in-valve and the valve seat of the out-valve, and an outlet chamber between the valve seat of the out-valve and the second end of the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">At the working chamber the sleeve wall is equipped with a first perforated area having through openings for the fluid to flow radially into or out of the sleeve. At the outlet chamber the sleeve wall is equipped with a second perforated area, so as to allow fluid to flow radially out of the sleeves as well.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sleeve with the valves is designed to be installed in a bore in the cylinder head of a reciprocating engine or in a casing that is connected to or forms part of a cylinder head. An external annular gasket at either end of the sleeve and a similar intermediate gasket define two annuli between the sleeve and the bore, the diameter of the bore being enlarged between sealing surfaces against which said gaskets provide a seal. Thus a working annulus is defined between a gasket at the first end of the sleeve and said intermediate gasket. Similarly, an outlet annulus is defined between a gasket at the second end of the sleeve and the intermediate gasket. Advantageously the sleeve has a smaller outside diameter between the gaskets, as this will facilitate the mounting and dismounting of the sleeve. It will also help increase the cross sectional area of the annuli.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A first passage in the casing (or the cylinder head) constitutes an inlet for fluid and leads to the first end of the bore, i.e. to the inlet end of the sleeve when the sleeve is installed in the bore. Advantageously the passage is axial with respect to the sleeve and the bore. A second passage in the casing constitutes a working passage and connects said first annulus, the working annulus, with the cylinder of the reciprocating engine. The working passage is typically perpendicular or near perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bore. A third passage in the casing forms the outlet for fluid from the second annulus, the outlet annulus. The outlet is typically perpendicular or near perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bore. Thus the working passage and the outlet are radially oriented with respect to the bore, and the working passage and the outlet may have different radial orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The working annulus is positioned eccentrically with respect to the axis of the bore. The distance between the sleeve and the periphery of the working annulus is at its greatest where the working passage ends, and at its smallest at the diametrically opposite side of the working passage.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The outlet annulus exhibits corresponding eccentricity with respect to the axis of the bore. The distance between the sleeve and the periphery of the outlet annulus is at its greatest where the outlet joins the working, and at its smallest at the diametrically opposite side of the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sleeve is installed in the bore through being inserted into the bore through the second end of this, until it abuts a step in the bore or the bottom of the bore at the first end of the bore, whereupon the second end of the bore is sealed with a cover. The cover may be executed with an abutment that projects into the bore and presses against the second end of the sleeve, keeping the sleeve fixed in the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Fluid flows radially between the working chamber of the sleeve and the working annulus outside. The fluid flow is uniformly distributed, so that no lateral forces occur which may misalign the valve body of the in-valve. Similarly, fluid flows out of the outlet chamber to the outlet annulus in a radial and uniformly distributed manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">By the arrangement described, the valves of a reciprocating engine can easily be replaced by dismantling the cover, pulling out the sleeve with the valves, installing a new sleeve with valves and finally fitting the cover. It is also easy to test valves for set pressure and sealing effect in a test installation outside the reciprocating engine, as the sleeve may be arranged in a bore in a casing in which the inlet and the working passage are connected to a pressure source.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When a valve arrangement in accordance with the invention is used in a reciprocating engine in which a piston cyclically executes an induction stroke followed by a power stroke, fluid will, upon the induction stroke, flow via the casing inlet to the first end of the sleeve, into the sleeve via the in-valve and radially out of the casing to the working passage and on to the cylinder of the reciprocating engine. On the subsequent power stroke fluid flows from the cylinder via the working passage to the working annulus, and then radially through the first perforated area of the sleeve and into the sleeve, whereupon the fluid then continues axially through the out-valve and then radially out of the sleeve via the openings in the second perforated area to the outlet annulus, and from there to the outlet.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The casing <b>8</b> is provided with threaded holes <b>64</b> for fixing the casing <b>8</b> to the cylinder <b>3</b> and to the assembly plate <b>5</b> with the screws <b>7</b>. Furthermore, the casing <b>8</b> is provided with threaded holes <b>65</b> for connecting an inlet pipe (not shown) to the casing <b>8</b>, so as to allow said inlet pipe to communicate with the inlet <b>11</b>. Similarly, the casing <b>8</b> is provided with threaded holes (not shown) for connecting an outlet pipe (not shown) to the casing <b>8</b>, to allow said outlet pipe to communicate with the outlet <b>15</b>. At the free end of the bore <b>9</b> the casing <b>8</b> is provided with threaded holes <b>65</b> for fixing the cover <b>13</b> with screws <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to simplify the installation of the sleeve <b>16</b> in the bore <b>9</b> and to help avoid damage to the gaskets and sealing surfaces, the first cylindrical section <b>59</b> of the bore <b>9</b> should have a smaller diameter than the third cylindrical section <b>61</b> of the bore <b>9</b>, which in turn should have a smaller diameter than the fifth cylindrical section <b>63</b> of the bore <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The supporting ring <b>17</b> and the sleeve <b>16</b> with the valves <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are fitted in the bore <b>9</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the cover <b>13</b> is fitted on the casing <b>8</b>, covering the free end of the bore <b>9</b>. The stub <b>44</b> on the cover <b>13</b> projects into the bore <b>9</b> and into the sleeve <b>16</b>, abutting the valve guide <b>28</b> of the out-valve <b>19</b> and the second end <b>33</b> of the sleeve <b>16</b>. Thus the cover <b>13</b> forces the sleeve <b>16</b> against the supporting ring <b>17</b>, which rests against the bottom of the bore <b>9</b>. The valve seat <b>20</b> of the in-valve <b>18</b> is thereby forced against the in-valve body <b>21</b>, so as to tension the spring <b>24</b>. At the same time, the cover <b>13</b> forces the valve guide <b>28</b> of the out-valve <b>19</b> into the sleeve <b>16</b>, so that the valve spring <b>30</b> is tensioned against the valve body <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the sleeve <b>16</b> with the in-valve <b>18</b> and the out-valve <b>19</b> is installed in the bore <b>9</b> in the casing <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the eccentrically positioned bore sections <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> form eccentric annuli outside the sleeve <b>16</b>. The largest cross section of the annuli is on the side facing the working passage <b>14</b> and the outlet <b>15</b> respectively, and the smallest cross section is at the diametrically opposite side of said passages.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the piston pump <b>2</b> is operating, fluid at the inlet is transported via the valve arrangement <b>1</b> and the cylinder <b>3</b> to the outlet <b>15</b>, where the fluid is delivered at a higher pressure that of the inlet <b>11</b>. The induction stroke of the piston <b>4</b> reduces the pressure in the cylinder <b>3</b> and thereby also the pressure in the first sleeve chamber <b>48</b>, to allow the pressure differential across the valve body <b>21</b> of the in-valve <b>18</b> to overcome the force from the valve spring <b>24</b> and push the valve body <b>21</b> away from the valve seat <b>20</b>. The out-valve <b>19</b> is closed. Fluid flows from the inlet <b>11</b> past the valve seat <b>20</b>, into the first sleeve chamber <b>48</b> and then radially out of the sleeve chamber <b>48</b> via the holes <b>51</b> to the cylinder <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the piston <b>4</b> then executes a power stroke, the in-valve <b>18</b> closes and the fluid pressure in the cylinder <b>3</b> increases until the pressure differential across the valve body <b>27</b> of the out-valve <b>19</b> overcomes the force from the valve spring <b>30</b>, pushing the valve body <b>27</b> away from the valve seat <b>26</b> and opening the out-valve <b>19</b>. Fluid flows from the cylinder <b>3</b> via the holes <b>50</b>, radially into the first sleeve chamber <b>48</b>, past the valve seat <b>26</b> of the out-valve <b>19</b> to the second sleeve chamber <b>49</b>, and radially out of this via the holes <b>51</b> to the outlet <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Upon reciprocating movement of the piston <b>4</b> the casing <b>8</b> and the sleeve <b>16</b> are subjected to varying pressure and thereby to a varying load.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus it can be mentioned that upon the power stroke of the piston <b>4</b> the sleeve <b>16</b> is subjected to a first axial force against a first annular area defined by the diameter of the sealing surfaces of the first gasket <b>40</b> and the fourth gasket <b>52</b>, and a second, opposite directed axial force against a second annular area defined by the diameter of the sealing surfaces of the third gasket <b>45</b> and the sixth gasket <b>56</b>. The sleeve <b>16</b> is thereby subjected to an axial tensile force between said annular areas. The dimensions should be selected so as to make the net force, i.e. the difference between the numerical values of the first and second axial forces, push the first end <b>32</b> of the sleeve <b>16</b> against the supporting ring <b>17</b>. The area at the first end <b>32</b> of the sleeve <b>16</b> is then subjected to a compressive force corresponding to said net force.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Upon the induction stroke of the piston <b>4</b> only the area between the second gasket <b>42</b> and the third/sixth gasket <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> is exposed to the operating pressure of the pump <b>2</b>. As the force against the valve body <b>27</b> of the out-valve <b>19</b> is taken up by the sleeve <b>16</b>, the area between the second gasket <b>42</b> and the third gasket <b>45</b> is exposed to tension. The area between the second gasket <b>42</b> and the first end <b>32</b> of the sleeve <b>16</b> is subjected to a compressive force determined by the operating pressure and the diameter of the bore <b>9</b> at the sealing surface of the second gasket <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The area between the second and third gaskets <b>42</b>, <b>45</b> is thereby subjected to a varying tensile force. The area between the first and second gaskets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> alternates between tensile and compressive force. The area between the first gasket <b>40</b> and the first end <b>32</b> of the sleeve <b>16</b> is subjected to a varying compressive force. A person skilled in the art will, based on this, be able to dimension the casing <b>8</b>, the supporting ring <b>8</b> and the sleeve <b>16</b> so as to resist the varying loads.</p>
