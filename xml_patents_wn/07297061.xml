<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the video game industry, there are several different types of game controllers or video game pads for video games. Video game players use the video game controllers to control and manipulate different functions or operations in the video games. The video game controllers typically include different controls or input devices such as buttons, triggers or joysticks to control these operations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional video game controllers include at least one joystick for allowing a player to operate and play a video game, such as for moving, looking and steering in various directions within the game. A typical joystick includes only a single or normal mode of operation. For example, a joystick of a conventional controller is configured such that when a player moves or pushes the joystick upwardly and downwardly, respectively, the game responds by moving up and down, respectively. Players, however, often prefer controlling the video game in the opposite manner. That is, some players prefer moving the joystick upwardly and downwardly to result in the game moving down and up, respectively, similar to the directional movements made when flying an airplane. The conventional controllers do not include mechanisms for providing an opposite or inverted mode of operation in addition to the normal mode of operation. As a result, any dual mode operation capability must be setup or incorporated into the video game software. The setup is often complicated, time consuming and generally requires players to pause or quit a game to switch operation modes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, to accommodate different preferences of players, there is a need for a video game controller that enables players to quickly and easily switch between different modes of operation such as between a normal mode and an inverted mode.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to a game controller used with a video game systems such as XBOX® or PlayStation® systems. The game controller enables a player to switch between multiple control or operational modes such as a normal mode and an inverted mode, for operating and controlling the video game system using the game controller.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the game controller includes a switch mechanism having a switch such as a mechanical switch or the like which enables a player to switch between different modes of operation of at least one control device on the game controller associated with the video game system. The switch mechanism is located on the game controller and enables a player to switch from one mode of operation to another mode of operation to change the operation of one or more control devices on the game controller.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, a control device connected to the game controller includes two modes of operation, a normal or default mode of operation and an invert or inverted mode of operation. In the normal or default mode of operation, a player moves the control device, such as a joystick, forward or upward to move a corresponding indicator or other component on a video game display upward. Similarly, the player moves the joystick downward or backward to move the corresponding indicator on the video game display downward.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conversely, in the inverted or invert mode, the player moves the joystick upward or forward to move the corresponding indicator downward or down on the video game display. Alternatively, the player moves the joystick downward or backward to move the corresponding indicator upward or up on the video game display. Therefore, the invert or inverted mode enables a player to move a control device such as a joystick to move an indicator or other component on a video display in the opposite directions to the movements of the indicator associated with the normal mode on the video game display.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the present invention enables a player to simply move the switch on the game controller from the normal mode to the invert mode or from the invert mode to the normal mode to switch the mode of operation to a players' desired mode of operation for the control device. As a result, the player may switch modes of operation before, during or after the player plays a game on a video game system. The present invention is significantly easier and simpler to use than known devices and methods for switching modes of operation because the known devices employ complex set up procedures which are often performed by pausing or quitting a game.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the game controller includes a control such as a joystick and a switch which enables the player to switch from one mode of operation to the another mode of operation for the joystick. In another embodiment, the game controller includes a plurality of control devices such as a plurality of joysticks and a plurality of switches where each switch enables the player to switch the mode of operation for each joystick. In a further embodiment, the game controller includes a plurality of controls or joysticks and a single switch which switches the mode of operation for each of the joysticks when the player switches the mode of operation using the switch. It should be appreciated that any suitable number of controls or joysticks and switches may be employed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, an advantage of the present invention is to provide a game controller that enables a player to change between different modes of operation for the control device and bypass complicated setup procedures associated with the game.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a control device for a game controller including dual modes of operation that allows a player to choose between the dual modes of operation by actuating a switch conveniently located on the game controller.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, a game controller <b>100</b> of the present invention operates a video game system. In particular, the game controller <b>100</b> communicates with a game console <b>120</b> of the video game system (not shown) to operate a game, as is well known in the art. Generally, game controller <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>101</b> having a top member <b>102</b> and a bottom member <b>104</b> that includes at least one control or control device, but preferably includes multiple control devices such as first and second controls or first and second joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b</i>, and supports electronics therein including a microprocessor <b>124</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which communicates with the game software <b>121</b> associated with the game console <b>120</b>, using at least one electrical connector or electrical connection. The top housing <b>102</b> include openings or slots such as openings <b>115</b><i>a </i>and <b>115</b><i>b </i>that correspond to each of the control devices <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b</i>. The top housing <b>102</b> connects to or is otherwise attached to bottom housing <b>104</b> to enclose the internal components of the game controller such as the microprocessor <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, a decorative cover <b>105</b> is attached to the outside of at least the top housing <b>102</b> and includes openings that correspond to the size and shape of the control devices on the game controller. The decorative cover may be made using a suitable material such as rubber, plastic or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the first and second joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b </i>output analog data corresponding to the direction (e.g. up, down, right, left) of the joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b </i>as the joysticks are operated by a player of the video game. The analog data from joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b </i>is converted to digital data and communicated to the microprocessor <b>124</b> of game controller <b>100</b> which in turn communicates with the video game software <b>121</b> to operate the game.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the game controller <b>100</b> includes a switch mechanism <b>110</b> for switching between different modes of operation (i.e., normal/default mode and the invert mode) for a control device, which enables a player to choose between the different modes of operation. For example, in the normal or default mode, actuating the control device or joystick <b>106</b><i>b </i>upwardly directs a corresponding indicator, icon or the like on the video game display <b>122</b> upwardly, and likewise, actuating the joystick <b>106</b><i>b </i>downwardly directs the indicator downwardly on the display <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Conversely, in the invert or inverted mode, actuating the joystick downwardly directs the indicator of the video game upwardly on the display and actuating the joystick upwardly directs the indicator of the video game downwardly on the display, similar to the control device of an airplane. It should be appreciated that normal and invert modes can be set for either of the above operations as long as the normal and invert modes result in opposite responses of an indicator or indicators in the video game, respectively, when a player is operating joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>or <b>106</b><i>b </i>of the game controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also, it should be appreciated that the switch mechanism <b>110</b> may be associated with any directional movement associated with a video game, such as up, down, left, right or diagonal directions or any other suitable directional movement of a control device. In one embodiment, the normal mode directs an indicator of a video game to the right and left in response to actuation of the joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>or <b>106</b><i>b </i>to the right and left, respectively, and the inverted mode directs the indicator of the video game to the left and right in response to actuation of the joysticks <b>106</b> or <b>106</b><i>b </i>to the left and right, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, switch mechanism <b>110</b> includes switch housing <b>116</b> and a switch such as mechanical switch <b>114</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C) connected to the switch housing, where the switch <b>114</b> is operated by a player of the video game to achieve the preferred mode of operation for the control device. In one embodiment, switch <b>114</b> employs a hardware “flag” that electrically communicates with the microprocessor <b>124</b> of game controller <b>100</b> via one or more electrical connectors <b>118</b> to indicate which mode of operation has been selected by a player. In particular, the player physically moves the switch <b>114</b> to either the normal or default mode, or to the invert or inverted mode. The switch <b>114</b> then communicates the player's selection to microprocessor <b>124</b>. Switch <b>114</b> remains in a constant state (i.e., normal or invert mode) until the player subsequently moves the switch <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment, switch <b>114</b> employs a software flag. In this embodiment, switch <b>114</b> temporarily remains in either the normal or invert states or modes. The microprocessor <b>124</b> is programmed to recognize the state, mode or position of switch <b>114</b> before and after the switch is actuated by the player, as described above, and returns switch <b>114</b> to its original state after a preset period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once the microprocessor <b>124</b> receives the output data <b>126</b> from joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b</i>and the desired mode of operation, the microprocessor <b>124</b> communicates this data to the game console <b>120</b>. Specifically, when the player selects the normal mode of operation, the player either leaves switch <b>114</b> in the normal/default position or physically moves the switch from the invert position to the normal/default position. The microprocessor <b>120</b> communicates the output data or value <b>126</b> from the joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>106</b><i>b </i>to game console <b>120</b>, as is known in the art. When the player selects the opposite mode or the invert mode of operation by either moving switch <b>114</b> to the invert position or leaving switch <b>114</b> in the invert position, microprocessor <b>124</b> communicates the inverted data or value to game console <b>120</b> by one of two methods.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A first method of inverting the joystick data or value employs a potentiometer. A potentiometer has three connections: a plus connection, a “wiper” connection, and a ground connection where the plus and wiper connections have either a “plus” or a “minus” resistance. In the normal mode of operation, for example, as the wiper connection moves away from the ground connection, the resistance increases which thereby increases the control value or joystick value at the analog to digital converter <b>128</b>. Accordingly, to produce an inverted value, the plus and ground connections are physically swapped.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A second method of inverting the joystick data or value employs a mathematical method using the maximum value that can be produced by the circuit. The maximum value is electrically determined based on the components and software of the game controller <b>100</b>. An inverted or invert value is determined by subtracting a read value or actual value of the joystick output value from the known maximum value. For example, if the maximum value is sixty-four and the output value received from the joysticks <b>106</b><i>a </i>or <b>106</b><i>b </i>(through the analog to digital converter <b>128</b>) is forty, the inverted value is twenty-four (i.e., (64−40)=24).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once the inverted values are determined by either of the above two methods, the microprocessor <b>124</b> communicates the inverted values to the game console <b>120</b> and software <b>121</b> which directs the indicator or indicators of the video game to respond accordingly. Since the game software receives the inverted values, the software directs the game as if the player were operating the controls or joysticks in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, the present invention enables a player to invert the operation of one or more control devices on a game controller instead of using complicated setup procedures employed by the game software. In particular, the present invention enables a player to easily switch the mode of operation for the control device by actuating, changing or moving switch <b>114</b> located on the game controller <b>100</b> to a desired operational mode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another embodiment, at least one indicator such as first and second indicators <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b</i>, respectively, are associated with each of the different modes of operation to identify the mode of operation. For example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the first indicator <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the second indicator <b>112</b><i>b </i>each include text or a phrase such as “DEFAULT” and “INVERTED” which identify the different modes associated with switch <b>114</b>. It should be appreciated that the indicators may be text, audio, audio-visual, symbols or any suitable indicator that identifies the modes of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an alternative embodiment, the game controller includes a plurality of control devices such as a plurality of joysticks. Each of the joysticks is controlled by a single switch mechanism. In this embodiment, a player uses the switch mechanism to change the mode of operation to the same mode of operation for all of the control devices. In another embodiment, the game controller includes a plurality of switch mechanisms where each switch mechanism is associated with a different control device. In this embodiment, the player uses each switch mechanism to change the operational mode for one or more of the control devices. It should be appreciated that any suitable number of control devices and switch mechanisms may be included on the game controller to control the operations of one or more of the control devices.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment the control device of the game controller is a touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p>
