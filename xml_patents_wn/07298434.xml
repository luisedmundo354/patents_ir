<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a liquid crystal display device and more particularly, to a liquid crystal display device capable of having a uniform viewing angle while reducing the cost of production.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid crystal display (hereinafter, LCD) devices have trended to have increasingly wider application scope due to lightness, thinness, and low power consumption of these devices. Accordingly, LCD devices find use in office automation devices, audio/video devices and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An LCD device adjusts the transmittance of a light beam in accordance with an image signal applied to multiple control switches arranged as a matrix in order to display desired pictures in a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since an LCD is not a self-luminescent device, the LCD requires a light source such as a back light unit. There are two types of back light units, i.e., a direct-below-type and an edge-type. The direct-below-type diffuses light generated from multiple lamps arranged in parallel at a rear surface of a diffusion plate by using the diffusion plate to irradiate the light. The edge-type irradiates light irradiated from a lamp through an incident surface provided at a side surface of a transparent light guide plate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a related art liquid crystal display adopting an edge-type back light unit that includes a main support <b>22</b>, a backlight unit and a liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> stacked inside of the main support <b>22</b>. A top case <b>2</b> encloses the edge of the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> and the side surface of the main support <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> includes an upper substrate <b>3</b> and a lower substrate <b>5</b>. Liquid crystal materials are injected between the upper substrate <b>3</b> and the lower substrate <b>5</b>. The liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> is provided with a spacer (not shown) to constantly keep a gap between the upper substrate <b>3</b> and the lower substrate <b>5</b>. The upper substrate <b>3</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> is provided with a color filter, a common electrode and a black matrix (not shown). Signal lines such as a data line and a gate line (not shown) are formed on the lower substrate <b>5</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>. A thin film transistor (TFT) is formed at an intersection between the data line and the gate line. The TFT switches a data signal to be transmitted from the data line to the liquid crystal cell in response to a scanning signal (i.e., a gate pulse) from the gate line. A pixel electrode is formed at a pixel area between the data line and the gate line. One side of the lower substrate <b>5</b> is provided with a pad area connected to each of the data line and the gate line. A tape carrier package (not shown), having a driver integrated circuit mounted thereon for applying a driving signal to the TFT, is attached onto the pad area. This tape carrier package applies a data signal from the driver integrated circuit to the data line. The tape carrier package also supplies the scanning signal to the gate line.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An upper polarizing sheet is attached onto the upper substrate <b>3</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>, and a lower polarizing sheet is attached onto the rear side of the lower substrate <b>5</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The main support <b>22</b> is made of a molded material, and its inner wall is molded into a stepped coverage face. A securing part, in which the back light unit and the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> are disposed, is formed on the stepped coverage face. The back light unit and the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> are sequentially stacked on the stepped coverage face of the main support <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The back light unit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, includes a lamp <b>26</b> irradiating light onto the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>, and a lamp housing <b>28</b> enclosing the lamp <b>26</b>. A light guide plate <b>18</b> directs light incident from the lamp <b>26</b> toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>. A reflection sheet <b>20</b> is arranged on a rear surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b>. Optical sheets <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are stacked over the light guide plate <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A cold cathode fluorescent lamp is mainly used as the lamp <b>26</b>. The light generated from the lamp <b>26</b> is incident to the light guide plate <b>18</b> through a surface provided at one side of the light guide plate <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The lamp housing <b>28</b> includes a reflective surface in its inside, and the lamp housing <b>28</b> is installed to enclose the lamp <b>26</b>, to thereby reflect the light generated from the lamp <b>26</b> toward the incident surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The reflection sheet <b>20</b> is located at the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b>. The reflection sheet <b>20</b> serves to re-reflect light incident thereto, through the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b>, onto the light guide plate <b>18</b>, thereby reducing the light loss. In other words, a portion of the light emitted from the lamp <b>26</b> progresses toward the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b>, and this light is then reflected from the reflection sheet <b>20</b> to progress toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The light guide plate <b>18</b> converts linear light provided by the lamp <b>26</b> into surface light, and the light guide plate <b>18</b> guides the light into the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>. To this end, an inclined surface having a designated slant is formed on the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b>. Formed on the inclined surface are multiple printed patterns <b>52</b> spaced apart from each other by a designated distance. Accordingly, the light guide plate <b>18</b> makes light uniformly progress by being provided with a light receiving part toward an outgoing surface facing the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>. Also, the light progressing toward the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b> reflects from the reflection sheet <b>20</b>, to thereby progress toward the outgoing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The efficiency of the light incident to the liquid crystal panel <b>6</b> maximizes when the incident light is perpendicular to the liquid crystal panel <b>6</b>. Accordingly, the optical sheets <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> convert the light outputted from the light guide plate <b>18</b> to be perpendicular to the liquid crystal panel <b>6</b>, to thereby improve the efficiency of the light. To this end, a lower diffusing sheet <b>10</b> diffuses the light from the light guide plate <b>18</b> into an entire area, first and second prism sheets <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> change a progressing angle of the light diffused by the lower diffusing sheet to be perpendicular to the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>, and an upper diffusing sheet <b>16</b> diffuses the light going through the first and second prism sheets <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the light provided from the light guide plate <b>18</b> is incident, via the optical sheets <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, to the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Meanwhile, the related art liquid crystal display device supports the lamp housing <b>28</b> enclosing the lamp <b>26</b>, and the device further includes a bottom cover <b>24</b> for radiating light generated from the lamp housing <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The bottom cover <b>24</b> includes a plane part and a side part perpendicularly bent with respect to each other in order to enclose a rear surface and a side surface at one side of the main support <b>22</b>. A screw hole through which a screw (not shown) penetrates is formed at the side of the bottom cover <b>24</b>. The bottom cover <b>24</b> is joined by the screw and is fixed in the main support <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The top case <b>2</b> is manufactured into a square band shape having a plane part and a side part perpendicularly bent with respect to each other. The top case <b>2</b> encloses the edge of the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> and the main support <b>22</b>. The top case <b>2</b> is joined to the main support <b>22</b> by the screw (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As set forth above, the related art liquid crystal display device has the light incident from the lamp <b>26</b> to the light guide plate <b>18</b> progressing toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>6</b> through the use of the printed pattern <b>52</b>. The related art liquid crystal display device tries to achieve a uniform distribution of light by using the printed pattern <b>52</b> formed on an inclined surface of the liquid guide plate <b>18</b>. However, a disadvantage arises in that the viewing angle of light provided from the light guide plate <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cannot be uniform over the full angle. Further, the related art liquid crystal display device requires the upper and lower diffusing sheets <b>10</b> and <b>16</b>, and the first and the second prism sheets <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in order to adjust the direction of the light outputted through the light guide plate <b>18</b> and secure an uniform viewing angle at the full angular displacement. Accordingly, since the first and the second prism sheets <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are necessarily employed in the related art liquid crystal display device, the production cost becomes high.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, since the light outputted from the light guide plate <b>18</b> irradiates via the first and the second prism sheets <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to the liquid crystal display panel, a light loss occurs. As a result, the brightness lowers. Thus, the display quality of the liquid crystal display device is deteriorates from the lowered brightness.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a liquid crystal display device capable of having a uniform viewing angle and reducing the cost of a production.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention, in part, pertains to a liquid crystal display device that includes a liquid crystal display panel, a lamp irradiating light to the liquid crystal display panel, a light guide plate converting the light from the lamp into a surface light to irradiate to the liquid crystal display panel, and multiple patterns, each of the patterns being formed in the light guide plate and having a first curvature of a first sectional surface and a second curvature of a second sectional surface which are different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the invention, each of the patterns can include a pillar having a first lateral wall element and a second lateral wall element which have different heights from each other in the first sectional surface direction, a third lateral wall element and a fourth lateral wall element which have same heights with each other in the second sectional surface direction, a first curved surface formed between the first and the second lateral walls, and a second curved surface formed between the third and the fourth lateral walls.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the invention, any one of the first and the second lateral walls faces the lamp. The patterns can be substantially arranged in a matrix type configuration. Distances between the patterns can become gradually narrow as the patterns are farther from the lamp. The patterns can be gathered in a designated number to form each of pattern groups. The number of the patterns grouped in each of the pattern groups can gradually increase as the pattern groups are farther from the lamp. The patterns can be grouped in a shape of an ellipse in each of the pattern groups. The lamp can be arranged to face to one side surface of the light guide plate.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a liquid crystal display according to a first embodiment of the invention. The inventive display includes a main support <b>122</b>, a back light unit and a liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> stacked within the main support <b>122</b>. The back light unit includes a light guide plate <b>118</b> provided with multiple minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> in which a first curvature of a first sectional surface and a second curvature of a second sectional surface are different from each other. A top case <b>102</b> encloses the edge of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> and the side surface of the main support <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> includes an upper substrate <b>103</b> and a lower substrate <b>105</b>. Liquid crystal materials are injected between the upper substrate <b>103</b> and the lower substrate <b>105</b>. The liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> is provided with a spacer (not shown) to constantly keep a gap between the upper substrate <b>103</b> and the lower substrate <b>105</b>. The upper substrate <b>103</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> is provided with a color filter, a common electrode and a black matrix (not shown). Signal lines such as a data lines and a gate line (not shown) are formed at the lower substrate <b>105</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. A thin film transistor (TFT) is formed at a crossing of the data line and the gate line. The TFT switches the data signal to be transmitted from the data line to the liquid crystal cell in response to a scanning signal (i.e., a gate pulse) from the gate line. A pixel electrode is formed at a pixel area between the data line and the gate line. One side of the lower substrate <b>105</b> is provided with a pad area connected to each of the data line and the gate line. A tape carrier package (not shown), having a driver integrated circuit mounted thereon for applying a driving signal to the TFT, is attached to the pad area. This tape carrier package applies a data signal from the driver integrated circuit to the data line. Also, the tape carrier package supplies the scanning signal to the gate line.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An upper polarizing sheet is attached to the upper substrate <b>103</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>, and a lower polarizing sheet is attached onto of the rear side of the lower substrate <b>105</b> of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The main support <b>122</b> is made of a molded material such as a thermoplastic resin, and its inner wall is molded into a stepped coverage face. A securing part (which can be notches) in which the back light unit and the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> are disposed is formed on the stepped coverage face. The back light unit and the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> are sequentially stacked over the stepped coverage face of the main support <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the back light unit according to the first embodiment of the invention. This back light unit includes a lamp <b>126</b> irradiating light onto the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. A lamp housing <b>128</b> encloses the lamp <b>126</b>, and a light guide plate <b>118</b> directs light incident from the lamp <b>126</b> toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> through the use of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b>. A reflection sheet <b>120</b> is arranged over a rear surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b>, and a diffusion sheet <b>110</b> stacks on the light guide plate <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A cold cathode fluorescent lamp is mainly used for the lamp <b>126</b>. However, the invention is not restricted to a cold cathode fluorescent lamp, and any appropriate lamp can be used. The light generated from the lamp <b>126</b> is incident to the light guide plate <b>118</b> through an incident surface provided at one side of the light guide plate <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The lamp housing <b>128</b> includes a reflection surface on its interior, and the lamp housing <b>128</b> is installed to enclose the lamp <b>126</b>, to thereby reflect the light generated by the lamp <b>126</b> toward the incident surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The reflection sheet <b>120</b> is located at the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b>. The reflection sheet <b>120</b> serves to re-reflect light incident thereto, through the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b> into the light guide plate <b>118</b>, thereby reducing a light loss. In other words, the light progressing toward the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b> (from among the total light outputted from the lamp <b>126</b>) reflects from the reflection sheet <b>120</b> to proceed toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The diffusion sheet <b>110</b> diffuses the light from the light guide plate <b>118</b> to irradiate the liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The light guide plate <b>118</b> converts linear light incident from the lamp <b>126</b> to a surface light to thereby guide the light to the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. To this end, an inclined surface having a designated inclination is formed on the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>18</b>. Formed over the inclination surface are multiple minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> arranged in a matrix, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As the light entering the light guide plate <b>118</b> from the lamp <b>126</b> goes toward an end of the light guide plate <b>118</b>, the intensity of light decreases. Accordingly, uniformly outputting the light from the light guide plate <b>118</b> is achieved by correspondingly increasing the intensity of the light at the end of the light guide plate <b>118</b>. To achieve this, each distance between the minute lens type, i.e., lens shaped, intaglio patterns <b>130</b> is set differently from each other. That is, the density of the intaglio patterns <b>130</b> increases with increasing distance from the lamp <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that as the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> go from the minute lens type intaglio pattern <b>130</b> near the lamp <b>126</b> to the minute lens type intaglio pattern <b>130</b> near a side surface opposite to the incident surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b>, each distance (L<b>1</b> to L<b>7</b>) between the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> gradually decreases. In other words, as the intaglio patterns <b>130</b> go from the light incident side of the light guide plate <b>118</b> to the end side of the light guide plate <b>118</b>, intaglio patterns <b>130</b> become densely arranged. Accordingly, as the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> approach the lamp <b>126</b>, the intaglio patterns <b>130</b> are arranged having a low density. On the other hand, as the intaglio patterns <b>130</b> become farther away from the lamp <b>126</b>, the intaglio patterns <b>130</b> are arranged having a high density. Therefore, the intensity of light at the side surface opposite to the incident surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b> becomes highly improved by virtue of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> arranged in the high density. As a result, the display has uniform lighting.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that each of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> has a shape of a circular column whose upper surface is rounded on a slant. Each intaglio pattern <b>130</b> includes a pillar <b>131</b> having a first rounded lateral wall element <b>132</b> and a second rounded lateral wall element <b>134</b> which have a different height from each other in the first sectional direction. A third lateral wall element <b>133</b> and a fourth lateral wall element <b>135</b> have the same height in the second sectional direction. A first curved surface <b>136</b> is formed between the first and the second rounded lateral wall elements <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, and a second curved surface <b>138</b> is formed between the third and the fourth lateral wall elements <b>133</b> and <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The second lateral wall <b>134</b> (of the first and the second rounded lateral walls <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>) faces to the lamp <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first curved surface <b>136</b> and the second curved surface <b>138</b> have a curvature R<b>1</b> and a curvature R<b>2</b>, respectively, that are different from each other. The first curved surface <b>136</b> has the first curvature R<b>1</b> of a first sectional surface, and the second curved surface <b>138</b> has the second curvature R<b>2</b> of a second sectional surface crossing the first sectional surface.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that the first curved surface <b>136</b> gathers light <b>140</b> from the lamp <b>126</b> in up and down directions to direct the light <b>140</b> toward the light emitting surface. To this end, the first curvature R<b>1</b> of the first curved surface <b>136</b> is set in order to direct the light <b>140</b> from the lamp <b>126</b> in up and down, i.e., vertical, directions.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Also, the second curved surface <b>138</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, gathers light <b>140</b> emitted from the lamp <b>126</b> in left and right directions and directs the light <b>140</b> toward the light outgoing surface. To this end, the second curvature R<b>2</b> of the second curved surface <b>138</b> is set to gather the light <b>140</b> emitted from the lamp <b>126</b> in left and right, i.e., oblique, directions.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The inventive minute lens type intaglio pattern <b>130</b> is manufactured using a lithographic galvanoforming (LIGA) method or an ejection (etching) method. If the minute lens type intaglio pattern <b>130</b> is formed by the ejection method, then the intaglio pattern is formed in the core of an injection molding by way of an etch. However, the inventive intaglio pattern can be formed by any appropriate process, and the invention is not restricted to LIGA and ejection.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The minute lens type intaglio pattern <b>130</b> gathers the light <b>140</b> entering the light guide plate <b>118</b> from the lamp <b>126</b> in up and down directions, and in left and right directions. Accordingly, the light guide plate <b>118</b> has a distribution characteristic of the viewing angle caused by the minute lens type intaglio pattern <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the viewing angle of the light provided from the light guide plate <b>118</b> of the invention is uniform at a full angle, and it can be known that the distribution characteristic of the viewing angle of the light provided from the light guide plate of the invention improves as compared with the distribution characteristic of the viewing angle of the light provided from the related art light guide plate. Thus, the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the invention can eliminate two prism sheets used in the related art back light unit by virtue of the light guide plate <b>118</b> provided with the above-described minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The light guide plate <b>118</b> functions to uniformly direct the light provided via the light input part, by using the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b>, to a light-emitting surface facing the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. Also, the light progressing toward the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>118</b> reflects from the reflection sheet <b>120</b>, to thereby direct light toward the light outgoing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The liquid crystal display device supports the lamp housing <b>128</b> enclosing the lamp <b>126</b> by using a bottom cover <b>124</b>. The bottom cover <b>124</b> includes a plane part and a side part perpendicularly bent with respect to each other in order to enclose a rear surface and a side surface in one side of the main support <b>122</b>. A screw hole through which a screw (not shown) penetrates is formed at the side of the bottom cover <b>124</b>. The bottom cover <b>124</b> is joined by the screw and is fixed in the main support <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The top case <b>102</b> is manufactured into a square band shape having a plane part and a side part perpendicularly bent with respect to each other. The top case <b>102</b> encloses the edge of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> and the main support <b>122</b>. The top case <b>102</b> is joined to the main support <b>122</b> by a screw (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As set forth above, the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the invention perpendicularly redirects the light <b>140</b> incident to the light guide plate <b>118</b>, via the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> formed on the light guide plate <b>118</b>. The invention also uniformly distributes the viewing angle of the light outputted from the light guide plate <b>118</b> in a large angular range to irradiate the light to the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the invention can eliminate the related art prism sheets and can irradiate uniform light, through the use of only one diffusion sheet <b>110</b>, to the entire surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. Thus, it becomes possible to improve the display quality of a liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a liquid crystal display device according to a second embodiment of the invention. This embodiment has configuration elements identical to those of the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> except for a light guide plate <b>218</b>. Therefore, an explanation on the liquid crystal display device according to the second embodiment of the invention except will be omitted except for the light guide plate <b>218</b>. Also, the configuration elements in the second embodiment will be assigned the same reference numerals as those in the first embodiment of the inventive liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the light guide plate <b>218</b> of the second embodiment of the invention, multiple intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b> having an elliptical shape are formed in a matrix configuration, where each of the intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b> has a designated number of minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>230</b>. Here, the distance between the intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b> is about the same.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the intaglio pattern group <b>232</b> that is closer to a lamp <b>226</b>, the intaglio pattern group <b>232</b> has a lower number of minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>230</b>. Also, as the intaglio pattern group <b>232</b> becomes closer to the lamp <b>226</b>, the intaglio pattern group <b>232</b> has a smaller area. Accordingly, the light intensity at the surface opposite to a light incident surface of the light guide plate <b>218</b> becomes highly improved by virtue of the intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b> with their gradually increased areas.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Each of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>230</b> (which appear in different numbers in the different intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b>) has the shape depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. That is, each intaglio pattern has a shape of a circular column whose upper surface is rounded on a slant. The minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>130</b> includes a pillar <b>131</b> having a first rounded lateral wall element <b>132</b> and a second rounded lateral wall element <b>134</b>, which have a different height from each other in the first sectional direction. A third lateral wall element <b>133</b> and a fourth lateral wall element <b>135</b> have the same height as each other in the second sectional direction. A first curved surface <b>136</b> formed between the first and the second rounded lateral wall elements <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, and a second curved surface <b>138</b> formed between the third and the fourth lateral wall elements <b>133</b> and <b>135</b>. Since each of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>230</b> is identical to that of the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the invention, a further detailed explanation will be omitted for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b>, in which the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>230</b> are grouped, gather light entering the light guide plate <b>218</b> from the lamp <b>226</b>. As described above, the intaglio patterns gather light directed in up and down directions, and left and right directions. Thus, the liquid crystal display device according to the second embodiment of the invention can eliminate two prism sheets used in the related art back light unit by virtue of the minute intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b> having the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>230</b> grouped differently from each other in the configuration described above.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As a result, the liquid crystal display device according to the second embodiment of the invention raises uprightly, i.e., perpendicularly directs, the light inputted to the light guide plate <b>218</b>, via the minute intaglio pattern groups <b>232</b> having the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>230</b> formed by the number different each other. The invention uniformly distributes the viewing angle of the light outputted from the light guide plate <b>218</b> through the use of one diffusion sheet <b>110</b>, over a large angle range to irradiate the light to the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the liquid crystal display device according to the second embodiment of the invention can eliminate the prism sheets used in the related art and can uniformly irradiate an entire surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b> with uniform light through the use of only one diffusion sheet <b>110</b>. Thus, it becomes possible to improve a display quality of a liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a sectional view of a back light unit of the liquid crystal display device according to a third embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a the liquid crystal display device that has configuration elements identical to those of the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> except for a back light unit. Therefore, an explanation of the liquid crystal display device according to the third embodiment of the invention (except for the back light unit) will be omitted. Also, the configuration elements in the fourth embodiment are identical to those in the first embodiment and will be assigned the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The back light unit according to the third embodiment of the invention includes a lamp <b>326</b> irradiating light onto the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>, and a lamp housing <b>328</b> encloses the lamp <b>326</b>. A light guide plate <b>318</b> directs the light incident from the lamp <b>326</b> toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. A film <b>350</b> provided with multiple minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> reflects light incident to the light guide plate <b>318</b> at a designated angle. A reflection sheet <b>320</b> redirects the light proceeding toward a rear surface of the film <b>350</b> toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>. A diffusion sheet <b>310</b> diffuses the light provided from the light guide plate <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The reflection sheet <b>320</b> is located at the rear surface of the film <b>350</b>. The reflection sheet <b>320</b> serves to re-reflect light incident thereto, through the rear surface of the film <b>350</b>, to the light guide plate <b>318</b>, thereby reducing light loss. In other words, the light from the lamp <b>326</b>, that proceeds toward the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b> and the film <b>350</b>, reflects from the reflection sheet <b>320</b> to progress toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The light guide plate <b>318</b> changes the path of the light provided from the lamp <b>326</b> to be directed toward the liquid crystal display panel <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The film <b>350</b> converts the path of the light provided via a light incident surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b>, by using the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b>, in up and down directions and left and right directions, to thereby improve the viewing angle characteristic of the light guide plate <b>318</b>. Also, as the light emitted from the lamp <b>326</b> to the light guide plate <b>318</b> goes toward an end of the light guide plate <b>318</b>, the light intensity decreases. Accordingly, in order to make the light provided from the light guide plate <b>318</b> uniform, the invention correspondingly increases the intensity of the light at the end of the light guide plate <b>318</b>. To accomplish this, each distance between the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> formed on the film <b>350</b> is set differently from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows that as the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> go from one side of the film <b>350</b> near the lamp <b>326</b> to the other side opposite to one side of the film <b>350</b>, each distance (L<b>1</b> to L<b>7</b>) between the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> becomes gradually closer. In other words, as the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> go from one side of the film <b>350</b> to the other side, the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> are more densely arranged. Accordingly, as the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> approach the lamp <b>326</b>, the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> are arranged having a low density. On the other hand, as the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> become farther from the lamp <b>326</b>, the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> are arranged with a higher density. Therefore, the intensity of light at the far side becomes highly improved by virtue of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> arranged in a high density.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that each of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> has a shape of a circular column whose upper surface is rounded on a slant, which has been already described. Since the minute lens type intaglio pattern <b>330</b> is identical to that of the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the invention, a detailed explanation will be omitted for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows that each of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>430</b> formed on the film <b>450</b> is grouped in different numbers, and the intaglio patterns <b>430</b> are formed into intaglio pattern groups <b>432</b> having different areas from each other. Since the intaglio pattern groups <b>432</b> are identical to that of the liquid crystal display device according to the second embodiment of the invention, a detailed explanation will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The film <b>350</b> provided with the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> is attached on a transparent ultraviolet ray hardened resin layer <b>334</b> applied to an inclined rear surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A preferred method of attaching the film <b>350</b> having the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> to the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b> as performed as follows. First, a transparent ultraviolet light hardenable resin layer <b>334</b> is applied to the inclined rear surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b>. The ultraviolet light hardenable resin layer <b>334</b> can be typically formed from an acrylic or methacrylic polymer resin. Then, the film <b>350</b> having the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> is arranged and attached to the ultraviolet light hardenable resin layer <b>334</b> applied to the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b>. Subsequently, the ultraviolet light is irradiated to the film <b>350</b> attached to the ultraviolet light hardenable resin layer <b>334</b>, to thereby attach the film <b>350</b> to the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As set forth above, the liquid crystal display device according to the third embodiment of the invention directs the light inputted to the light guide plate <b>318</b> in an upright direction, through the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>330</b> formed on the film <b>352</b> attached to the rear surface of the light guide plate <b>318</b>. A uniform distribution the viewing angle of the light output from the light guide plate <b>318</b> is achieved over a large angle range to irradiate the liquid crystal display panel. Accordingly, the liquid crystal display device of the third embodiment of the invention can eliminate the prism sheets used in the related art and can uniformly irradiate light by using only one diffusion sheet <b>110</b> to an entire surface of the liquid crystal display panel. Thus, it is possible to improve the luminance and display quality of a liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Also, in the liquid crystal display devices according to the fist to the third embodiments of the invention, the lamps <b>126</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>326</b> irradiate the light to the light guide plates <b>118</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>318</b>, respectively. Alternately, the lamp can be bent in a shape of letter L, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The lamp <b>426</b> with the L shape is installed to face to one side surface and an upper side surface of the light guide plate <b>418</b> or to face to one side surface and a lower side surface of the light guide plate <b>418</b>. This lamp configuration can remedy a dark phenomenon in an edge of the light guide plate <b>418</b> through the use of the lamp <b>426</b> with the L shape. Further, the liquid crystal display device can improve the viewing angle characteristic of the light guide plate <b>418</b> by converting the path of light provided via an incident surface of the light guide plate <b>418</b> to up and down directions and left and right directions through the use of the minute lens type intaglio patterns <b>333</b>. Here, the density of the intaglio pattern increases with increasing distance from the lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The liquid crystal display devices according to the embodiments of the invention described above can be employed in a small-sized liquid crystal displays using multiple light-emitting diodes as a light source, such as personal digital assistants (PDA) or mobile phones. Accordingly, the liquid crystal display device according to the invention raises color purities of lights generated form the light-emitting diodes by using the light guide plate having the minute lens type intaglio patterns as described above, so that the technology can be applied to small-sized liquid crystal display devices having a back light unit without having two prism sheets. The cost of producing the device is accordingly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, the liquid crystal display device according to the invention includes a light guide plate provided with the minute lens type intaglio patterns or the intaglio pattern groups. Accordingly, the invention uprightly redirects the light input to the light guide plate by using the minute lens type intaglio patterns or the minute intaglio pattern groups. The invention uniformly distributes the viewing angle of the light output from the light guide plate by using one diffusion sheet in irradiate the light to the liquid crystal display panel over a large angular range. Accordingly, the invention can eliminate the prism sheets to thereby decrease the thickness of the liquid crystal display device. Further, the invention uniformly irradiates the light, while using only one diffusion sheet, to an entire surface of the liquid crystal display panel. It is thus possible to improve the display quality of a liquid crystal display device.</p>
