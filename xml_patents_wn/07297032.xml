<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a combined connector, and more particularly to a combined connector including a plurality of stacked housings each having terminal receiving chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, a joint connector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> has been proposed as a combined connector of the type described above (see, for example, JP-A-6-181078). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an exploded, perspective view of the related joint connector, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view of the joint connector taken along the line I-I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in these Figures, the joint connector comprises three male connectors (housings) <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> stacked together. Terminal receiving chambers are formed in each of the male connectors <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>, and female terminals <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> each fixedly secured to an end portion of a wire <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> are inserted and fitted respectively in the terminal receiving chambers of each male connector. The female terminals <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> are retained within the respective terminal receiving chambers by terminal retaining lances <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b> for withdrawal prevention purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pair of retaining projections <b>93</b> and a pair of projection insertion holes <b>103</b> for connection to the male connector <b>52</b> are provided at a side wall of the male connector <b>53</b> facing the male connector <b>52</b>, the retaining projections <b>93</b> being disposed adjacent to the projection insertion holes <b>103</b>. On the other hand, retaining projection <b>92</b><i>a </i>are formed on a side wall of the male connector <b>52</b> facing the male connector <b>53</b>, and are so arranged as to be opposed respectively to the projection insertion holes <b>103</b> in the male connector <b>53</b>. Also, projection insertion holes <b>102</b> are formed in this side wall of the male connector <b>52</b>, and are disposed adjacent to the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, and are so arranged as to be opposed respectively to the retaining projections <b>93</b> of the male connector <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A pair of retaining projections <b>92</b><i>b </i>for connection to the male connector <b>51</b> are formed on a side wall of the male connector <b>52</b> facing the male connector <b>51</b>, and are disposed adjacent to each other. Projection insertion holes <b>101</b> are formed in a side wall of the male connector <b>51</b> facing the male connector <b>52</b>, and are so arranged as to be opposed respectively to the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>b </i>of the male connector <b>52</b>. Constricted portions of the female terminals <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> are disposed in registry with the projection insertion holes <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, respectively, and the female terminals <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> are retained respectively by the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>b</i>, <b>93</b> and <b>92</b><i>a </i>in a double manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the above joint connector, the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>b </i>and <b>93</b> project upward (in the drawings) in a stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, while the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>a </i>project downward (in the drawings) in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>. Therefore, the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b </i>and <b>93</b> can be arranged on a common plane in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>. In other words, the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>b </i>and <b>93</b> are offset with respect to the retaining projections <b>92</b><i>b </i>in a longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b> of the female terminals <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, when the constricted portions of the female terminals <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> are disposed in registry with the projection insertion holes <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> into which the respective retaining projections <b>92</b><i>b</i>, <b>93</b> and <b>92</b><i>a </i>are inserted, the distal ends of the female terminals <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> are offset with respect to the distal ends of the female terminals <b>73</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the distal ends of the female terminals <b>73</b> are disposed rearwardly of the distal ends of the female terminals <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>. Therefore, mating male terminals to be fitted respectively into the female terminals <b>73</b> need to be made longer than mating male terminals to be fitted respectively into the female terminals <b>71</b> and <b>72</b>. Namely, it has been necessary to prepare the male terminals for exclusive use for connection to the female terminals <b>73</b>, and this is undesirable from the viewpoint of the cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">JP-A-2004-335305 discloses a joint connector in which mating male terminals for fitting respectively into female terminals in male connectors have the same length. In this joint connector, however, the female terminals in an uppermost one of the stacked male connectors are not retained in a double manner, and it is feared that the female terminals in the uppermost male connector are withdrawn therefrom.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the above problems in view, it is an object of this invention to provide a combined connector in which common mating terminals can be used for connection to all of housings, and besides all of terminals received in the housings can be retained in a double manner, thereby reducing the cost and also enhancing the reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above problem has been solved by a combined connector of the invention, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a first housing that has a first terminal receiving chamber for receiving a first terminal; and</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">a second housing that is stacked on the first housing and has a second terminal receiving chamber for receiving a second terminal;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein the first housing includes:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a retaining projection which projects and inserts into the second terminal receiving chamber to retain the second terminal in the second terminal receiving chamber; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">a terminal retaining portion which retains the first terminal received in the first terminal receiving chamber and is disposed so as to contact with the second housing in a state that the first housing and the second housing are stacked together.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">In the above configuration, the terminal retaining portion, formed at the first housing abuts against the second housing, and therefore is prevented from elastically deformed toward the second housing, thereby effecting secondary retaining of the first terminal received in the first housing. On the other hand, the second terminal, received in the second housing, is retained in a secondary manner by the retaining projection formed at the first housing. Therefore, the terminal retaining portion, formed at the first housing, abuts against the second housing to thereby effect the secondary retaining, and by doing so, the first terminal received in the first housing can be retained in a double manner without directly retaining this terminal. Therefore, even when the two terminals, received respectively in the first and second terminal receiving chambers of the first and second housings, are disposed in the respective positions coinciding with each other with respect to the longitudinal direction, both of the two terminals can be retained in a double manner.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">Preferably, the first housing and the second housing respectively include engagement portions that are provided on regions vicinity of the retaining projection and the terminal retaining portion. The engagement portions are retainingly engaged with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">Preferably, the engagement portions are respectively provided on a partition wall of the first terminal receiving chamber and a part of the second housing corresponding to the petition wall of the first terminal receiving chamber in the state that the first housing and the second housing are stacked together.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">Preferably, the second housing includes a protrusion which is disposed so as to be pressed in contact with the terminal retaining portion of the first housing in a state that the first housing and the second housing are stacked together.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">In the above configuration, the first housing and the second housing include the respective retaining portions which are retainingly engaged with each other when the retaining projection retains the terminal received in the terminal receiving chamber in the second housing, and the terminal retaining portion abuts against the second housing. With this construction, when the first terminal, received in the first housing, is in a half-inserted condition, that is, when the first terminal is not retained by the terminal retaining portion, the terminal retaining portion is elastically deformed toward the second housing, and the terminal retaining portion and the second housing fail to properly abut against each other, so that the first housing can not be locked to the second housing by the retaining portions. On the other hand, when the terminal, received in the second housing, is in a half-inserted condition, that is, when the terminal is not retained by the retaining projection, the retaining projection can not be inserted into the proper retaining position, and therefore the one and other housings can not be locked to each other by the retaining portions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">As described above, in the invention of claim <b>1</b>, the terminal retaining portion, formed at the first housing, abuts against the second housing to thereby effect the secondary retaining, and by doing so, the terminal received in the first housing can be retained in a double manner without directly retaining this terminal. Therefore, even when the two terminals, received respectively in the terminal receiving chambers of the one and other housings, are disposed in the respective positions coinciding with each other with respect to the longitudinal direction, both of the two terminals can be retained in a double manner. Therefore, common mating terminals can be used for connection to both of the one and other housings, so that the cost can be reduced. And besides, both of the terminals, received respectively in the terminal receiving chambers of the one and other housings, can be retained in a double manner, thereby enhancing the reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">In the invention of claim <b>2</b>, when the terminal, received in the first housing, is in a half-inserted condition, that is, when the terminal is not retained by the terminal retaining portion, the terminal retaining portion is elastically deformed toward the second housing, and the terminal retaining portion and the second housing fail to properly abut against each other, so that the first housing can not be locked to the second housing by the retaining portions. On the other hand, when the terminal, received in the second housing, is in a half-inserted condition, that is, when the terminal is not retained by the retaining projection, the retaining projection can not be inserted into the proper retaining position, and therefore the one and other housings can not be locked to each other by the retaining portions, and therefore such half-inserted condition of each terminal can be detected.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0037">First, the construction of the upper housing <b>10</b> will be described. The upper housing <b>10</b> has a generally box-shape, and mainly includes a lower wall <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) defining a lower housing (<b>20</b>) side-surface of the terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b> in a stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, an upper wall <b>12</b> defining an upper housing (<b>10</b>) side-surface of the terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, and a plurality of partition walls <b>13</b> separating the terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b> from one another in a juxtaposing direction Y<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0037" num="0038">First terminal retaining lances (terminal retaining portions) <b>11</b><i>a </i>of an elastic nature are formed on a front end portion of the lower wall <b>11</b> on which the front end portions (in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>) of the female terminals T<b>1</b> are disposed, and these lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>project away from the lower housing <b>20</b> as these lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>extend toward the front end of the upper housing.

The first terminal retaining lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>are provided respectively in the terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0039">The first terminal retaining lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>are so disposed that when the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are stacked together, second retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a </i>(described later) of the lower housing <b>20</b> abut respectively against these first terminal retaining lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Namely, the first terminal retaining lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>are formed on the lower wall <b>11</b> (on which the first retaining projections <b>11</b><i>b </i>are also formed) opposed to the lower housing <b>20</b> so that these first terminal retaining lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>can abut respectively against the second retaining projections (protrusion) <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, front end retaining grooves (retaining portions) <b>13</b><i>a </i>for retaining engagement with front end retaining projections (retaining portions) <b>22</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> (described later) of the lower housing <b>20</b> are formed in front end portions (in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>) of part of the plurality of partition walls <b>13</b>, and extend in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>. Among the plurality of partition walls <b>13</b>, the two outermost partition walls <b>13</b>, disposed respectively at the opposite sides (in the juxtaposing direction Y<b>2</b>) of the upper housing <b>10</b>, each has a rear end retaining projection (retaining portion) <b>13</b><i>b </i>(for retaining engagement with a rear end retaining groove (retaining portion) <b>23</b><i>b </i>(described later)) of the lower housing <b>20</b>) formed on a rear end portion (in the longitudinal direction Y) of an outer surface thereof. Also, guide projections <b>13</b><i>c </i>for guiding the upper housing <b>10</b> relative to the mating connector housing in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b> are formed on the outer surface of each of the two outermost partition walls <b>13</b>. Further, positioning projections <b>13</b><i>d </i>for positioning the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> relative to each other when stacking the two housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> together are formed respectively on lower housing (<b>20</b>)-side portions (in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>) of the two outermost partition walls <b>13</b> among the plurality of the partition walls <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">Next, the construction of the lower housing <b>20</b> will be described.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, mating terminal insertion ports <b>24</b> for the insertion of male terminals (not shown) for fitting in the respective female terminals T<b>2</b> are formed in a front end wall of the lower housing <b>20</b> disposed adjacent to the front sides of the female terminals T<b>2</b> in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>. Receiving terminal insertion ports <b>25</b> for inserting the female terminals T<b>2</b> into the respective terminal receiving chambers C<b>2</b> are formed in a rear end wall of the lower housing in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">Second terminal retaining lances <b>21</b><i>a </i>of an elastic nature are formed on a front end portion of the lower wall <b>21</b> on which the front end portions (in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>) of the female terminals T<b>2</b> are disposed, and these lances <b>21</b><i>a </i>project toward the upper housing <b>10</b> as these lances <b>21</b><i>a </i>extend toward the front end of the lower housing. The second terminal retaining lances <b>21</b><i>a </i>are provided respectively in the terminal receiving chambers C<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The second retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a </i>for abutting against the respective first terminal retaining lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>on the upper housing <b>10</b> are formed on the upper housing (<b>10</b>)-side surface (in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>) of the front end portion (in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>) of the upper wall <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and project toward the upper housing <b>10</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>. These second retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a </i>are provided respectively for the terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b>. Further, projection insertion holes <b>22</b><i>b </i>for the insertion of the first retaining projections <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the upper housing <b>10</b> thereinto are formed in the upper housing (<b>10</b>)-side surface (in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>) of the upper wall <b>22</b>, and are disposed adjacent respectively to rear ends (in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>) of the second retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, the front end retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> for retaining engagement with the front end retaining grooves <b>13</b><i>a </i>in the upper housing <b>10</b> are formed on front end portions (in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>) of part of the plurality of second retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and extend in the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>. Among the plurality of partition walls <b>23</b>, the two outermost partition walls <b>23</b>, disposed respectively at the opposite sides (in the juxtaposing direction Y<b>2</b>) of the lower housing <b>20</b>, each has the rear end retaining groove <b>23</b><i>b </i>(for retaining engagement with the rear end retaining projection <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the upper housing <b>10</b>) formed in a rear end portion (in the longitudinal direction Y) of an outer surface thereof. Further, positioning grooves <b>23</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) for positioning the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> relative to each other when stacking the two housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> together are formed respectively in upper housing (<b>10</b>)-side portions (in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>) of the two outermost partition walls <b>23</b> among the plurality of the partition walls <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are stacked together in a retained condition, the first terminal retaining lances <b>11</b><i>a </i>are disposed in registry with the second terminal retaining lances <b>21</b><i>a </i>in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>. In other words, the female terminals T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> of the same type are received in the respective positions coinciding with each other with respect to the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The female terminals T<b>1</b> and the female terminals T<b>2</b> have the same configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and each of the female terminals T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> includes a tubular portion P for receiving the male terminal, and a connection portion Co connected by pressing to the wire L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>. As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the height of the tubular portion P is larger than the height of the connection portion Co, and a step portion is formed at a rear end of the tubular portion P. A retaining hole H is formed in the tubular portion P, and part of the first/second terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>a </i>is inserted into this retaining hole H.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Next, a method of assembling the combined connector of the above construction will be described. First, before stacking the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> together, the female terminals T<b>1</b> are inserted respectively into the terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b>, while the female terminals T<b>2</b> are inserted respectively into the terminal receiving chambers C<b>2</b>. Each female terminal T<b>1</b> is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber C<b>1</b> through the receiving terminal insertion port <b>15</b> formed in the rear end of the upper housing <b>10</b>, and is advanced along the lower wall <b>11</b><i>a </i>toward the front end of the upper housing. When the tubular portion P of the female terminal T<b>1</b> advances to the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>is elastically deformed toward the lower housing <b>20</b> in the stacking direction Y.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">When the female terminal T<b>1</b> is further advanced, so that its retaining hole H reaches the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>is restored toward the upper housing <b>10</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, and is inserted into the retaining hole H. As a result, the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>effects primary retaining of the female terminal T<b>1</b>, and thus the female terminal T<b>1</b> is received and held in the terminal receiving chamber C<b>1</b>. In a similar manner described above for the female terminal T<b>1</b>, when each female terminal T<b>2</b> is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber C<b>2</b> through the receiving terminal insertion port <b>25</b>, the female terminal T<b>2</b> is retained by the second terminal retaining lance <b>21</b><i>a </i>in a primary manner, and is received and held in the terminal receiving chamber C<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Then, the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are combined together. First, the positioning projections <b>13</b><i>d </i>are mated respectively with the positioning grooves <b>23</b><i>c </i>in the lower housing <b>20</b>, and then the upper housing <b>10</b> is turned or pivotally moved about the positioning projections <b>13</b><i>d</i>. Namely, the rear end of the upper housing <b>10</b> is moved toward the lower housing <b>20</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, thereby inserting the first retaining projections <b>11</b><i>b </i>into the respective projection insertion holes <b>22</b><i>b</i>. When the first retaining projections <b>11</b><i>b </i>are further inserted into the respective projection insertion holes <b>22</b><i>b </i>toward the lower housing <b>20</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, the rear end retaining projections <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the upper housing <b>10</b> are inserted respectively into the rear end retaining grooves <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the lower housing <b>20</b>, and also the front end retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the lower housing <b>20</b> are inserted respectively into the front end retaining grooves <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>10</b>, so that the upper housing <b>10</b> and the lower housing <b>20</b> are locked or retained to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">When the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are thus locked together, each of the first retaining projections <b>11</b><i>b </i>inserted in the corresponding terminal receiving chamber C<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and is retainingly engaged with the step portion of the female terminal T<b>2</b> provided between the tubular portion P and the connection portion Co, thereby effecting secondary retaining of the female terminal T<b>2</b>. Also, each of the second retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a </i>abuts against the lower housing (<b>20</b>)-side surface of the corresponding first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>. As a result, the second retaining projection <b>22</b><i>a </i>prevents the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>from being elastically deformed toward the lower housing <b>20</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, thereby effecting the secondary retaining of the female terminal T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">In the above combined connector, the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second retaining projection <b>22</b><i>a </i>abut against each other, thereby effecting the secondary retaining, and therefore the double retaining can be effected without retaining the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>directly by the second retaining projection <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, even when the female terminals T<b>1</b> and the female terminals T<b>2</b> are disposed in the respective positions coinciding with each other with respect to the longitudinal direction Y<b>3</b>, the female terminals T<b>1</b> as well as the female terminals T<b>2</b> can be retained in a double manner. Therefore, common male terminals for fitting into the female terminals T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> can be used for connection to both of the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, so that the cost can be reduced. And besides, the female terminals T<b>1</b> received in the terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b> of the upper housing <b>10</b>, as well as the female terminals T<b>2</b> received in the terminal receiving chambers C<b>2</b> in the lower housing <b>20</b>, can be retained in a double manner, thereby enhancing the reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">Incidentally, when the female terminal T<b>1</b>, received in the terminal receiving chamber C<b>1</b> of the upper housing <b>10</b>, is in a half-inserted condition, that is, when the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>does not reach the retaining hole H of the female terminal T<b>1</b>, the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>is elastically deformed from a retaining position (indicated in a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) toward the lower housing <b>20</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">In this condition, the first terminal retaining lance <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second retaining projection <b>22</b><i>a </i>fail to properly abut against each other, so that the rear end retaining projections <b>13</b><i>b </i>can not be retainingly engaged in the respective rear end retaining grooves <b>23</b><i>b</i>. Also, the front end retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> can not be retainingly engaged in the respective front end retaining grooves <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, such a half-inserted condition of the female terminal T<b>1</b> can be detected at the time of stacking the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">On the other hand, when the female terminal T<b>2</b>, received in the terminal receiving chamber C<b>2</b> of the lower housing <b>20</b>, is in a half-inserted condition, that is, when the second terminal retaining lance <b>21</b><i>a </i>does not reach the retaining hole H of the female terminal T<b>2</b>, the first retaining projection <b>11</b><i>b </i>is displaced from a retaining position (indicated by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) toward the upper housing <b>10</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, and abuts against the tubular portion P of the female terminal T<b>2</b>. Therefore, the rear end retaining projections <b>13</b><i>b </i>can not be retainingly engaged in the respective rear end retaining grooves <b>23</b><i>b</i>. Also, the front end retaining projections <b>22</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> can not be retainingly engaged in the respective front end retaining grooves <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, such a half-inserted condition of the female terminal T<b>2</b> can also be detected at the time of stacking the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In the above embodiment, the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are stacked together in a two-stage manner. However, the invention is not limited to this construction, and for example an upper housing <b>10</b>, an intermediate housing <b>30</b> and a lower housing <b>20</b> can be stacked together in a three-stage manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Namely, the invention can be achieved in so far as the combined connector of the invention comprises at least one pair of housings. With respect to the three-stage structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the upper housing <b>10</b> corresponds to one housing of the adjacent housings <b>10</b> and <b>30</b>, while the intermediate housing <b>30</b> corresponds to the other housing. And, the intermediate housing <b>30</b> corresponds to one housing of the adjacent housings <b>30</b> and <b>20</b>, while the lower housing <b>20</b> corresponds to the other housing.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">In the above embodiment, each of the second terminal retaining lances <b>21</b><i>a</i>, formed at the lower housing <b>20</b>, projects toward the upper housing <b>10</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b> within the terminal receiving chamber C<b>2</b>. However, the direction of projecting of the second terminal retaining lance <b>21</b><i>a </i>is not limited to this direction, and for example each second terminal retaining lance can project in the juxtaposing direction Y<b>2</b> or away from the upper housing <b>10</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>. However, in the case where three or more housings are stacked together as is the case with the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the terminal retaining lances need to project toward the upper housing <b>10</b> in the stacking direction Y<b>1</b>, since the intermediate housing <b>30</b>, interposed between the upper and lower housings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, functions not only as the first housing but also as the other housing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">In the above embodiment, the female terminals T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are received in the respective terminal receiving chambers C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. However, the invention is not limited to this construction, and any other suitable terminals such for example of male terminals can be received.</p>
