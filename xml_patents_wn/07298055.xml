<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an auxiliary power supply and more particularly, to an auxiliary power supply for use with a wind turbine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Windmills have been in use throughout the world for generations harnessing the power of the wind. The windmill performs functions such as pumping water or grinding flour. A wind turbine is a windmill that converts the energy of the wind into a viable source of electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an existing wind turbine, the shaft of the turbine is connected to a generator located in the nacelle of the wind turbine. The generator is in turn connected to a high voltage transformer, typically located at the base of the tower of wind turbine. The high voltage transformer is connected to the generator by cables which are located in the tower. The high voltage transformer converts the electrical power from the generator into higher voltages. The output from the high voltage transformer is then connected directly into a utility's power grid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A source of 120/240V AC power at the nacelle of the wind turbine is beneficial because it gives the utility company the ability to provide lighting to assist maintenance personnel. Additionally, this 120/240V AC power source allows the utility company to change the pitch of the turbine blades even though the turbine is not generating electricity. One way to provide such an AC power source is to connect a separate low voltage transformer to the output of the generator. The low voltage transformer taps off the connection between the generator and the primary winding of the high voltage transformer. With this connection, the low voltage transformer provides 120/240V AC power when the generator is generating electricity and when the generator is not on line as long as the high voltage transformer remains connected to the power grid. By back feeding the low voltage transformer from the power grid, 120/240V AC power is available to assist the craftsperson during wind turbine maintenance periods.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another wind turbine design, the high voltage transformer is located in the nacelle and there is no low voltage transformer. A craftsperson would have to bring a portable generator in order to provide a 120/240V AC power when performing work at the tower. The generator would have to be located at the base of the tower in a well vented location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another wind turbine design, the generator and high voltage transformer are located in the nacelle of the turbine and a separate low voltage transformer is located at the bottom of the tower. In this design, low voltage wires are run from the connection between the generator and the primary side of the high voltage transformer to the low voltage transformer. High voltage wires in the tower connect the high voltage transformer to the power grid. Locating the high voltage transformer in the nacelle of the turbine creates some difficulties. Typically, the ability to take the high voltage transformer off line is performed by operating a switch at the high voltage transformer. When the transformer is in the nacelle of the wind turbine, this switching function must remain at or near the base of the tower to allow the utility company to easily disconnect the transformer from the power grid.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the high voltage transformer is energized, the high voltage wires in the tower of the wind turbine are also energized. These energized cables create a potential risk of electrocution to utility personnel who may be present in the tower of the wind turbine. As a result, when the utility company requires maintenance to be performed at the tower, the high voltage transformer is disconnected from the grid. By disconnecting the high voltage transformer from the grid, any low voltage transformer that is connected between the generator and the primary winding of the high voltage transformer is disabled. With the low voltage transformer disabled, there is no 120/240V AC power for the nacelle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is designed to overcome these limitations as well as provide a cost effective solution to isolate and protect the turbine's high voltage transformer when the high voltage transformer is connected into the utility company's power grid.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

The output of the generator <b>113</b> is connected to a high voltage dry type transformer <b>112</b> which is also housed in the nacelle <b>110</b>. Since the transformer <b>112</b> is located close to the generator <b>113</b>, the wiring and its associated potential hazards are reduced. The output from the dry type transformer <b>112</b> is connected to an enclosure <b>128</b> located at the base of the turbine <b>100</b> by high voltage wires <b>124</b> which are in the tower <b>134</b>. Power grid wires <b>122</b> connect the enclosure <b>128</b> to the utility power grid <b>126</b>. One example of such a high voltage dry type transformer <b>112</b> is a 1.8 MVA three-phase, 34500 GrdY/19920 transformer with an impedance of 5.75%, and a current rating of 30.12 Amps manufactured by Vestas Wind Systems A/S.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The enclosure <b>128</b> is typically mounted on a concrete pad and has an oil filled compartment <b>132</b> and a compartment <b>130</b> which is accessible by utility company maintenance personnel. These types of enclosures are generally designed to conform to industry standards and in this case, the enclosure <b>128</b> conforms to ANSI Standard C57.12.26. Within the accessible compartment <b>130</b>, all of the wiring to the tower <b>134</b> and power grid <b>126</b> is attached to the high voltage, power grid and low voltage dead front connectors <b>318</b>, <b>320</b> and <b>322</b>, respectively. The connectors <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The dead front connectors <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>322</b> provide the electrical connection between the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> and other components located in the oil filled compartment <b>132</b> and the outside environment. For example, from the low voltage dead front connectors <b>322</b>, the output of the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> is connected by low voltage wires <b>120</b> to the nacelle <b>110</b> of the wind turbine <b>100</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> is an oil immersed 112.5 kVA three phase transformer with 2% impedance manufactured by ABB Inc., assignee of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a circuit schematic for one embodiment of the power supply <b>200</b> housed in the oil filled compartment <b>132</b> of the enclosure <b>128</b>. This circuit is a three phase circuit but for ease of illustration only one phase is shown. The other two phases are identical. The power supply <b>200</b> includes the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> and the associated protection and switching elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> all of which are located in the oil filled compartment <b>132</b>. The oil in the oil filled compartment <b>132</b> not only provides the dielectric properties necessary to contain arcing associated with the switching elements <b>210</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> of the power supply <b>200</b>, but also provides cooling for the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b>. Either mineral oil or vegetable oil can be used in the oil filled compartment <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The high voltage wire <b>124</b> from the dry type transformer <b>112</b> in the nacelle <b>110</b> of the wind turbine <b>100</b> is connected to the high voltage dead front connector <b>320</b> at high voltage junction <b>230</b> located in the accessible compartment <b>130</b>. The high voltage junction <b>230</b> is electrically connected to the first current interrupting element <b>210</b> which is connected by the first fault protection element <b>212</b> to a junction <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first current interrupting element <b>210</b> provides electrical isolation for the electricity generated by wind turbine <b>100</b> from the rest of the power supply <b>200</b>. One device used for the first current interrupting element <b>210</b> is a LBOR (Load Break Oil Rotary) switch. In one embodiment for power supply <b>200</b>, a 300A, 150 BIL with a 38 kV rating LBOR switch manufactured by ABB Inc., the assignee of the present invention is used with the previously mentioned 1.8 kVA dry type transformer <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first fault protection element <b>212</b> provides low current fault protection for the dry type transformer <b>112</b>. One example of a first fault protection element <b>212</b> is a 50A, 23 kV dual sensing bay-o-net expulsion fuse manufactured by Cooper Industries. When this 50A expulsion fuse clears, gas is expulsed into the oil and the circuit opens. The 50A bay-o-net fuse also clears when the temperature of the oil reaches temperatures in excess of 120° C.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The junction <b>234</b> is connected to the power grid junction <b>232</b> by the series combination of the second fault protection element <b>214</b> and the second current interrupting element <b>216</b>. Power grid junction <b>232</b> is the electrical equivalent to the power grid dead front connectors <b>318</b> located in the accessible compartment <b>130</b> of the enclosure <b>128</b>. From the power grid junction <b>232</b>, the power grid wiring <b>122</b> connects to the power grid dead front connectors <b>318</b> and connects the power supply <b>200</b> to the power grid <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The second fault protection element <b>214</b> is selected to protect the dry type transformer <b>112</b> from high current faults. These high current faults are generally in the magnitude of several hundred amps to several thousand amps. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a “Shorty” 130A 23 kV PRCL (Partial Range Current Limiting) fuse manufactured by HiTech Industries is used for the second fault protection element <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second current interrupting element <b>216</b> provides the ability to isolate the power supply <b>200</b> from the power grid <b>126</b>. By using the second current interrupting element <b>216</b> to isolate the power supply <b>200</b> from the power grid <b>126</b>, the utility company can continue to provide 120/240V AC power to the turbine <b>100</b> while repairs or maintenance functions are performed on the power grid <b>126</b> or the power grid wiring <b>122</b>. In this embodiment, the operating characteristics of the second current interrupting element <b>216</b> are very similar to the first current interrupting element <b>210</b>. Since the requirements are approximately the same, the LBOR switch used for the first current interrupting element <b>210</b> is used for the second current interrupting element <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Junction <b>234</b> is connected to junction <b>236</b> by the series combination of a third current interrupting element <b>218</b> and a third fault protection element <b>220</b> to the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b>. The auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> converts the high voltage supplied from either the dry type transformer <b>112</b> or the power grid <b>126</b> into 120/240V AC. The output of the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> is connected to junction <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The third current interrupting element <b>218</b> electrically isolates the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> from both the power grid <b>126</b> and the high voltage transformer <b>112</b>. For safety reasons, the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> is disconnected from the power grid <b>126</b> and the high voltage transformer <b>112</b> when a fuse need to be replaced or other maintenance functions are performed. The amount of current flowing through the third current interrupting element <b>218</b> is less than the current flowing through first current interrupting element <b>210</b> or the second current interrupting element <b>216</b>. For this reason a smaller 200A, 125 BIL and a rating of 27 kV LBOR switch manufactured by ABB Inc., the assignee of the present invention is used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The third fault protection element <b>220</b> provides the low current fault protection for the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> as well as high temperature protection. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a 3A bay-o-net fuse may be used for the third fault protection element <b>220</b>. Alternatively should there be a space issue, a physically smaller fuse such as a 5A Dual Element fuse manufactured by Kearney Industries may also be used. The Kearney 5A Dual Element fuse has roughly the same operating characteristics as the 3A bay-o-net fuse. As the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> conducts higher amounts of current, the operating temperature of the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> and the temperature of the oil within the oil filled compartment <b>132</b> both rise. When the temperature of the oil reaches the temperature threshold of the third fault protection element <b>220</b>, approximately 120° C., the fuse clears and the circuit opens.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Junction <b>236</b> is the electrical equivalent to the low voltage dead front connectors <b>322</b> located in the accessible compartment <b>130</b> of the enclosure <b>128</b>. At the low voltage dead front connectors <b>322</b>, the low voltage wiring <b>120</b> is connected and routed back up the tower <b>134</b> and into the nacelle <b>110</b> of the turbine <b>100</b> to provide a source of 120/240V AC power.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As previously described, two different fault protection elements <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> are connected in series to protect the transformer <b>112</b>. The first fault protection element <b>212</b> protects the transformer <b>112</b> from low current faults. Typically a low current fault occurs when the dry type transformer <b>112</b> is wired incorrectly, i.e. a primary winding is shorted to ground. Another instance of a typical low current fault occurs when two phases are shorted together. When a low current fault occurs, the electrical current conducted between junction <b>230</b> and power grid junction <b>232</b> may reach the transformer fault current value for that particular transformer. The transformer fault current value for the one example of the dry type transformer <b>112</b> described above is 524A. The fault current value is determined by the manufacturer as part of the specifications for the transformer. A low current fault protection element provides the fault protection for current values equal to or less than the transformer fault current value.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A high electrical current fault occurs when the transformer <b>112</b> fails. When the transformer <b>112</b> fails, there is no impedance between the primary and secondary windings of the transformer <b>112</b>. The resulting short between the windings of the transformer <b>112</b> causes high amounts of current to flow. With respect to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, when the transformer <b>112</b> fails, the amount of electrical current that flows between junction <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> exceeds the fault current value for the transformer <b>112</b>. When this happens, the low current fault protection element <b>212</b> may not be able to clear in time to prevent significant damage to the power grid <b>126</b>. Therefore, the second fault protection element <b>214</b> is provided to protect the power grid <b>126</b> from the high currents that flow when transformer <b>112</b> fails.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to select the proper electrical current fault protection for the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b>, the auxiliary transformer's fault current value is identified from the manufacturer's specifications. For the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the transformer fault current value for the one example of the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> described above is 94A. Any fault current equal to or less than 94A is considered a low current fault. As discussed previously, the 3A bay-o-net fuse or the 5A Kearney Dual Element fuse provides low current fault protection for the third fault protection element <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second fault protection element <b>214</b> is also used to protect the power grid <b>126</b> should the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> fail. The second fault protection element <b>214</b> clears if either the dry type transformer <b>112</b> or the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> experiences a failure. Using the same high current fault protection device <b>214</b> for both the dry type transformer <b>112</b> and the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> is an efficient way to provide high current fault protection without the added expense of providing another fuse.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An alternative embodiment for the power supply <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. In this embodiment a fourth fault protection element <b>238</b> is connected in series between the third fault protection element <b>220</b> and the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b>. The fourth fault protection element <b>238</b> provides added electrical current fault protection for the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b>. In this embodiment, a fuse model #9F54DCA901 manufactured by General Electric is used as the fourth fault protection element <b>238</b>. The fourth fault protection element <b>238</b> also clears should the temperature of the oil exceed the threshold of 120° C.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Electrical current characteristic curve graphs are commonly used by those skilled in the art to choose the proper current fault protection devices. These graphs illustrate the response characteristics of different fault protection devices. The graphs show certain characteristics of the transformer that is protected by the fault protection devices. The characteristics of the transformer that are graphed include, but are not limited to, rated current, maximum fault current, and inrush current. By graphically displaying the transformer information along with the fault protection information of each of the fuses, one of ordinary skill in the art can determine if the fault responsiveness of a particular fuse or collection of fuses will adequately protect a particular transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an electrical current response graph <b>400</b> displaying response curves related to the protection of the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> for the embodiment of the power supply <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The curves and particular values shown in the current response graph <b>400</b> are for the previously described examples of the dry type transformer <b>112</b> and auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> and the particular fuses used for the fault protection elements and thus may be different for other examples for those transformers and fault protection elements. The X-axis for the electrical current response graph <b>400</b> is the amount of current flowing through the transformer <b>114</b> and is displayed in Amperes. The Y-axis is the amount of time the current is flowing through the transformer <b>114</b> and is displayed in seconds. For the electrical current response graph <b>400</b> the values of current versus time are graphed logarithmically. On the electrical current response graph <b>400</b>, the transformer rated current is shown at <b>470</b>. This is the typical amount of current the transformer <b>114</b> will conduct during normal operations. The fault current of 94 amperes for transformer <b>114</b> is shown at <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The auxiliary transformer inrush current characteristic is displayed at <b>410</b>. The transformer inrush current is the amount of current that flows through the transformer <b>114</b> when the transformer <b>114</b> is initially brought on line. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, shows that the moment transformer <b>114</b> is brought on line, the inrush current is about 50 amperes. As current flows through the transformer <b>114</b>, the transformer windings become energized and the impedance increases. As the impedance increases, the inrush current decreases. After about 10 seconds, the transformer is fully energized and no more current will be conducted due to the inrush properties of the transformer <b>114</b>. When selecting fault protection elements, it is important that fuses with response characteristics greater than the inrush current curve <b>410</b> are selected. Otherwise, the fuse clears while the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> is energizing and the transformer <b>114</b> never begins its normal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The response curve for the Kearney Dual element fuse used as the third fault protection element <b>220</b> is shown at <b>420</b>. The curve characteristics of the GE Fuse used as the fourth fault protection element <b>238</b> is shown at <b>430</b>, while the curve characteristics for the Shorty PRCL fuse used as the second fault protection element <b>214</b> is shown at <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The electrical current response graph <b>400</b> shows the third fault protection element response curve <b>430</b> crossing the second fault protection element response curve <b>440</b> at crossover point <b>450</b>. The crossover point for a typical low current fault/high current fault protection scheme should occur at approximately the fault current value <b>460</b> for transformer <b>114</b>. However the high current fault protection device (second fault protection element <b>214</b>) was chosen based on the dry type transformer <b>112</b> characteristics. Therefore the cross over point <b>450</b> is much higher than would be expected for an auxiliary transformer <b>114</b> as described previously in the one example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To provide additional fault protection nearer to the transformer fault current <b>460</b>, the fourth fault protection element <b>238</b> is used. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the fourth fault protection element <b>238</b> is connected in series between the third fault protection element <b>220</b> and the auxiliary transformer <b>114</b>. The protection configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is intended to ensure that either the third fault protection element <b>220</b> or the fourth fault protection element <b>238</b> will clear at or near the transformer fault current <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a top view of the enclosure <b>128</b>. At the front of the enclosure is the accessible compartment <b>130</b>, and at the rear of the enclosure <b>128</b> is the oil filled compartment <b>132</b>. The accessible compartment <b>130</b> has a right door <b>302</b> and a left door <b>304</b>. These doors can be locked and unlocked by utility company maintenance personnel. The low voltage wiring <b>120</b>, the high voltage wiring <b>124</b> and the power grid wiring <b>122</b> are brought up through the floor of the accessible compartment <b>130</b>. In between the accessible compartment <b>130</b> and the oil filled compartment <b>132</b> is a shared wall <b>306</b> of the enclosure <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a front view of the enclosure <b>128</b> with the left door <b>304</b> and right door <b>302</b> removed.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first toggle switch <b>310</b> is connected to the first interrupting element <b>210</b>. The operation of the first current interrupting element <b>210</b> is controlled by the first toggle switch <b>310</b>. If the first current interrupting element <b>210</b> is closed, a craftsperson would physically move the first toggle switch <b>310</b> from a first position to a second position to open element <b>210</b>. To subsequently close the first current interrupting element <b>210</b> the crafts person would move the first toggle switch <b>310</b> from the second position to the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second current interrupting element <b>216</b> is controlled by the second toggle switch <b>312</b>. In order to open or close the second current interrupting element <b>216</b>, the second toggle switch <b>312</b> is operated in the same manner as described above for the first toggle switch <b>310</b>. Similarly, the third toggle switch <b>314</b> controls the operation of the third current interrupting element <b>218</b> and is also operated the same way as the first toggle switch <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bay-o-net fuse used for the first fault protection element <b>212</b> is housed in the bay-o-net fuse holder <b>316</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, there are three fuses holders <b>316</b>, one for each phase of the power supply <b>200</b>. The typical bay-o-net fuse holder has a fault identification mechanism to allow a craftsperson to quickly identify if a fuse has cleared. To replace a cleared fuse, the craftsperson opens the fuse holder, removes the cleared fuse and replaces the fuse.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The high voltage wiring <b>124</b> connects to the high voltage dead front connectors <b>320</b>. As was previously described, the high voltage dead front connector <b>320</b> provides the electrical connectivity between the dry type transformer <b>112</b> and the power supply <b>200</b>. The high voltage dead front connectors <b>320</b> are the electrical equivalent of junction <b>230</b>. The power grid wiring <b>122</b> attaches to the power grid dead front connectors <b>318</b> and connects the power supply <b>200</b> with the power grid <b>126</b>. The low voltage wiring <b>120</b> attaches to the low voltage dead front connectors <b>322</b>. The high voltage wires <b>124</b>, the low voltage wires <b>120</b> and the power grid wires <b>122</b> have right angle connectors which allow easy attachment to their respective dead front connectors <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, and <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Mounted on the shared wall <b>306</b> of the enclosure <b>128</b> are several gauges. A craftsperson can determine the present temperature and pressure in oil filled compartment <b>132</b> by observing the temperature gauge <b>326</b> and the pressure gauge <b>328</b>. The gauges <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> allow the craftsperson to identify if the conditions are safe enough to open the oil filled compartment <b>132</b>. The enclosure <b>128</b> also has a valve <b>324</b> to expedite the removal of oil from the oil filled compartment <b>132</b> and a plug <b>330</b> to add oil if the oil filled compartment <b>132</b> is low on oil.</p>
