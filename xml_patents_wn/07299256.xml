<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to Internet and World Wide Web (“WWW”). More particularly, this invention relates to creating a virtual link between a three-dimensional (“3-D”) physical location (or entity) and its web representation for fast and convenient web navigation without employing any physical object to host the link at the physical location.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is known, the world we live in is a physical world that is formed by physical entities such as people, places, and things (or objects). For example, a bookstore is a place. So is a tourist attraction, a museum, an exhibition hall, a conference room, or a home. A book in a bookstore, a painting in a museum is a thing. Likewise, a TV in a house is a thing. A bus stop can be referred to as a place.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With rapid growth of the Internet and widespread use of the Web (i.e., WWW), more and more physical entities (e.g., restaurants, hotels, tourist attraction spots) have their own web pages. This form of representation for the physical entities is typically referred to as non-physical or virtual representation. In this case, each physical entity can have one or more web pages. In addition, each web page can also represent one or more physical entities. These web pages use text, audio, video, and/or images to describe or illustrate their respective physical entities. The web pages may also provide services (e.g., e-commerce) for their physical entities. A person can simply go to the web pages of a physical entity to get information about the physical entity, or to conduct business transaction with the physical entity (i.e., on-line transaction or e-commerce). These web pages form the virtual world or cyberspace of the physical world. The web representation allows the physical entities to become more useful, convenient, and accessible. For example, instead of physically posting, at a particular bus stop, the arrival and departure schedules of various buses at that particular bus stop, the bus stop is equipped with its own web page which lists all the arrival and departure times so customers can access the information anywhere and anytime so long as they have the web address of the web page. The web page is also automatically updated in real time, thus avoiding the need for the employees of the bus company to physically post any change of the posted schedule. This provides people with accurate information cost-effectively and efficiently. As a further example, a restaurant or hotel may have a web page that publishes its offering and prices. The restaurant may even allow on-line reservation and/or take-out orders. The hotel may allow on-line booking. The web page might also provide easy email access for asking questions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, although a physical entity in real world may have its web-based representation, the two are not tightly connected. This means that there is no means for bridging the two worlds together. In other words, this prior art structure does not provide means for linking people who are interested in a physical entity to its web representation. For a person to find the right web page of a physical entity, the person either has to memorize the web address of the web page, or has to find the web page through searching and browsing the Web. This causes difficulty and inconvenience for the users to access those web pages. The inconvenience has increasingly become obvious because the Web has now grown to contain millions of millions of web sites and/or web pages.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This problem is also amplified by the fact that more and more people can access the Web through their mobile devices. As we know, with the increased availability of highly functional portable or mobile devices and deployment of wireless networking options, more and more people are always connected to the Web. Wherever they are, they have ready access to the virtual world through their mobile browser.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Prior solutions have been proposed to solving the problem. One prior solution is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a physical entity <b>11</b> has its web page <b>12</b>. A web address or URL (Universal Resource Locator) beacon <b>14</b> is physically placed adjacent to the physical entity <b>11</b>. The beacon <b>14</b> stores the web address of the web page <b>12</b> of the physical entity <b>11</b>. The beacon <b>14</b> also transmits or broadcast the web address of the web page <b>12</b> so that any user with a beacon receiving device (e.g., the client system <b>20</b>) can receive the web address of the web page <b>12</b> of the physical entity <b>11</b> when the user with the beacon receiving device is near the physical entity <b>14</b>. Thus, the beacon <b>14</b> provides the linking of between the physical entity <b>11</b> and its web representation (i.e., web page <b>12</b>) such that easy and quick navigation of the web can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, disadvantages are still associated with such prior arrangement. One disadvantage is that the URL beacon is a physical thing that must be physically placed adjacent the physical entity or location. If the web address of the physical entity is changed, the URL beacon must be updated on the site unless the beacon is connected via a network. On-site maintenance is also required for the installed beacon. For example, if the beacon is damaged or broken, a person must be sent to the site to fix or replace the beacon. If the beacon is powered by battery, the battery must be periodically replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the physical beacon typically has a very limited transmission range. A user with a beacon receiver must almost be at the location of the physical entity to receive the beacon transmission of the stored web address. If the user is only in the vicinity, but not at the location, the user typically does not receive the beacon transmission.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One feature of the present invention is to provide a virtual linkage between a 3-D (three-dimensional) physical location or entity and its related web representation in order to allow for easy, quick, and convenient web navigation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another feature of the present invention is to link the virtual world (e.g., WWW) with the 3-D physical world with minimized physical effort.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further feature of the present invention is to link a web page with a 3-D physical entity or location without the need to consider any physical constraints of the linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Below described is a virtual beacon creator system for creating a link between a physical location and its web page. The system includes a user interface that receives user input of positional data of the physical location and a web address of the web page. An association module is then coupled to the user interface to create the link by creating an electronic file containing the positional data and the web address such that a person with a receiver system near the physical location can receive the electronic file to access the web page without browsing. This makes the link a virtual link which is not physically located at the physical location.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A system for virtually posting, at a physical location, a web address of a web page associated with the physical location is also described. The system includes a virtual link creator that creates an electronic file that contains positional data of the physical location and the web address. The system also includes a virtual link transmission system that receives the electronic file and transmits the electronic file to any receiver system at or near the physical location via a wireless network such that the web address of the web page is virtually posted at the physical location without employing a physical object to host the web address at the physical location.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A web navigation system is also described. The web navigation system includes a virtual link creator that creates an electronic file that contains positional data of a physical location and a web address of a web page associated with the physical location. A virtual link server system receives the electronic file. The server system can transmit the electronic file to any remote receiver system near the physical location via a communication network. A receiver system, capable of communicating with the server system and accessing external Internet, receives the electronic file from the server system when the receiver system is near the physical location such that the web address of the web page is virtually posted at the physical location without employing a physical object to host the web address at the physical location.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a web navigation system <b>40</b> that implements one embodiment of the present invention. The web navigation system <b>40</b> includes a virtual beacon creator <b>50</b>, a virtual beacon server <b>60</b>, and a virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b>. A wireless network <b>42</b> is used for communications among the above mentioned systems <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>70</b>. In addition, a wired network is used for communication between the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> and the virtual beacon server <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> can also be referred to as a virtual link creator. The virtual beacon server can also be referred to as a virtual link server. In addition, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> can be referred to as a virtual link receiver or a receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a physical location <b>45</b> and a web page <b>46</b> hosted in a content web server (not shown). The web page <b>46</b> can be accessed via the wireless network <b>42</b> by the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b>. This means that the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> has Internet access capability. The web page <b>46</b> is related to the physical location <b>45</b>. This means that the physical location <b>45</b> is represented in the virtual world by the web page <b>46</b>. Alternatively, the physical location <b>45</b> has two or more web pages and the web page <b>46</b> represents two or more physical locations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the web navigation system <b>40</b> bridges the physical real world and the virtual world together such that easy, quick, and convenient web navigation is achieved with minimized physical effort for the bridging. The web navigation system <b>40</b> achieves this by allowing the web address of the web page <b>46</b> for the physical location <b>45</b> to be virtually posted at the physical location <b>45</b> without employing any physical object (e.g., a physical beacon, a display screen, or a poster) to post the web address at the physical location <b>45</b>. This means that the web navigation system <b>40</b> provides a virtual beacon (or virtual link) (i.e., the virtual beacon <b>91</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that functions to post, display, or broadcast the web address of the web page <b>46</b> at the physical location <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, the term “physical beacon” refers to an electronic device or module that stores a web address and can transmit or broadcast the stored web address. The term “virtual beacon” or “virtual link”, however, does not refer to any physical object such as the physical beacon. Instead, this term refers to an electronic file that contains the web address. The electronic file, however, serves the similar function as the physical beacon. The virtual beacon or virtual link can also be referred to as a web-sign.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, the term “physical location” refers not only to a geographical location, but to a physical entity as well. As described above, a physical entity can be a bookstore, a museum, a conference room, a hotel room, or an item displayed at the bookstore or museum. The physical entity can also be a convention center, a car displayed at the convention center, or a bus terminal or stop.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although the term “physical location” refers to both the geographical location as well as physical entity, there is no confusion because every geographical location has a unique positional data (e.g., latitude is “53.456789” and longitude is “123.456789”). This is also true for any physical entity located at a geographical location. In this case, the physical entity assumes the positional data of the geographical location at which the physical entity is located. This allows the term “physical location” to refer to either the geographical location or a physical entity at a geographical location.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The physical location <b>45</b> can be referred to using the street address (e.g., 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, Calif.), or the unique positional data. But if the street address is used to refer to the location <b>45</b>, map data should be stored to convert the street address into the actual positional data.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As will be described in more detail below, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> creates the virtual beacon <b>91</b> for the physical location <b>45</b>. The virtual beacon <b>91</b> is essentially a location-based electronic file (i.e., the file <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). This means that the electronic file <b>92</b> contains the positional data of the physical location <b>45</b> and the web address of the web page <b>46</b>. In addition, other data (e.g., access range, direction, name of the web address, time range during which the virtual beacon is active) may also be included in the electronic file <b>92</b> that forms the virtual beacon <b>91</b>. The location-based electronic file <b>92</b> is then sent by the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> via either the wireless network <b>42</b> or the wired network <b>43</b>. Each of the networks <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> employs an open standard communication protocol (e.g., the Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP)) for communication. Thus, each of the networks <b>42</b>-<b>43</b> is an Internet network.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The virtual beacon server <b>60</b> then sends the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> to any external receiver system (e.g., the receiver system <b>70</b>) via the wireless network <b>42</b> when the external receiver system is at a particular location and sends a request for all virtual beacon files that have positional data indicating locations that are near the location at which the receiver system is currently located. For example, when the receiver system <b>70</b> is near the physical location <b>45</b> and requests to receive all virtual beacon files that contain positional data indicating locations that are near the location at which the receiver system <b>70</b> is located, the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> will send the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> to the receiver system <b>70</b>. The receiver system <b>70</b> then uses the web address contained in the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> to access the web page <b>46</b>, thus allowing the web address of the web page <b>46</b> to be virtually posted at the physical location <b>45</b> without employing any physical object to host the web address at the physical location <b>45</b>. This makes the virtual beacon <b>91</b> a virtual link or virtual beacon which is not physically located at the physical location <b>45</b>. The web navigation system <b>40</b> will be described in more detail below, also in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> creates the virtual beacon <b>91</b> by creating the electronic file <b>92</b> (both shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for the physical location <b>45</b>. As described above, the virtual beacon <b>91</b> is not a physical object, but rather a location-based electronic file (i.e., the electronic file <b>92</b>) that contains data. The data contained in the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> include a positional data of the physical location <b>45</b> (e.g., latitude=“37.345” and longitude=“−122.56”). In addition, the data contained in the electronic file <b>92</b> also include an access range data (e.g., range=2000 feet), a tag or label data (e.g., &lt;label&gt;=the hospital). Moreover, other data may also be included. For example, the data in the electronic file <b>92</b> may include a directional data specifying the direction or orientation of the beacon projection of the virtual beacon <b>91</b>, as well as time range data indicating the times during which the virtual beacon <b>91</b> is active. The beacon projection means the direction at which the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> can be received by an external receiver system (e.g., the receiver system <b>70</b>) at or near the location of the virtual beacon <b>91</b>. These other data can be collectively referred to as control data, property data, or control information.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be implemented by a computer system with communication functions with external networks. In other embodiments, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> can be implemented by software, hardware, or firmware. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the structure of the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b>, which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> includes an association module <b>62</b>, a user interface <b>64</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>66</b>, a web gateway <b>68</b>, and a positioning module <b>72</b>. The user interface <b>64</b> is used to interact with the user of the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b>, and to receive user inputs <b>74</b>-<b>78</b> of data that will be used to form the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user inputs include a range data input <b>74</b>, a position data input <b>75</b>, a tag/label data input <b>76</b>, a time data input <b>77</b>, and a web address (i.e., URL) data input <b>78</b>. In addition, the user interface <b>64</b> may also include a map data database <b>79</b>. This database <b>79</b> is used when the position data input <b>75</b> is actually an address input (e.g., 3000 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, Calif.). In this case, the user interface <b>64</b> accesses the database <b>79</b> to convert the address input into the positional data (e.g., latitude=“12.345” and longitude=“89.123”).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows one example of the user interface <b>64</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the user interface <b>64</b> provides the interface (i.e., <b>64</b><i>a</i>) for address input and the interface (i.e., <b>64</b><i>b</i>) for positional data input. The interface <b>64</b><i>b </i>also includes fields for other user data inputs (e.g., range, time, label, web address).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the association module <b>62</b> receives all the user inputs <b>74</b>-<b>78</b> from the user interface <b>64</b>. The association module <b>62</b> then forms the electronic file <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that represents the virtual beacon <b>91</b>. The electronic file <b>92</b> contains (1) the positional data of the physical location <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at which the virtual beacon <b>91</b> is created or specified and (2) the control data (e.g., the web address of the web page <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) associated with the physical location <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the access range of the virtual beacon <b>91</b>, and the tag/label of the web address, etc.). The association module <b>62</b> can be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The positioning module <b>72</b> is employed to provide the positional data of the current position of the creator <b>50</b>. This allows the association module <b>62</b> to require no positional data input from the user interface <b>64</b> when creating a virtual beacon file. In this case, the user of the creator <b>50</b> only needs to indicate that the virtual beacon takes the current position of the creator <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, the positioning module <b>72</b> is a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver module. Alternatively, the positioning module <b>72</b> can be implemented using other known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> and <b>5</b>, the location-based electronic file <b>92</b> is then sent by the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> via either the wireless network <b>42</b> or the wired network <b>43</b>. Each of the networks <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> employs an open standard communication protocol (e.g., the Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP)) for communication. Thus, each of the networks <b>42</b>-<b>43</b> is an Internet network. This means that the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> received by the server <b>60</b> from the creator <b>50</b> are in the XML (Extended Markup Language) format. Alternatively, other known web data formats may be employed for the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transmission from the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> is dependent on the connection of the creator <b>50</b> with the external server <b>60</b>. If the creator <b>50</b> is connected to the wired network <b>43</b>, then the web gateway <b>68</b> is used to transmit the electronic file <b>92</b> created by the creator <b>50</b>. If the creator <b>50</b> is connected to the wireless network <b>42</b>, then the electronic file <b>92</b> is transmitted by the wireless transceiver <b>66</b>. If the creator <b>50</b> is connected to both networks <b>42</b>-<b>43</b>, then the electronic file <b>92</b> can be sent by either network. The wireless transceiver <b>66</b> can be implemented using known technology and the web gateway <b>68</b> can be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> receives the location-based electronic file <b>92</b> representing the virtual beacon <b>91</b> (both shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for the physical location <b>45</b>, the server <b>60</b> stores the electronic file <b>92</b>. When requested, the server <b>60</b> sends the electronic file <b>92</b> to the requesting receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b>). The server <b>60</b> sends the virtual beacon files it has stored either in the web format (e.g., XML format) or in the email format. Thus, the server <b>60</b> is basically a combination of a web server and an email server. The server <b>60</b> has a web address so that remote systems having web browsing capability can access the server <b>60</b>. In addition, the server <b>60</b> also has an email address. The structure of the server <b>60</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the server <b>60</b> includes a gateway <b>101</b>, an email server <b>102</b>, a web server <b>103</b>, a virtual beacon store <b>104</b>, and a filtering module <b>105</b>. Alternatively, the server <b>60</b> can function without some of the above-mentioned modules. For example, the server <b>60</b> may not have the filtering module <b>105</b> or the email module <b>102</b>. The gateway <b>101</b> is used to interface the server <b>60</b> with the networks <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Thus, the gateway <b>101</b> is also an Internet-enabled gateway.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The email server <b>102</b> is used to send virtual beacon electronic files (e.g., the file <b>92</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to remote receivers (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The email server <b>102</b> has an email address and can send the virtual beacon files in e-mail format. The email server <b>102</b> can be implemented using known technology. The email server <b>102</b> is typically used to delivery the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b> to a remote receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) instantly (i.e., without waiting for the receiver to request such virtual beacons). The server <b>102</b> can also send the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b> to a remote receiver when the receiver requests such files.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The web server <b>103</b> is used to delivery the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b> to a remote receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) when the receiver requests such files (i.e., on-demand delivery). The web server <b>103</b> also includes a web address so that external systems can access the web server <b>103</b> for the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b>. The web server <b>103</b> can be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During operation, the gateway <b>101</b> receives external location-based virtual beacon files (e.g., the electronic file <b>92</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) from external virtual beacon creators (e.g., the creator <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The gateway <b>101</b> then sends the file to the virtual beacon store <b>104</b> where the file is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the gateway <b>101</b> receives a request from an external receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for virtual beacon files with positional data indicating positions that are in the vicinity of the position of the requesting receiver, the gateway <b>101</b> will cause either the email server <b>102</b> or the web server <b>103</b> to reply. Which one of the servers <b>102</b>-<b>103</b> should be engaged to reply depends on the request. If the request is an email request, then the email server <b>102</b> is engaged. Otherwise, the web server <b>103</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the email server <b>102</b> is also used to perform the instant delivery service of the virtual beacon files. In this case, the email server <b>102</b> needs to know the recipient's email address (i.e., subscription). In this case, as soon as the gateway <b>101</b> receives a new file for a new virtual beacon, the email server <b>102</b> checks to see if it needs to send the newly created virtual beacon to one or more of its existing subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The filtering module <b>105</b> is used to filter out the virtual beacon files that are not supposed to be sent out. The filtering module <b>105</b> does this by using the access range of the requesting receiver and the projection range (or access range) of a virtual beacon to determine if the virtual beacon file needs to be transferred. For example, if a virtual beacon file specifies a projection (or access) range of fifteen meters while the request from the requesting receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b>) specifies a range of three meters as vicinity, and if the virtual beacon specifies a location that is two meters from the current position or location of the requesting receiver, then the virtual beacon file will be transferred to the requesting receiver without being filtered out by the filtering module <b>105</b>. The filtering module <b>105</b> may also implement different filtering schemes. Alternatively, the server <b>60</b> does not include this module.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> is employed to receive the virtual beacons (e.g., the virtual beacon <b>91</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) from the server <b>60</b>. The receiver <b>70</b> is a portable or mobile electronic device with wireless (and/or wired) Internet access functionality. In one embodiment, the receiver <b>70</b> is a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) or a personal organizer. In another embodiment, the receiver <b>70</b> is a palm-top computer or a mobile computer. Alternatively, the receiver <b>70</b> can be any kind of information appliance, or any kind of small portable handheld electronic device or appliance which has limited processing, storage, and display resources (e.g., a watch, a cellular phone, or a pager). The operation of the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> is at a particular physical location (e.g., a bank, a convention center, a bus stop, or simply at a corner of a street in a town) and wants to have all the virtual beacons located in the vicinity of the receiver <b>70</b>, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> accesses the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> via the wireless network <b>42</b>. For example, when the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> is at or near the physical location <b>45</b> and wants to know all the virtual beacons in the vicinity of the current location at which the receiver <b>70</b> is located, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> sends a request to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> and receives all the virtual beacon files that contain the positional data indicating positions that are within the vicinity of the current location of the receiver <b>70</b>. The range of vicinity (i.e., access range of the receiver <b>70</b>) is specified by the receiver <b>70</b> in its request to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b>. For example, the receiver <b>70</b> can specify an access range of fifteen meters or thirty meters. This means the vicinity is fifteen meters and any virtual beacon located within fifteen meters from the current location of the receiver <b>70</b> will be sent from the sender <b>60</b> to the receiver <b>70</b>. The vicinity and access range will be described in more detail below, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The receiver <b>70</b> then displays all the virtual beacons received from the server <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows one example of the displayed virtual beacons of the receiver <b>70</b>. The virtual beacon files sent from the server <b>60</b> to the receiver <b>70</b> are in the XML (Extensible Markup Language) data format. If the server <b>60</b> sends the virtual beacon files through its e-mail server (i.e., the email server <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), then the files are in the email format.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, the wireless network <b>42</b> is a wireless Internet network that allows the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> to communicate with the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> using an open standard communication protocol (e.g., HTTP or email protocol). Thus, the communication between the server <b>60</b> and the receiver <b>70</b> follows the traditional Internet or email communication. This means that the server <b>60</b> has a web address or email address and the receiver <b>70</b> includes a web browsing capability or email capability. The receiver <b>70</b> accesses the server <b>60</b> using a web browser and the web address of the server <b>60</b>. If email is used for the communication, the receiver <b>70</b> accesses the server <b>60</b> using its email software and the email address of the server <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The receiver <b>70</b> accesses the server <b>60</b> with a request (not shown). In the request, the receiver <b>70</b> specifies its current position by including the positional data of the current position of the receiver <b>70</b> in the request. In addition, the receiver <b>70</b> also specifies, in the request, the virtual access range of the receiver <b>70</b>. This limits the range or distance that the receiver <b>70</b> can receive a location-based virtual beacon file. For example, if a virtual beacon file specifies a location that is beyond the access range of the receiver <b>70</b> from the current location of the receiver <b>70</b>, the receiver <b>70</b> will not receive that virtual beacon file from the server <b>60</b>. But if the virtual beacon file specifies a location that is within the access range of the receiver <b>70</b> from the current location of the receiver <b>70</b>, the receiver <b>70</b> will receive that virtual beacon file from the server <b>60</b>. Alternatively, the request does not specify the virtual access range of the receiver system <b>70</b>. In this case, the range data is stored in the receiver <b>70</b> and the filtering process takes place within the receiver <b>70</b> before the receiver <b>70</b> displays the received virtual beacon files.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The concept of access range is introduced to limit the traffic between the server <b>60</b> and the receiver <b>70</b> along the network <b>42</b>. As is known, physical beacons have physical constraints and that effectively limits access range. While we would like a system where users are not limited by the physical constraints we still need some constraints. Otherwise the system would cause users to see a very large number of virtual beacons, causing extreme cognitive overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the web navigation system <b>40</b>, since a virtual beacon is a virtual entity and therefore we need the constraint of a virtual access range. The user should only be able to experience the virtual beacons in his digital horizon. We define a digital horizon as a set of all the virtual beacons that are “activated” as a result of the user being in their range. While range is the property of an individual virtual beacon, the digital horizon is the temporal and spatial property of an individual user.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the structure of the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the receiver <b>70</b> includes a positioning module <b>111</b>, an orientation module <b>112</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>113</b>, a web browser <b>114</b>, an email module <b>115</b>, a kernel <b>116</b>, and a virtual beacon projector <b>110</b>. These modules are connected together via an internal bus <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The positioning module <b>111</b> provides the positional data of the current position of the receiver <b>70</b>. In one embodiment, the positioning module <b>111</b> is a GPS receiver module. Alternatively, the positioning module <b>111</b> can be implemented using other known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The orientation module <b>112</b> determines the orientation of the receiver <b>70</b>. This means that the orientation module <b>112</b> determines the direction or orientation the receiver <b>70</b> is currently facing. In one embodiment, the orientation module <b>112</b> is a magnetometer. In another embodiment, the orientation module <b>112</b> is a magnetic compass.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The wireless transceiver <b>113</b> is used to send requests for virtual beacons to the remote server <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and to receive virtual beacon electronic files from the server <b>60</b> via the network <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The transceiver <b>113</b> can be implemented using any known communication technology and is network-specific. Thus the transceiver <b>113</b> will not be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The web browser <b>114</b> is used to generate the request and to use the request to access the remote server <b>60</b>. In other words, the web browser <b>114</b> is used to control communication between the server <b>60</b> and the receiver <b>70</b>. The web browser <b>114</b> can also be implemented using known technology. Like the web browser <b>114</b>, the email module <b>115</b> is used to generate the request in email format and to use the request to access the remote server <b>60</b>. The email module <b>115</b> can also be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The kernel <b>116</b> is used to communicate and control power management and other features of the hardware of the receiver <b>70</b>. It also acts as an interface, abstracting the hardware from the other components. This is important as different hardware configuration could be used for different application. The kernel <b>116</b> includes an algorithm to calibrate the orientation module <b>112</b> and also to process its results into heading, correcting for inclination and declination. The other important functionality of the kernel <b>116</b> includes keeping the onboard cache refreshed. On the users demand, the kernel <b>116</b> queries the positioning module <b>111</b> for the current location, ambiguates it by truncating the trailing digits, and uses the data to queries the server <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The response—WsML—is stored in the internal buffer of the virtual beacon projector <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The main function of the projector <b>110</b> is to display the received virtual beacon files. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows one example of the display. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each virtual beacon is displayed with the location information with respect to the current location of the receiver <b>70</b>. The structure of the projector <b>110</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the virtual beacon projector <b>110</b> includes a vectoring filter <b>131</b>, a digital horizon module <b>132</b>, a buffer <b>133</b>, and a user interface <b>134</b>. The user interface <b>134</b> is employed to allow the user of the receiver to communicate with the projector <b>110</b>. For example, when the projector <b>110</b> displays a number of virtual beacons such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and the user wants to access the web page of one of them, the user can do so by clicking on one of the listed hyperlinks. The user interface <b>134</b> also includes a display (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The user interface <b>134</b> can be implemented using known technology and will not be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The digital horizon module <b>132</b> is used to restrict the virtual access range of the receiver <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>). This limits the range or distance that the receiver <b>70</b> can receive a location-based virtual beacon file. As described above, the user should only be able to experience the virtual beacons in his digital horizon. We define a digital horizon as a set of all the virtual beacons that are “activated” as a result of the user being in their range. While range is the property of an individual virtual beacon, the digital horizon is the temporal and spatial property of an individual user. Thus, the range data is stored in the buffer <b>133</b> and the filtering process takes place within the receiver <b>70</b> before the receiver <b>70</b> displays the received virtual beacon files. Alternatively, the digital horizon module <b>132</b> is not included in the projector <b>110</b> and the filtering process takes place in the server <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The vectoring filter <b>131</b> is used to filter the virtual beacons that are in the direction pointed by the receiver <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>) and display them on the user interface <b>134</b>. The kernel <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in response to changes in the magnetometer readings of the orientation module <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, invokes the vectoring filter <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident to those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.</p>
