<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a printer, a facsimile or a copier, and particularly relates to an image forming apparatus having a sheet feeding device capable of continuously feeding printing sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to feed printing sheets at constant intervals, a conventional image forming apparatus has a sheet sensor on a sheet feeding path from a sheet storing portion to a photosensitive drum. A separating member lifts a trailing end of a preceding sheet so that the trailing end moves out of a detectable area of the sheet sensor, while the sheet sensor is used to position a leading end of a subsequent printing sheet. After the positioning of the leading end of the subsequent printing sheet is completed, the separating member moves the trailing end of the preceding sheet downward, so that a constant spatial interval is formed between the preceding sheet and the subsequent sheet. An example of such an image forming apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 5-193782 (in particular, Page 1 and FIG. 1).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in the above described image forming apparatus, it is necessary that the printing sheet warps with a suitable balance when the separating member lifts the printing sheet. Thus, the separating member needs to have a member that acts on the printing sheet uniformly throughout the width of the printing sheet, and therefore the size of the sheet feeding device may increase. Moreover, it is necessary to control the movement of the separating member in addition to a general sheet feeding device, and therefore the controlling of the sheet feeding device may become complicated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present invention is to provide an image forming apparatus capable of feeding printing sheets so that constant spatial intervals are formed therebetween, without requiring significant change to a general image forming apparatus, and without requiring a complicated controlling system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides an image forming apparatus including a storing portion in which a plurality of printing media are stored, a first feeding unit capable of feeding one printing medium after another from the printing media stored in the storing portion to the outside of the storing portion, a second feeding unit that feeds the printing medium (having been fed by the first feeding unit) along a predetermined feeding path, a timing detection unit that detects a timing when the printing medium reaches a predetermined position along the feeding path, a protruding amount detection unit that detects a protruding amount of a subsequent printing medium protruding from the storing portion when the second feeding unit feeds a preceding printing medium prior to the subsequent printing medium, and a feeding control unit that determines a timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing medium according to a timing detected by the timing detection unit and the protruding amount detected by the protruding amount detection unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With such an arrangement, it becomes possible to accomplish an image forming apparatus capable of successively feeding a plurality of printing media at constant spatial intervals. Moreover, the image forming apparatus can be accomplished by making a relatively small change to a general sheet feeding device of the image forming apparatus. Furthermore, a complicated control system is not needed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the sheet feeding device <b>31</b> includes a second feeding roller <b>3</b> and a retard roller <b>4</b> provided outside the storing portion <b>1</b> and disposed at the downstream side of the first feeding roller <b>2</b> in the direction B.

A guide <b>6</b> is provided for guiding the printing sheet <b>10</b> along the sheet feeding path. The retard roller <b>4</b> is provided in opposition to the second feeding roller <b>3</b>. The retard roller <b>4</b> rotates in the same direction as the second feeding roller <b>3</b> (i.e., in the direction opposite to the feeding direction of the printing sheet <b>10</b>) as indicated by an arrow b<b>3</b>. When a plurality of printing sheets <b>10</b> are fed by the first feeding roller <b>2</b> at the same time, the retard roller <b>4</b> separates the printing sheets <b>10</b> from each other.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sheet feeding device <b>31</b> includes a sheet sensor <b>7</b> disposed at the downstream side of the second feeding roller <b>3</b> in the direction B, for detecting a leading end or a trailing end of a printing medium <b>10</b> fed along the sheet feeding path. The sheet sensor <b>7</b> detects the printing sheet <b>10</b> passing through a detecting position on which the sheet sensor <b>7</b> is disposed, and outputs H-level signal when the sheet sensor <b>7</b> detects the printing sheet <b>10</b> and L-level signal when the sheet sensor <b>7</b> does not detect the printing sheet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sheet feeding device <b>31</b> further includes a leading end position sensor <b>9</b>. When a preceding printing sheet <b>10</b> is fed by the first feeding roller <b>2</b> to the second feeding roller <b>3</b>, a subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b> may adhere to the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b> and may protrude from the storing portion <b>1</b> over the sheet reference position R. The protruding amount of the printing sheet <b>10</b> is not constant, and therefore the leading end position sensor <b>9</b> is provided for detecting the protruding amount of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b>.</p>

Each of the reflective sensors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> includes a light emitting portion <b>25</b> that emits light and a light receiving portion <b>26</b> that receives and detects the light.

The leading end position sensor <b>9</b> constitutes a protruding amount detecting unit for detecting the protruding amount A of the printing sheet <b>10</b>. The light receiving portions <b>26</b> of the reflective sensors <b>21</b> through <b>24</b> constitute detecting portions that respectively detect the printing sheet <b>10</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the sheet sensor <b>7</b> includes a base <b>12</b>, a sensor lever <b>14</b> swingably supported by a shaft <b>14</b><i>c </i>on the base <b>12</b>, and a transmissive sensor <b>13</b> mounted on the base <b>12</b>. The sensor lever <b>14</b> includes an arm portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>having a bent portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>pushed by the printing sheet <b>10</b> moving along the sheet feeding path, and a shield portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>that is able to shield the light of the transmissive sensor <b>13</b>. The sensor lever <b>14</b> is urged by a torsion spring (not shown) in a direction indicated by an arrow D to a rotational reference position shown by a solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The transmissive sensor <b>13</b> includes a light emitting portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>and a light receiving portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>that face each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. When the sensor lever <b>14</b> is in the rotational reference position, the shield portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the sensor lever <b>14</b> exists between the light emitting portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the light receiving portion <b>13</b><i>b</i>, with the result that the light receiving portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>does not receive the light from the light emitting portion <b>13</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the printing sheet <b>14</b> proceeds in the direction B along the sheet feeding path, the leading end <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the printing sheet <b>10</b> abuts against the arm portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the sensor lever <b>14</b>, so that the sensor lever <b>14</b> rotates as shown by an arrow C to a rotational detecting position shown by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The sensor lever <b>14</b> stays at this rotational detecting position until the trailing end <b>10</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the printing sheet <b>10</b> passes through the bent portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>of the arm portion <b>14</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, the CPU <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is able to recognize whether the printing sheet <b>10</b> is passing through the sheet sensor <b>7</b> or not, according to the state of the transmissive sensor <b>13</b>, i.e., whether the light receiving portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>receives the light from the light emitting portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>or not. Moreover, the CPU <b>34</b> is able to detect the timing when the leading end <b>10</b><i>a </i>or the trailing end <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the printing sheet <b>10</b> passes through the sheet sensor <b>7</b>, according to the state of the transmissive sensor <b>13</b>. Since the arm portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the sheet sensor <b>7</b> contacts the printing sheet <b>10</b> at a position apart from the transmissive sensor <b>13</b>, it becomes possible to prevent the misdetection caused by sheet dust. The sheet sensor <b>7</b> constitutes a timing detection unit that detects the timing when the printing sheet <b>10</b> reaches a predetermined position along the sheet feeding path.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The operation of the sheet feeding device <b>31</b> will be described. Hereinafter, a preceding printing sheet is denoted by a numeral <b>10</b><sub>1</sub>, and the subsequent printing sheet (fed next to the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1</sub>) is denoted by a numeral <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>. An arbitrary printing sheet is denoted by a numeral <b>10</b> with no numerical subscript.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as the first feeding roller <b>2</b> rotates, the uppermost (i.e., preceding) printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>in the storing portion <b>1</b> is fed in the direction B and reaches the second feeding roller <b>3</b>. In this state, there is a possibility that the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>may move together with the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>because of the static electricity. However, the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is separated from the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>by the retard roller <b>4</b> rotating in the direction opposite to the feeding direction B.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>having reached the second feeding roller <b>3</b> is further fed by the second feeding roller <b>3</b>, and reaches the resist rollers <b>5</b>.

In this period, the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>warps by a predetermined amount, so that the skewing of the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is corrected. When the predetermined time has elapsed after the leading end (or the trailing end) of the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is detected by the sheet sensor <b>7</b>, the resist roller <b>5</b> starts rotating.

Further, there is another possibility that the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>may not protrude over the sheet reference position R and may remain in the storing portion <b>1</b>. Thus, when the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is to be started, the position of the leading end of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>may deviate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The distance from the sheet reference position R to the leading end of the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is defined as the protruding amount A as was described above. The leading end position sensor <b>9</b> detects the protruding amount A and outputs a sheet position detection signal PTD including the information of the protruding amount A. For example, the leading end position sensor <b>9</b> (having the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) outputs the sheet position detection signal PTD including the detection signals from the reflective sensor <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>. The sheet position detection signal PTD is inputted into the CPU <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The detection signal is at H-level when the light receiving portion <b>26</b> receives the light, and at L-level when the light receiving portion <b>26</b> does not receive the light.

If the passage of the trailing end of the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is detected by the sheet sensor <b>7</b>, the CPU <b>34</b> drives the first feeding motor <b>38</b><i>a </i>to start rotating the first feeding roller <b>2</b> when the adjusting time t has elapsed after the trailing end of the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is detected, so that the feeding of the second (subsequent) printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is started (step S<b>4</b>). The first printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>are fed in such a manner that the target spatial interval W is formed between the first printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The CPU <b>34</b> measures an elapsed time after the trailing end <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the first (preceding) printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>passed through the sheet detecting position of the sheet sensor <b>7</b> (i.e., the position G). When the elapsed time reaches a predetermined time sufficient for the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>to abut against the resist rollers <b>5</b> and warps by the predetermined amount, the CPU <b>34</b> starts rotating the resist rollers <b>5</b> to feed the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>to the image forming portion <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (step S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Then, the CPU <b>34</b> checks if the CPU <b>34</b> receives the instruction to end the continuous printing operation from the printer control unit <b>35</b> (step S<b>6</b>).

If the CPU <b>34</b> does not receive the instruction to end the continuous printing operation, the CPU <b>34</b> proceeds to the step S<b>2</b> and calculates the protruding amount A of the third printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>3 </sub>when the trailing end of the second printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>reaches the second feeding roller <b>3</b>. Further, the processes from the step S<b>2</b> to the step S<b>7</b> are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the processes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is possible to continuously rotate the second feeding roller <b>3</b> during the continuous printing operation, or to start rotating the second feeding roller <b>3</b> at a timing (or, prior to a timing) when the first feeding roller <b>2</b> starts rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the above described embodiment, the leading end position sensor <b>9</b> is constructed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, the leading end position sensor <b>9</b> can be replaced by, for example, a leading end position sensor <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the leading end position sensor <b>16</b> includes a line sensor <b>17</b> extending in the direction B and a light source <b>18</b> provided in opposition to the line sensor <b>17</b>. The line sensor <b>17</b> has an image sensor <b>17</b><i>a </i>that receives the light from the light source <b>18</b>. The image sensor <b>17</b><i>a </i>outputs, for example, an electric signal whose level changes according to the amount of the incident light. The line sensor <b>17</b> and the light source <b>18</b> are so disposed that the printing sheet <b>10</b> passes through the gap between the light source <b>18</b> and the line sensor <b>17</b>. The amount of the light incident on the line sensor <b>17</b> changes according to the protruding amount A of the printing sheet <b>10</b> from the sheet reference position R. The electric signal is inputted into the CPU <b>34</b> as the sheet position detection signal PTD. The CPU <b>34</b> has a comparison table stored in a memory, in which the level of the inputted electric signal (i.e., the sheet position detection signal PTD) and the protruding amount A of the printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>are associated with each other. According to the comparison table, the CPU <b>34</b> recognizes the protruding amount A of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>. With such an arrangement, it is possible to use the leading end position sensor <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> instead of the leading end position sensor <b>9</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the above description, the CPU <b>34</b> calculates the protruding amount A of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>based on the sheet position detection signal PTD, and the CPU <b>34</b> determines the timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>based on the protruding amount A. However, it is also possible to previously determine the relationship between the detected position of the leading end of the protruding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>and the timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>. The CPU <b>34</b> determines the timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>directly based on the sheet position detection signal PTD. In this case, the leading end position sensor <b>9</b> constitutes a position detection unit that outputs a positional information (i.e., the sheet position detection signal PTD) of the leading end of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Moreover, in the above description, the timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is determined based on the timing when the trailing of the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is detected by the sheet sensor <b>7</b>. However, it is possible to determine the timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>based on the timing when the leading end of the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is detected by the sheet sensor <b>7</b> and the length of the printing sheet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, according to the sheet feeding device <b>31</b> of Embodiment 1, the timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is determined based on the protruding amount A of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>from the sheet reference position R, and therefore it becomes possible to maintain the constant spatial interval between the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>with high accuracy. Thus, it becomes possible to accomplish the image forming apparatus capable of feeding printing sheets <b>10</b> at constant spatial intervals, without making a significant change to the structure of a general image forming apparatus and without requiring a complicated control system.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, since the spatial intervals between the printing sheets <b>10</b> can be kept constant with high accuracy, it becomes possible to set the spatial intervals between the printing sheets <b>10</b> as short as possible, and therefore it becomes possible to increase the printing speed.</p>

Further, the CPU <b>34</b> determines the time interval T according to the above described equation (3), and instructs the first feeding motor drive circuit <b>36</b><i>a </i>to start feeding the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>. Accordingly, the printing sheets <b>10</b> can be fed at constant spatial intervals (W).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the above description of Embodiment 2, the sheet length D is directly inputted by means of the operation panel <b>45</b>. However, it is possible to employ various alternative arrangements. For example, it is possible that the CPU <b>34</b> sets the sheet length D according to the selection of the size of the printing sheet <b>10</b> (for example, A4 or B5). Alternatively, it is possible that the CPU <b>34</b> automatically detects the sheet length D.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As described above, according to the sheet feeding device of Embodiment 2, it becomes possible to eliminate the sheet sensor <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for detecting the leading end or the trailing end of the printing sheet <b>10</b>. Therefore, in addition to the advantages of Embodiment 1, it becomes possible to simplify the structure of the image forming apparatus and to reduce the cost of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A comparative example with respect to Embodiments of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic view of the main part of a sheet feeding device according to the comparative example. In the comparative example, the sheet feeding mechanism has no leading end position sensor <b>9</b> for detecting the protruding amount of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>. The first feeding roller <b>2</b> starts feeding the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>when the passage of the trailing end of the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is detected by the sheet sensor <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a condition in which two printing sheets <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>are simultaneously fed to the second feeding roller <b>3</b> because of the static electricity or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is fed by the first feeding roller <b>2</b> in the direction B to the outside of the storing portion <b>1</b>, the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>(adhering to the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>because of the static electricity) may also be fed to the outside of the storing portion <b>1</b>. The preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>is fed in the direction B by the second feeding roller <b>3</b> along the sheet feeding path defined by the guide <b>6</b>. The subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is stopped and separated from the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>by the retard roller <b>4</b> that rotates in the direction opposite to the feeding direction B of the printing sheet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">However, the protruding amount A of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is not constant, and therefore the position of the leading end of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>may deviate in a space between the sheet reference position R and the retard roller <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. When the distance from the reference position R to the retard roller <b>4</b> is expressed as F, the protruding amount A of the leading end of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>is expressed as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>0 (mm)≦A (mm)≦F (mm)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Therefore, if the first feeding roller <b>2</b> starts feeding the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>when the sheet sensor <b>7</b> detects the passage of the trailing end of the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1</sub>, the spatial interval between the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2</sub>(shorter than the distance F by the amount A) is not constant. Thus, there is a possibility that the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1 </sub>and the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>may partially overlap with each other on the feeding path, and therefore problems such as a double feeding or a jam of the printing sheets <b>10</b> may occur. In order to prevent the printing sheets <b>10</b> from overlapping with each other, it is necessary to increase the spatial interval between the printing sheets <b>10</b>, and therefore it is difficult to increase the printing speed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In contrast, according to the above described Embodiments 1 and 2 of the present invention, the CPU <b>34</b> determines the timing of starting the feeding of the subsequent printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>2 </sub>according to the protruding amount of the preceding printing sheet <b>10</b><sub>1</sub>, and therefore the spatial interval between the printing sheets <b>10</b> can be kept constant with high accuracy. Therefore, it becomes possible to accomplish the image forming apparatus capable of feeding printing sheets <b>10</b> at constant spatial intervals, without making a significant change to the structure of the general image forming apparatus. Moreover, since the spatial intervals between the printing sheets <b>10</b> can be kept constant with high accuracy, it becomes possible to set the spatial intervals between the printing sheets <b>10</b> as short as possible, and therefore it becomes possible to increase the printing speed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in detail, it should be apparent that modifications and improvements may be made to the invention without departing from spirit and scope of the invention as described in the following claims.</p>
