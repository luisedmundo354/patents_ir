<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/594,608 filed Apr. 22, 2005, and the subject matter thereof is hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to packages, and more particularly to a system for a chip-scale-package.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Integrated circuit devices and packages are used in equipment and products including cars, planes, industrial control systems as well as the appliances and devices we typically associate with electronics. The growing numbers of portable electronics, such as cell phones, portable computers, voice recorders, etc, are some of these devices. However, across virtually all the uses for integrated circuit devices, there continues to be a demand for reducing the size and increasing the features or functions as well as the performance. We want more features for less size, weight and cost from the largest equipment to the smallest device. Continued improvement in integrated circuit devices and packages are a significant part of the smaller size, more functions and high performance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the demand for electronic devices grows, manufacturers are seeking ways to reduce the size and cost of the packaged integrated circuit devices. To meet these needs, packaging technologies are shifting towards smaller dimensions in both the integrated circuit devices and packages. This is driving the demand for smaller integrated circuit device packages and higher I/O pin counts. These smaller packages, such as chip-scale-packages, are scarcely larger than the tiny integrated circuit devices they protect. Unfortunately, this smaller size and the increased functions bring along their own set of problems, many of which have significantly negative effects on the reliability, assembly processes, high volume production and costs of the devices and products in which they are included.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In most chip-scale-packages, a printed circuit board (PCB), film, or lead frame has been used as a base or a substrate. This type of package structure, particularly when using a PCB substrate, has suffered from reliability problems in part due to poor adhesion between molding compounds and the surfaces of the base or substrate. Many chip-scale-packages suffer from poor adhesion between the molding compound and the solder mask of the PCB or film substrate. Similarly, adhesion problems plague the film substrates as well.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As for the lead frame chip-scale-package, attempts for improvements suffer from limitations in increasing the number of the I/O pin counts for the packages. The lead frame types of leads or electrical connections, such as peripheral types of leads, significantly limit the number of the I/O of the package. These packages impose their capacity limitations on the functions of the integrated circuit devices that they contain, rather than address the demands of increasing features and functions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many other attempts have been unsuccessful in meeting the demands of continued decreases in size, increases in functions while improving reliability and cost effective volume manufacturing. These attempts at decreasing size and increasing functions have complicated assembly processes. The attempts have also been difficult to apply in the production processes for the chip-scale-packages. The complications and difficulties have had a negative effect on package reliability and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, a need still remains for a micro chip-scale-package system to provide smaller size, increased I/O pin count, improved reliability, simpler assembly processes and easy implementation in high volume production and lower costs. In view of the increasing demand for improved density of integrated circuit devices and their packages, particularly portable electronic products, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a micro chip-scale-package system providing a metal pattern on an adhesion material, attaching an integrated circuit die to the metal pattern, and molding an encapsulant over the integrated circuit die and the metal pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain embodiments of the invention have other aspects in addition to or in place of those mentioned or obvious from the above. The aspects will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following description, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known circuits, and process steps are not disclosed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Likewise, the drawings showing embodiments of the apparatus/device are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown greatly exaggerated in the drawing FIGS. Similarly, although the sectional views in the drawings for ease of description show the invention with surfaces as oriented upward or downward, this arrangement in the FIGS. is arbitrary and is not intended to suggest that invention should necessarily be in an upward or downward direction. Generally, the device can be operated in any orientation. The same numbers are used in the drawing FIGS. to relate to the same elements.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term “horizontal” as used herein is defined as a plane parallel to the conventional plane or surface of the invention, regardless of its orientation. The term “vertical” refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms, such as “on”, “above”, “below”, “bottom”, “top”, “side” (as in “sidewall”), “higher”, “lower”, “upper”, “over”, and “under”, are defined with respect to the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term “processing” as used herein includes deposition of material or photoresist, patterning, exposure, development, etching, cleaning, and/or removal of the material or photoresist as required in forming a described structure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a micro chip-scale-package system <b>100</b> in an embodiment of the present invention. The micro chip-scale-package system <b>100</b> includes an encapsulant <b>102</b>, having a bottom surface <b>104</b>. The encapsulant <b>102</b> is applied over an integrated circuit die <b>106</b>, having a non-active surface <b>108</b> and an active surface <b>110</b>. The active surface <b>110</b> of the integrated circuit die <b>106</b> includes a bond surface <b>112</b> for an electrical interconnection <b>114</b>. The non-active surface <b>108</b> of the integrated circuit die <b>106</b> is attached to a film with a die attach material <b>116</b>, such as a die attach adhesive. A metal pattern <b>118</b> includes a contact surface <b>120</b> as well as signal I/O pins <b>122</b>. The electrical interconnection <b>114</b> connects the bond surface <b>112</b> of the active surface <b>110</b> to the contact surface <b>120</b> providing electrical connectivity between the integrated circuit die <b>106</b> and the metal pattern <b>118</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0048">An aspect is that the present invention allows the package to be of a smaller size. The thinness of the film or substrate as well as its removal to expose the package pins provides a significantly smaller form factor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">It has been discovered that the disclosed structure provides a more reliable packaged device. The elimination of a solder mask and the substrate provide improved adhesion for the mold compound or encapsulant.</p>
