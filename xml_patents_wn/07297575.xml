<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a system semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same, and in particular, to a system semiconductor device having a plurality of functional blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The conventional system LSI (Large-Scale-Integrated circuit) generally includes a plurality of functional blocks. Herein, it is to be noted that the functional block serves as a circuit unit for realizing a specific function. In such a system LSI, complex functions are integrated on one chip.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional method of manufacturing the system LSI has been carried out as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A plurality of functional blocks are first fabricated on a silicon chip. Thereafter, a circuit wiring layer which electrically connects the functional blocks to each other is formed on the silicon chip by the use of a metal vaporizing method or a metal plating method.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Subsequently, an insulating film is formed thereon and the circuit wiring layer and the insulating layer are sequentially laminated. Thereby, a global wiring layer serving as a multi-wiring layer is formed on the silicon chip.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, a plurality of circuit wiring layers and insulating layers conventionally has been laminated for many times to manufacture the system LSI.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the conventional system LSI has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">First, manufacturing yield is degraded. This reason will be explained below. Namely, an external stress is applied or stress-migration occurs because a plurality of circuit wiring layers and insulating layers are laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Under this circumstance, the circuit wiring layer is peeled from the insulating layer. Consequently, a physical strength is inevitably lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, an electrical connection between layers is damaged. In consequence, electrical connection reliability is readily degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Second, a manufacturing duration becomes long. This reason will be explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Namely, after the system LSI is fabricated, a plurality circuit wiring layers and insulating layers are alternately laminated on a system LSI cell. To this end, complex and many steps are inevitably required.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Third, selection degree of freedom concerning materials of the global wiring layer and manufacturing processes is lowered. This reason will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">That is, the manufacturing process of the global wiring layer or the materials of the circuit wiring layers and the insulating layers are restricted in dependency upon a laminating process. Consequently, the manufacturing process and the material can not freely or suitably selected.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Fourth, physical characteristics and electrical characteristics are degraded, and the manufacturing cost becomes high. This reason will be explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The manufacturing process of the global wiring line layer or the materials of the circuit wiring layers and the insulating layers are restricted in accordance with the laminating process. Consequently, the manufacturing process and the material can not freely or suitably selected.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Fifth, the electrical characteristic for a high-frequency signal is degraded. This reason will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">That is, a system LSI cell portion and the global wiring line layer are adjacently arranged to each other. In consequence, dielectric constants are enhanced to each other, and impedance of the circuit is also increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a system semiconductor device which has a simple manufacturing step and a cheap manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is another object of this invention to provide a system semiconductor device which is capable of improving physical and electrical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this invention, a system semiconductor device has a system LSI cell portion and a global wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The system LSI cell portion includes a plurality of functional blocks for realizing specific functions. In this event, each of the functional blocks serves as a unit circuit and is arranged on a semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A global wiring layer has a wiring layer on a semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With this structure, the system LSI cell portion is laminated or combined with the global wiring layer such that the functional blocks are electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this case, a plurality of the system LSI cell portions are formed on a semiconductor wafer while a plurality of the global wiring layers are formed on the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this condition, the semiconductor wafer and the semiconductor substrate are laminated, diced and separated to obtain a plurality of the system semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The global wiring layer includes a first wiring layer formed on the semiconductor substrate, an insulating layer formed on the first wiring layer, and a second wiring layer and an adhesive layer formed on the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively, the global wiring layer may include a first wiring layer formed on an organic substrate, an insulating layer formed on the first wiring layer, and a second wiring layer and an adhesive layer formed on the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Instead, the global wiring layer may have a first wiring layer formed on the semiconductor substrate, an insulating layer formed on the first wiring layer, a second wiring layer formed on the insulating layer, and inner bumps formed on the second wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternatively, the global wiring layer may comprise a first wiring layer formed on an organic substrate, an insulating layer formed on the first wiring layer, a second wiring layer formed on the insulating layer, and inner bumps formed on the second wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this case, the insulating layer preferably includes a via which electrically connects the first wiring layer with the second wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The global wiring layer may have bumps for electrically connecting to an external circuit on a surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, the global wiring layer may include buried vias which electrically connect the functional blocks to an external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Moreover, the global wiring layer may have at least one or more of the wiring layers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, the global wiring layer may have at least one or more of the insulating layers.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, description will be made about a system LSI according to a first embodiment of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A system LSI illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is formed by laminating or combining a system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> with a global wiring layer <b>8</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> on the condition that the global wiring layer is turned over.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this case, the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> has functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. While, the global wiring layer <b>8</b> mutually and electrically connects the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> formed on the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> is composed of a silicon chip <b>1</b>, and the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> formed on the surface of the silicon chip <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this case, the silicon chip <b>1</b> is formed by processing and separating a variety of semiconductor wafers such as a silicon wafer by a dicing process. Although the silicon chip <b>1</b> is realized by the silicon, the other arbitrary semiconductor materials may be used instead of the silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, each of the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> serves as an unit circuit which realizes a specific function as a memory or a microcomputer, and is fabricated by performing a patterning process, an ion implanting process, and a stepper processing process for each part of the silicon chip <b>1</b>, and has pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>serving as electrodes on the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The global wiring layer <b>8</b> is composed of a silicon substrate <b>11</b>, buried vias <b>12</b>, a first wiring layer <b>13</b>, an insulating layer <b>14</b>, a second wiring layer <b>15</b>, and an adhesive layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With such a structure, the global wiring line layer <b>8</b> mutually and electrically connects the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> on the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b>, and is electrically coupled to an external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Herein, it is to be noted that the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is formed by processing and separating a variety of semiconductor wafers such as the silicon wafer by the use of the dicing process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The buried via <b>12</b> is formed by performing a buried process for an internal of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> to penetrate the internal of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, and is formed by conductive material which electrically connects the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> with the external circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this event, the buried via <b>12</b> is formed by the use of a selection CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method, a metal plating method or a conductive paste method.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first wiring layer <b>13</b> is deposited by shaping conductive material of a variety of metals such as copper to a specific pattern on the surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, and electrically connects the buried via with a via <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Herein, it is to be noted that the metal film serving as the first wiring layer <b>13</b> is formed by the use of the plating method or the sputtering method.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The insulating layer <b>14</b> is formed by depositing insulating material on the surface of the first wiring layer <b>13</b>, and electrically insulates the first wiring layer <b>13</b> from the second wiring layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this case, silicon compound of SiOx or SiNx, organic material, such as, polyimide and compound fluoride may be used as the insulating material of the insulating layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The via <b>14</b>, which electrically connects the first wiring layer <b>13</b> with the second wiring layer <b>15</b>, is formed at a specific position of the insulating film <b>14</b> by the use of the selective CVD method, the metal plating method or the conductive paste method. Herein, copper or copper alloy may be used as the material of the via <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second wiring layer <b>15</b> is deposited by shaping conductive material of a variety of metals to a specific pattern on the surface of the insulating layer <b>14</b>, and electrically connects the via <b>14</b><i>a </i>with electrodes <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> of the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Herein, it is to be noted that the metal film serving as the second wiring layer <b>15</b> is formed by the use of the plating method or the sputtering method.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The adhesive layer <b>16</b> is formed by a variety of adhesive materials, such as, heat-hardening resin or light-hardening resin, and is formed on the surface of the second insulating layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although the first and second wiring layers <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> of the global wiring layer <b>8</b> are formed by Al, Al alloy, Cu, and Cu alloy, arbitrary conductive materials may be used other than them.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Similarly, although the insulating layer <b>14</b> is formed by a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and polyimide, optional material may be used other than them.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Likely, the buried via <b>12</b> and the via <b>14</b><i>a </i>are formed by burying the conductive metal for internal surface of the buried via <b>12</b> and the via <b>14</b><i>a </i>by the use of the selective CVD method or by plating the conductive metal, such as, Cu.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Alternatively, the buried via <b>12</b> and the via <b>14</b><i>a </i>may be formed by filling and hardening the conductive paste mixed with metal powder inside the buried via <b>12</b> and the via <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Instead, they may be formed by using an arbitrary method by the use of an optional conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Subsequently, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4C</figref>, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> of the system LSI <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">First, the silicon chip <b>1</b> is prepared by dicing and separating a silicon wafer, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, the pattern forming process, the ion injection process and the stepper process are carried out for the silicon chip <b>1</b> to form the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> on the silicon chip <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Herein, the respective gates in the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> are connected to each other by the use of polysilicon or a aluminum wiring pattern which is used in the general structure of the LSI wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Subsequently, external terminals are formed to connect between the respective functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b>. To this end, pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>are formed at specific portions on the surface of the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In this event, the connection net number between the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> of the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>is largely low in comparison with the connection net number in the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b>. Consequently, the number of the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>may be not much high.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Therefore, if each of the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>has a size of 10 μm and a space (pitch) of 12 μm between the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a</i>, the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>can be formed with such number that enough connection is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Meanwhile, it is to be noted that each of the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>may be formed by the use of metal film, such as, copper, gold, gold tin solder, tin lead solder. Thus, the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5F</figref>, description will be made about the global wiring layer <b>8</b> of the system LSI <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">First, the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is prepared, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, the buried vias <b>12</b> are formed inside the silicon substrate <b>11</b> by the use of the selective CVD method or the metal plating method, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Successively, the conductive material, such as, Cu is deposited on the surface of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>, and the first wiring layer <b>13</b> is formed by a patterning process after an exposing and developing process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Subsequently, the insulating film <b>14</b> is deposited on the surface of the first wiring layer <b>13</b>. Thereafter, the vias <b>14</b> are formed at specific portions in the insulating layer <b>14</b> so as to penetrate the insulating layer <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. Thereby, the via <b>14</b><i>a </i>electrically mutually connects the first wiring layer <b>13</b> with the second wiring layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, the conductive material, such as, Cu and Au is deposited on the surface of the insulating layer <b>14</b> and the vias <b>14</b><i>a </i>by the sputtering method or the plating method, and the second wiring layer <b>15</b> is formed by the patterning process after the exposing and developing process, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Finally, heat-hardening adhesives are supplied to a region except for a region where the second wiring layer <b>15</b> is formed on the surface of the global wiring layer <b>8</b> to form the adhesive layer <b>16</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>. Thus, the global wiring layer <b>8</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the first embodiment, the following process rule may be, for example, adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Namely, a line width is equal 10 μm, and a wiring space is equal to 10 μm. Further, a conductor thickness of the first and second wiring layer <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> is equal to 10 μm while an insulating thickness of the insulating layer <b>14</b> is equal to 10 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus, the global wiring layer <b>8</b> can be formed by the use of a relatively rough process rule in the first embodiment. Consequently, only the global wiring layer <b>8</b> can be independently manufactured by using cheaper equipment than a mounting equipment for forming the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although the first and second wiring layers <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> and the insulating layer <b>14</b> are used as the global wiring layer, the layer number of these wiring layers and the insulating layer is not restricted, and a single layer or a multiple layer may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6C</figref>, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The global wiring layer <b>8</b> is transferred onto the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. In this event, the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> is mounted on a stage (not shown) while the global wiring layer <b>8</b> is transferred on the condition that the global wiring layer <b>8</b> is turned over.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Under this circumstance, the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> are positioned in opposition to the second wiring layer <b>15</b> of the global wiring layer <b>8</b> by using a position detecting device, such as, an image camera.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, the LSI cell portion <b>7</b> and the global wiring layer are overlapped to each other. In the condition, a pressure is applied upwards and downward, and a heating process is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Thereby, the adhesive layer <b>16</b> is heat-hardened, and the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> and the global wiring layer <b>8</b> are bonded and hardened. Consequently, the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> are coupled with the second wiring layer <b>15</b> of the global wiring layer <b>8</b>, and are mutually and electrically connected, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Finally, the silicon substrate <b>11</b> is polished from an upper side of the global wiring layer <b>8</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Thereby, the buried vias <b>12</b> are exposed on the surface, and serves as the electrodes for the external circuit. Thus, the system LSI <b>10</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Thus, after the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> and the global wiring layer <b>8</b> are independently manufactured, and they are laminated or combined to form the system LSI <b>10</b>, in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">After the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> and the global wiring layer <b>8</b> are laminated or combined to each other, the buried vias <b>12</b> are exposed to the surface in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Alternatively, after the buried vias <b>12</b> are exposed to the surface before the laminating or combining step, the system LSI may be manufactured by laminating or combining them.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, description will be made about a system LSI according to a second embodiment of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The system LSI <b>10</b> according to the second embodiment has a substantially similar structure with the system LSI according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">However, the second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that an organic substrate is used instead of the silicon substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Herein, it is to be noted that organic material, such as, epoxy resin and polyimide, is used as a base member. As the organic substrate, a flexible substrate having a relatively thin thickness and flexibility is suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Subsequently, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI <b>10</b> according to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8E</figref>, description will be made about a method of manufacturing a global wiring layer <b>8</b> of the system LSI <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A plurality of second wiring layers <b>20</b><i>a </i>are laminated by the use of the known forming method of the multiple wiring pattern to form the second wiring layer <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Successively, the global wiring layer <b>8</b> is manufactured in the same manner as the steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5E</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B through 8E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9C</figref>, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI <b>10</b> according to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b>, the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> are formed on the surface of the silicon chip <b>1</b> in the same steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The global wiring layer <b>8</b> is transferred onto the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In this event, the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> is mounted on a stage (not shown) while the global wiring layer <b>8</b> is transferred on the condition that the global wiring layer <b>8</b> is turned over.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Under this circumstance, the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> are positioned in opposition to the wiring layer <b>15</b> of the global wiring layer <b>8</b> by using a position detecting device, such as, an image camera.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Next, the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> and the global wiring layer are overlapped to each other. In the condition, a pressure is applied upwards and downward, and a heating process is carried out, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Thereby, the adhesive layer <b>16</b> is heat-hardened, and the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> and the global wiring layer <b>8</b> are bonded and hardened. Consequently, the pads <b>2</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the system LSI cell portion <b>7</b> are coupled with the second wiring layer <b>15</b> of the global wiring layer <b>8</b>, and are mutually and electrically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Finally, solder balls are supplied on the surface of the second wiring layer <b>20</b><i>a </i>exposed at an upper side of the global wiring layer <b>8</b>, and are welded to for bumps <b>26</b>. Thereby, the system LSI <b>10</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Thus, as the material of the global wiring layer <b>8</b>, the organic substrate formed by the organic material is used instead of the silicon substrate <b>11</b> as the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b> of the first embodiment in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Thereby, the second wiring layer <b>20</b>, which electrically connects the functional blocks <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> with the bumps <b>26</b>, is integrally formed with the global wiring layer <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In consequence, the physical strength is enhanced, and the electrical connection reliability is also enhanced. Further, a technique, which has a low cost and is generally utilized for the organic wiring substrate, is applicable.</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">After the silicon wafer <b>101</b> and the silicon substrate <b>101</b> are laminated, the silicon wafer <b>101</b> and the silicon substrate <b>111</b> are integrated and diced to separate the respective system LSIs, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">According to this invention, the manufacturing yield can be enhanced. This reason will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Namely, after the system LSI cell portion having the functional blocks and the global wiring layer can be independently manufactured the system LSI can be readily fabricated only by laminating or combining them.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Moreover, the selective degree of freedom can be enhanced with respect to the manufacturing process and the material of the global wiring layer. This is because the global wiring layer can be independently manufactured and the mounting equipment becomes cheaper.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Further, the physical characteristics and the electrical characteristics are improved, and the manufacturing cost can be reduced. This is because a selective range of the manufacturing process and the material of the global wiring layer can be widened.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In addition, the electrical characteristics for the high-frequency signal can be improved. The reason will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Namely, the functional block is laminated with the global wiring layer by the use of the bump. Thereby, the space is formed between the functional block and the global wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Consequently, the dielectric constant is reduced, and the high-frequency characteristic is improved. Further, an unnecessary electrical coupling is weakened.</p>
