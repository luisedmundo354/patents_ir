<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to communications services and, more particularly, to collaboration services.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Instant messaging systems allow users in a group to see whether members of the group are logged on to the messaging system, and allow users to chat with each other using a text-based system. Collaborative tools such as NetMeeting, similarly, allow users to see who is currently active in the system and allow the users to join a conference and share documents. Email and voice mail systems allow users to send pointers to documents and attach messages in the form of text and/or voice.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, users are forced to choose between synchronous communication and asynchronous communication. Synchronous communication (e.g., phone calls, chat and the like) requires the other users to be present at the same time and is intrusive in nature because a caller or a chat session participant interrupts the other users with a request to communicate immediately. Asynchronous communication allows users to respond at their leisure, but introduces delay and is narrow in bandwidth. Commonly, users send email messages to other users and ask them to phone them back in an attempt at establishing a polite request for communication. Besides being cumbersome, this approach has two major difficulties; (a) there is no indication as to the availability of the originator (if the email is read hours later, is the originator still at work?), and (b) the responder pays for the phone call, not the person who requested the call.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Problems and limitations of prior known collaborative arrangements are addressed by employing a so-called “ConnectIcon™” View. Specifically, a ConnectIcon View is a dynamic visual representation of the participants of a group being invited to communicate together with their presence information, lists of documents and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to be examined, and a set of mechanisms (email, chat, voice, and the like) to initiate communication, each of which can be billed to the originator or otherwise as desired. The available presence information allows a user to employ the best mode of communicating for the instant purpose, namely, either asynchronous communication or synchronous communication.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a specific embodiment, a ConnectIcon View includes two entities, for example, a virtual ConnectIcon View and a real ConnectIcon View. The virtual ConnectIcon View is a set of descriptive data existing on a database. The data includes participants, an originator, a message, document locations and descriptions, and a set of different access mechanisms. This data is created by the originator using a GUI (graphic user interface) and stored in a database on a server. This server also stores presence information collected from devices registered by participants, i.e., users, of a group, so that the individual user's presence information and availability can be determined. For example, when a user starts a so-called ConnectIcon Viewer Applet, it connects to a database via a User Agent and reads in any stored ConnectIcon Views that involve the particular user. These ConnectIcon Views are shown on a monitor screen as a “real” ConnectIcon View. For each “real” ConnectIcon View, the presence information for each involved user is automatically collected and dynamically updated, and menu items allow users to delete themselves from the ConnectIcon View, observe associated documents and initiate either asynchronous or synchronous communication as limited by the mechanism specified in the ConnectIcon View.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, in simplified form, details of a communications network in which the invention may be advantageously employed. The network supports connectivity to public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>101</b> end offices for SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Soft Endpoint to PSTN calls and the like. In this example, the network includes application server/media server <b>102</b> including an embodiment of the invention, softswitch programmable feature server (SPFS) <b>103</b> that inter-work with PSTN <b>101</b> through a Media Gateway <b>104</b>, which converts between internet protocol (IP) and PSTN <b>101</b> formats. The Media Gateway <b>104</b> supports SS7 trunks to the PSTN End Offices, which can be the Lucent 7R/E Now switch or other vendor switches. The SS7 trunks may be E1 trunks for international applications or T1 trunks for NAR (North American Region) deployment. The Media Gateway <b>104</b> supports voice over IP (VOIP) calls originating from remote places and entering via modems. Inter-working with the access network <b>105</b> is through an IP service switch <b>106</b>, such as the Spring Tide 5000. IP service switch <b>106</b> provides network-based firewall service, user identification and authorization and provides a platform for usage-based billing, dynamic virtual private network (VPN), tiered service selection and customer network management. Access network <b>105</b> interfaces to enterprise soft endpoints via router <b>107</b>. Additionally, access network <b>105</b> interfaces soft endpoints with digital subscriber line (DSL) modems via Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) <b>108</b> and to soft endpoints with cable modems via cable modem termination system (CMTS) <b>109</b>. Inter-working between PSTN <b>101</b> and access network <b>105</b> is via (Remote Access Server) <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The collaboration services, in accordance with the invention, are implemented utilizing Application and Media Servers <b>102</b> supported through the Softswitch Programmable Feature Server (SPFS). The SPFS is a programmable converged voice and data services platform for packet networks. In this example, it is based on the so-called Softswitch commercially available from Lucent Technologies Inc. The SPFS provides a service logic execution environment (SLEE) for service sessions, multimedia voice/video/data services, converged telephony/internet services, enhancements to “full circle” applications programming interface (API), and rapid service authoring and deployment by service providers or third parties. The SPFS services are provided to intelligent soft endpoints utilizing multimedia enabled protocols, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and H.323, and a WEB server interface to services.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The SPFS incorporates a services framework on the Softswitch base enabling services blending and the deployment of services in a generic and extensible fashion. The canonical call model, device servers, and SPFS service framework together enable the SPFS core service logic to be “access and transport neutral,” and to inter-work calls among clients communicating with diverse protocols. The features of the SPFS required for the collaboratory services are

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Any Service Logic Execution Environment (SLEE) capable of supporting these two features (e.g., Lucent Technologies' PacketIN) via any well known protocol (JTAPI, Pints/Spirits, SIP) can be substituted for the SPFS.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">The principal network components enabling the converged collaboratory services, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes the following components:</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Residing on the user's personal computer <b>207</b> are the following:</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0029">The SPFS Service Framework <b>201</b> is the architectural model enabling services blending and the deployment of services in a generic and extensible fashion. The Service Framework <b>201</b> architecture leverages object-oriented mechanisms to maximize independence in deploying new services. The service framework <b>201</b> is a Service Logic Execution Environment that is responsible for responding to requests for service and initializing connections between endpoints. The SPFS SLEE is implemented as a set of Java classes running in a Java Virtual Machine.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">The User Agent <b>203</b> provides a point of contact between the intelligent endpoint and the service provider. It provides a WEB interface to an end user's browser, performs authentication, and initiates the service chosen by the end user, based on personalized preferences of the user. The User Agent is implemented as a set of Java servlets running on a WEB Server, of which the Authentication servlet <b>204</b> is shown as an example. As described below regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the service framework <b>201</b> interfaces with the Lucent Softswitch (LSS) <b>213</b> over JTAPI (Java Telephony API) <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">Not shown in this diagram is an optional application that detects user presence activity on the Soft Endpoint. For a personal computer (PC), these are keystrokes and mouse events. Messages are sent from the application to the User Agent <b>203</b> when moving from idle to using the keyboard/mouse, or when there has been no activity for a user configurable time period (e.g., approximately 5 minutes). Other events that may be employed to indicate participant presence or not are, for example, logging on or off a system or service, timing out, i.e., no activity on the system or service for a prescribed interval, telephone on-hook or off-hook indication, a wireless connection or disconnect, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates, in simplified block diagram form, details of a system architecture employed in practicing an embodiment of the invention. Specifically, shown is the SPFS service frame work <b>201</b>, DC-MeetingServer <b>210</b>, with its own published API <b>209</b>, user agent <b>203</b>, Lucent Softswitch <b>213</b> with associated JTAPI interface <b>212</b>, lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) database <b>206</b>, DC-client applications unit <b>216</b>, TeamPortal View <b>214</b>, ConnectIcon View <b>215</b>, and OpenChannel View <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">The SPSF <b>201</b>, described above, is the Service Logic Execution Environment (SLEE) used in this implementation to set up calls and report on phone endpoint activity. Following is the list of the functionality required of the SPFS <b>201</b>:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0034">All conference call requests will be routed. It makes the connections between DC-MeetingServer <b>210</b> and LSS <b>213</b> by calling the Meeting server's API <b>209</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0035">Constantly monitors (via JTAPI <b>212</b>) the phone numbers registered with the system and sends all the useful events to user agent <b>203</b>, which will update the LDAP database <b>206</b>;</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">The DC-MeetingServer <b>210</b> is a commercial application which bridges calls so as to provide conferencing services including Chat session, Application sharing, Whiteboard and video conferencing services. DC-MeetingServer <b>210</b> is a packaged conference/collaboration server solution. DC-MeetingServer <b>210</b> provides core data conferencing capabilities for standard T.120, H.323 conferencing clients such as Microsoft's NetMeeting, Sun Microsystems' SunForum, etc. As a server-based solution, DC-MeetingServer <b>210</b> provides support for firewall protection, multi-party audio and video, centralized administration and diagnostics, security, and billing services.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">The SPFS <b>201</b> uses the DCL published API <b>209</b> to set up and monitor conference calls. Also, approximately every one minute, it retrieves a list of all users who have participated in a conference in that minute period. It also retrieves a list of users who spoke on a conference in that period.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">User Agent <b>203</b> is central to the provision of collaborative services. User Agent <b>203</b> is responsible for maintaining presence data, i.e., information, for the registered clients. It maintains lists of subscribers and notifies subscribers of changes in status. The User Agent <b>203</b> maintains a LDAP database <b>206</b> in which presence information is maintained for each individual registered with the system. It also supports Presence Clients that register with it. These clients include TeamPortal View <b>214</b>, ConnectIcon View <b>215</b>, and OpenChannel View <b>217</b>. Presence Clients are Java classes that run remotely and can both report changes in presence status and react to User Agent messages telling them that the Presence information has changed for a user they have defined as being in their awareness set.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">Briefly, the User Agent <b>203</b> is a WEB interface to a database that stores information, i.e., presence information, on users that describes where and how the users are present in the network. This information can be used to indicate availability and the best way to contact, i.e., the best mode of communicating with, a user. Access to presence information is restricted based on user preferences that are stored in the User Agent <b>203</b>. The User Agent <b>203</b> uses a LDAP database <b>206</b> to store the data, but direct access to the database is not necessary. Servlets in the User Agent <b>203</b> are used to request that presence data be created or changed and to request data or subscribe to presence data (a subscription to presence data means that the subscriber is notified when that data changes).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">The user agent <b>203</b> includes a WEB server (with associated servlet engine) with a number of servlets that process HTTP requests. These servlets implement requests to set up connections (e.g. phone calls and conference calls), get data from a calendaring application, get information from LDAP database <b>206</b> and set information in the LDAP database <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">The Lucent Softswitch <b>213</b> provides services to softphones with session initiation protocol (SIP) and H.323 clients, which perform service signaling for the SPFS through a packet access network. Calls among the softphone users route through the packet network. Calls between SIP and H.323 clients are inter-worked through the Lucent Softswitch (LSS) SIP device server and H.323 device server. Calls set up between a softphone and a phone on a PSTN (Public Switched Telephony Network) <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) end office use SS7 signaling through the Lucent Softswitch SS7 Device Server, with bearer traffic flowing through a media gateway to SS7 trunks to the PSTN <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The SPFS interfaces to the Lucent Softswitch using the JTAPI API <b>212</b></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">A presence client is a Java applet that is run within a browser and provides an interface to presence and connectivity information. It continuously updates to reflect the current state of the presence data retrieved from the User Agent <b>203</b> (and thence from LDAP database <b>206</b>) and enables users to make connection requests. TeamPortal View <b>214</b> includes a set of these presence clients. All requests and data are accessed through the User Agent <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">TeamPortal View <b>214</b> is a set of three presence clients that shows information for a single team. It shows information on each member of the team, namely:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0045">(a) The current dates and times at the team geographic locations;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0046">(b) The holidays and team member plans obtained from a team calendaring application; and</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0047">(c) Member contact information and current presence status.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">TeamPortal View <b>214</b> is designed, as a set of Java applets that work together, but are not required all to be present. It provides GUI features for click-to-dial, -to-email, -to-conference and see calendars, personal pages, etc. Each of these features is implemented by calls to the User Agent <b>203</b>. Specifically, a TeamPortal View <b>214</b> is a dynamic visual representation of the members of a team whose members are located at geographically distributed locations. The TeamPortal View <b>214</b> provides a Web portal that (a) displays static team information, (b) provides a dynamic view of the team members presence and their current locations, which are collected automatically and up-dated in real-time and (c) enables contact to be mad by members of the team using the Web interface to initiate email, chat sessions, person-to-person calls conference calls or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">A ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> is a virtual entity stating one user's desire to connect to one or more other users. The ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> data is stored in the User Agent <b>203</b> LDAP database <b>206</b> and is made visible in the user's browser in a ConnectIcon View <b>215</b>. This provides a representation of each other participant's presence status and enables the participants receiving the data to contact each other via clicking. A user configures and sends a ConnectIcon View using servlets of the User Agent <b>203</b>. ConnectIcon Views may include pointers to documents, notes, calendars and connection processes such as chat, voice, conference and application sharing. Specifically, a ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> is a dynamic visual representation of the participants of a group being invited to communicate together with their presence information, lists of documents and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to be examined, and a set of mechanisms (email, chat, voice, and the like) to initiate communication, each of which can be billed to the originator. The available presence information enables a user to employ the best mode of communicating for the instant purpose, namely, either asynchronous communication or synchronous</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">An OpenChannel View <b>217</b> provides a visual process for monitoring the status of a conference call. It indicates which participant is active and/or speaking, which participant has been active and/or speaking recently and enables the participants to change their level of participation between full (listen and speak), listen only (no speaking) and monitoring (just the visual indication). It provides the facility to have a long-term virtual conference which consumes no resources, but which participants may monitor and see if any of the other participants has become active on. It also enables participants to replay sections of a conference. Specifically, the OpenChannel View <b>217</b> separates the logical state of a conference call from the actual connectedness of the participants. That is, OpenChannel View <b>217</b> separates participants of a conference call that are not active from those participants that are currently active in the conference call. This establishes a type of virtual conference, i.e., meeting, that can be monitored by participants without requiring them to be actively a part of the conference call. These participants are in a so-called monitor mode, and can readily change their state from the monitor mode to a listen mode or active mode, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows in simplified form a network architecture, a so-called services incubator, employed in an embodiment of the invention.

<p id="p-0044" num="0058">The distributed system provides scalability, portability, and capacity. It enables resource sharing and legacy system reuse. Each component in the system could be on a different platform. The component allocation is transparent (i.e., not visible) to an end-user. In other words, the end user of a distributed system is not aware that there are multiple processes and/or platforms in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0059">The user agent <b>203</b> is a WEB server (with associated servlet engine) with a number of servlets that process http requests.

Presence Clients
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0109">The presence clients are Java applets that can be run in any WEB browser. Each applet may work independently of the others, but if present in the same virtual machine (typically, in the same browser) they interact with each other so that (for example) clicking on person's presence information should show their current calendar plans and the time at their current location. Presence clients only interaction with the rest of the system is to make requests of the User Agent. These requests are HTTP requests to servlets that either gather information from the User Agent and user database or request a connection between parties.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0110">The Presence Clients are not responsible for managing any communication, such as conference calls or application sharing. Their only function is to request that such a communication be set up (such a request goes to the User Agent <b>203</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0111">The term User Agent <b>203</b> is used to describe the set of servlets running on a WEB server (in this implementation, this is the Apache Tomcat Server <b>304</b>) with which the Presence Client Applets communicate. These servlets are the means by which data is stored in the Presence Database, i.e., LDAP database <b>206</b>, and retrieved from the LDAP database <b>206</b>. Processes for calling servlets from Java applets or applications and reading data from them into local storage are well know in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0112">Most of these servlets use the standard Java JNDI (Java Network Driver Interface) classes (available from Sun Microsystems) to access the LDAP database <b>206</b>. In this example implementation, we use the OpenLDAP database, (available from the OpenLDAP foundation).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0113">To store or update data in the LDAP database <b>206</b>, the following steps must be performed:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0117">The ‘Login’ servlet looks in the LDAP database <b>206</b> for the existence of the stated user with the stated password. If such a record exists, it places the user's name into the servlet session object (a well-known technique described, for example, in “Java Servlets” by Karl Moss, published by McGraw-Hill). It returns the text string “success” if the user has been validated and “failure” otherwise.</p>

Thus, the LDAP database <b>206</b> is made available to any software process that can connect to it over the WEB. These servlets are standard servlets written to create a database connection to a local database system. In this example implementation, we have used the Sun Microsystems JNDI database connection API to connect to a standard LDAP database <b>206</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0037-0002" num="0184">Software functions are added to a multiplicity of “devices” that report on device functionality. A “device” in this sense is a physical device such as a computer, phone, or PDA or a virtual device such as an email mailbox or a WEB portal such as TeamPortal View <b>214</b>. All that is required for such a device to be used in the system is that some functionality is added so that the device can report when it is being used. In this example implementation we support the following devices:
        <ul id="ul0038" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0038-0001" num="0185">TeamPortal View <b>214</b>. When a user logs in to the system, that event is reported to the database</li>
            <li id="ul0038-0002" num="0186">Telephones. A user registers any number of his telephones with the Service Framework <b>201</b> that, in turn, uses an API such as JTAPI (Java Telephony API) to register interest in events related to that telephone on the Telephone Switch <b>213</b>. This registration is described in standard JTAPI documentation. When the registered telephone is used, the Telephone Switch notifies the Service Framework which reports the event to the LDAP database <b>206</b>.</li>
            <li id="ul0038-0003" num="0187">Personal Computers. The user installs a modified screen saver application <b>433</b> on the computer <b>432</b> which, instead of dimming the screen and brightening it as the computer is left idle or used, reports the usage information to the LDAP database <b>206</b>.</li>

        <li id="ul0040-0001" num="0189">1) Email one or more people. This is achieved using standard Java Applet functionality.</li>
        <li id="ul0040-0002" num="0190">2) Create a telephone call or conference and modify a conference by adding or dropping people. This is achieved by making such a request to a WEB server servlet which forwards the request to the appropriate processes of the Service Framework <b>201</b>, which makes the request of the telephone Switch <b>213</b> (using JTAPI <b>212</b>) and/or a commercial Conference Server (using the Conference Server's proprietary API).</li>
        <li id="ul0040-0003" num="0191">3) Chat to one or more people. The chat employed is known in the art as ‘persistent chat’ that is an enhancement of instant messaging style chat sessions so that chat messages are stored on the WEB server. This has the advantage that users can be sent messages when they are not logged in and they can view them at a later time when they do log in. This feature is very importance for teams separated by several time zones.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0192">The Service Framework <b>201</b> is software that manages the interface to the telephone switch and the commercial conference server. In this example implementation, it uses JTAPI <b>205</b> to interface to the switch and RMI (Java remote process invocation) to talk to the WEB server servlets of the User Agent <b>203</b>. When the appropriate process is called (via RMI) from a servlet it requests a telephone call from the Telephone switch <b>213</b> or a conference call from the Conference Server <b>210</b> (via the conference server's proprietary API <b>209</b>). When it receives events from either the Conference Server <b>210</b> or the Telephone Switch <b>213</b>, it calls the LDAP database <b>206</b> and stores the event there in the appropriate device record <b>402</b> of the correct entry in the user table <b>437</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the flow of events that cause a user's presence data to be updated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <b>501</b> represents a telephone connected to a telephone switch <b>213</b>. A phone endpoint listener <b>502</b> (a publically available part of JTAPI), running on that switch, reports events associated with that phone to the service framework using JTAPI <b>212</b> in our implementation. Other device <b>503</b> represents any device that can be used by a person on which a listener <b>504</b> can be installed that reports information on presence to the database <b>206</b> via the User Agent <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0194">As an example, the following is a sample process when a registered telephone is used:
<ul id="ul0041" list-style="none">

        <li id="ul0042-0002" num="0196">The Telephone switch <b>213</b> sends a JTAPI event to the service framework <b>201</b> stating that the phone is in use;</li>
        <li id="ul0042-0003" num="0197">The Service Framework passes that information, with an added timestamp, to the User Agent <b>203</b> which matches the device to a user <b>437</b> and stores the time-stamped message in the correct device attribute <b>402</b> for that user.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0198">A similar path is followed when the phone call terminates and when other devices are used.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0199">The Presence Clients need to be able to read data from this database and to have their data refreshed when new data becomes available on the database. This is implemented by a Loader object <b>416</b> that Loads the data and a Monitor object <b>422</b> that regularly polls the server to see if new data needs to be loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0200">There is one Loader object for all Presence Clients running in a single browser (or Java Virtual Machine) in this implementation. When each Presence Client (also termed ‘View’ in this section) is instantiated it must first check to see if a Loader exists and create it if it does not. The Loader's main functionality is to serve up Tables of data (a table is an implementation of a database record. In this example implementation, it is essentially a Vector or Columns, where each Column is an array of java.lang.Object). Thus, a call to Loader.getTable(“locations”) will get the table of people from a static file in this example implementation, whereas Loader.getTable(“groups”) will call a servlet of the WEB server and ask for all groups that the user belongs to. The following tables are the same for all users:
<ul id="ul0043" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0043-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0044" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0044-0001" num="0201">Locations <b>424</b></li>
        <li id="ul0044-0002" num="0202">Holidays <b>425</b>.
<br/>
And the others are dependent on he currently logged-in user, and will be returned as empty if no user is logged in. Specifically,
</li>
        <li id="ul0044-0003" num="0203">Loader.getTable(“groups”)—returns all groups <b>427</b> a user belongs to,</li>
        <li id="ul0044-0004" num="0204">Loader.getTable(“plans”)—returns all plans <b>426</b> for people in the user's currently selected group,</li>
        <li id="ul0044-0005" num="0205">Loader.getTable(“people”)—returns all people <b>428</b> in the user's currently selected group,</li>
        <li id="ul0044-0006" num="0206">Loader.getTable(“presence”)—returns presence information <b>429</b> for all people in the user's currently selected group and all people who are part of the user's set of ConnectIcon Views,</li>
        <li id="ul0044-0007" num="0207">Loader.getTable(“ConnectIcon Views”)—returns all ConnectIcon Views <b>430</b> the user has sent or received and not deleted,</li>
        <li id="ul0044-0008" num="0208">Loader.getTable(“OpenChannels”) returns all OpenChannel conferences <b>431</b> the user is a member of.
<br/>
Initially, no user is logged in and the current group is at a null. When a user logs in, the data is refreshed and the current group is set to the first one returned by Loader.getTable(“groups”). The user can change group using a call to the Loader <b>416</b> and that will also refresh the relevant data tables.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0209">The Monitor object <b>422</b> is a Java Thread that runs continuously and updates data using the Loader. It both updates the presence tables <b>429</b>, ConnectIcon View <b>430</b> and OpenChannel View <b>431</b> data at regular, user-defined intervals (typically every 10 seconds) and also updates the times displayed in the TimesView every minute to match the correct timezone-adjusted local time in each country.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows classes and indicates where each Table <b>423</b> in TeamPortal Objects <b>415</b> is retrieved from. The static tables of locations <b>602</b> and holidays <b>603</b> reside as simple text pages <b>601</b> available via the WEB or on the local file system.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0211">Each of the TeamPortal applets displays some of the data tables <b>423</b> in a WEB browser. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> indicates which views use which data and so must be redrawn when their data updates. This is a transitive graph, so that when (for example) presence data <b>429</b> changes, so does ConnectIcon View <b>430</b> data (which contains pointers to the presence data) and so both the PeopleView <b>419</b> and ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> must be redrawn.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0212">The TimesView <b>417</b> simply presents a scrolling list of locations, with the background color of each list item defined by the “locations” table and with text in each list item set equal to a catenation of the location name, country, and current time at that location. The latter is kept up to date by the monitor class <b>422</b> that reads the timezone information from “location” table <b>424</b> and access standard Java processes to get the date/time in that timezone. This scrolling list can be built on the ListView component of the standard Java Swing GUI component set.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0213">The CalendarView <b>418</b> displays a standard month-at-a-time wall-calendar layout for a pre-defined set of months. It superimposes graphic representations of two sets of Tables on this background:
<ul id="ul0045" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0045-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0046" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0046-0001" num="0214">Holidays <b>425</b>—the background of each day that is a holiday in a country found in the “locations” table is filled with the color associated with that location. Where more than one country have holidays on the same day, the space is divided amongst those countries;</li>
        <li id="ul0046-0002" num="0215">User Plans <b>426</b>—For each person in the “people” table, their plans are drawn as a series of linked dots in the corner of each day for which they have a plan noted. The color of the dots and lines is the same as that used to display the names in the PeopleView <b>419</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0216">When the user moves the mouse over a day, all holidays and plans falling on that day are superimposed on the view in a similar manner to the technique used in Microsoft's ToolTips concept. This is achieved by having the Java view define a Listener for the relevant Java MouseEvents and redrawing the view with the super-imposed text information when the mouse is over a critical part of the view.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0217">The PeopleView, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is another list view, which this time can have one or more columns, depending on user preferences. In this FIG., the people data <b>428</b> shows the details of each person's static information, namely their name <b>801</b>, preferred phone number <b>802</b>, email <b>803</b> and a unique ID for the person, <b>804</b>. The table of presence information <b>429</b> that is regularly updated, contains a set of devices for each person. Each set is linked into the people table <b>428</b> using the person_id attribute <b>812</b> to match the appropriate entry in the people table <b>428</b>. Each device record <b>813</b> contains a free-text device name <b>805</b>, a device type <b>806</b> which is one of a set of allowable devices (in our implementation this is one of “phone”, “PC”, “TeamPortal” View) a location <b>807</b> which is a text field which should be the same for all devices at a similar location, an identifer <b>808</b> that uniquely identifies the device given a user name or device type, a message <b>809</b> that is the last status message received from the device and a timestamp <b>810</b> which contains the time the last message was received.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0218">The display the user sees on the screen is labelled <b>419</b>. It is a Java List view with several columns. Each row <b>811</b> corresponds to information for exactly one person. All except one of the columns displayed in each row <b>811</b> show simple textual data mapped from the people table <b>428</b>. The last column, though, contains a depiction of Presence Data for each person in the table. As this is a complex object, it must be drawn with more care. Here is the technique used in this example implementation to draw each of rows <b>811</b>:
<ul id="ul0047" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0047-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0048" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0048-0001" num="0219">1) The unique id of the person whose data is at row i is read from the “people” table <b>428</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0048-0002" num="0220">2) That unique_id is used as a key to find the correct presence record in the “presence” table <b>429</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0048-0003" num="0221">3) Devices of the record are aggregated according to their location parameter <b>807</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0048-0004" num="0222">4) Each location is drawn in turn, with an icon (in this case a letter ‘W’, ‘O’, ‘H’, etc.) used to indicate which location <b>807</b> is being drawn. For each location, all the devices in the record with that location parameter are drawn.</li>
        <li id="ul0048-0005" num="0223">5) The type parameter <b>806</b> , which specifies what kind of device is being shown, is mapped to an icon representing that type of device. In this implementation, a type of ‘computer’ maps to ‘C’, ‘phone’ maps to ‘P’ and ‘teamportal’ maps to ‘M’.</li>
        <li id="ul0048-0006" num="0224">6) The color of the icon to be drawn is chosen to indicate both the message <b>809</b> and the age of the message (derived from the current time and the message timestamp <b>810</b>). In this implementation, the hue of the message codes whether it is a message indicating the device is ‘in use’ or ‘finished use’ and the darkness indicates the age. Thus a color of black indicates an old record, a bright green one indicates a ‘recent finished use’ message and a dull blue indicates ‘medium aged in use’ message.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p id="p-0098" num="0227">The ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> gives a list of views of individual ConnectIcon Views, and may be scrolled when the list is large. Each ConnectIcon View is drawn as follows:

The image is surrounded by a border <b>907</b> that encodes the presence data for that person. In this example implementation, the border is drawn with a color that encodes the most recent device information we have for that person using the same color system as in the PeopleView <b>419</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0050-0002" num="0229">2) Under the set of images, the message <b>901</b> of the ConnectIcon View is drawn as a caption <b>906</b>. The tooltips technique described above is used to show details on the presence data associated with each person, so that when the mouse <b>907</b> is moved over a person's image <b>905</b>, presence details <b>908</b> are drawn on the display. Clicking on a user's image invokes a menu allowing group or individual mail, conference calls or chat sessions to be initiated. Also any WEB documents associated with the ConnectIcon View are listed and may be loaded into the browser by selecting that option. Another menu option allows the ConnectIcon View to be deleted.</li>

<p id="p-0101" num="0243"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a frame of a browser running TeamPortal View <b>214</b> and the ConnectIcon View <b>215</b>. In globally distributed work, it is very difficult to know when your co-workers are available. They may live in many different time zones, and observe entirely different holidays. It can be very frustrating, after calling your colleague in Bangalore all day, to discover that it is Independence Day in India. In addition, it would be useful to know the current state of your colleagues' devices, i.e., if they've recently used their computer keyboards, or their office phones. Placing calls to the best device at any given moment with only a click makes voice contact far faster and more likely to complete.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0244">This functionality is provided by TeamPortal View <b>214</b>, which enables a user to select a set of people that he or she needs to stay closely in touch with. For this set of people, TeamPortal View <b>214</b> displays the right set of world clocks, as well as world calendars with holidays for the relevant countries. With a single click one can also access the permitted entries of each person's individual calendar.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0245">The presence panel is where the service begins to take advantage of convergence. For each person, a set of icons to the right of the person's name indicates recent activity (or inactivity) of the person's devices. One might see, for example, that Audris used his office phone about 15 minutes ago (light blue square in first column), and is currently using his desktop computer (green square in second column). If you need to reach Audris, a single click on his office phone icon will, depending on your and his individual preferences, connect you by softphones or regular POTS phones in your offices.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0246">Beki, on the other hand, has shown no recent computer activity today, and has not taken or made a call recently from her office phone. Her cell phone is on, however, so you can place a conference call to Audris and Beki from the desktop by selecting both of the appropriate icons. If one or both of them is unavailable, you can set an alarm, and TeamPortal View <b>214</b> will notify you as soon as both of them are available in the way you need, e.g., anything that will support an audio connection.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0247">TeamPortal View <b>214</b> also supports these capabilities beyond your current team, or set of close contacts. Suppose you need to contact someone on the marketing team for a particular product. You navigate to the team's WEB page, and with a single click, TeamPortal View <b>214</b> displays the correct world clocks, calendar, and presence information for the team. If the team has designated a contact person, or a policy for specifying a contact person, only that person's contact and presence information is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0248">Distributed work takes several times as long as comparable same-site work. How do you get the right people together at the same time to resolve an issue, negotiate a solution, or pool their knowledge? You'd like to get together as soon as all the essential people are prepared and available.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0249">The ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> enables communication that closely approximates this ideal. The sender of a ConnectIcon View configures it with a sentence or two describing the nature of the intended meeting, the identity of the receivers, and URLs for any relevant materials. If the receiver also has TeamPortal View <b>214</b>, the ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> is displayed beside the TeamPortal View <b>214</b> interface. A “mouse over” displays the text message, and a right click generates a popup menu that allows the receiver to access any of the URLs specified by the sender, access the sender's calendar, and initiate a chat, e-mail, or audio connection. In addition, the ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> also displays presence data, allowing the receiver to see if it is a good time to initiate contact to take care of the task. As soon as the receiver is prepared, and the sender is available, contact can be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0250">For those without TeamPortal View <b>214</b>, the ConnectIcon View <b>215</b> is delivered as a URL, generally as an e-mail attachment. Clicking it brings up a small iconified picture of the sender, and provides the same functionality as above.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0251">For co-located colleagues working closely together, particularly in stressful or crisis situations, their ability to stay closely in touch just by talking to each other is a huge advantage. In fact, some organizations have experimented with locating everyone in a single room, a “war room,” as a way of speeding up difficult tasks requiring coordinated activity.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0252">Creating long-standing audio connections can create a similar, and in some ways improved, functionality. Whoever is needed, from anywhere in the world, can participate in ongoing work. Anyone can ask a question, or describe a new finding just by talking. For many problems, resolution can be accelerated by passing problem solving off between widely separated time zones, with OpenChannel View <b>217</b> providing the means for the new people to get up to speed during whatever overlap in working hours is available.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0253">The basic long-standing audio connection is enhanced by placing all participants in an application-sharing session so they can jointly view and edit documents, or whatever other applications that might form the basis of collaborative activity. In addition, OpenChannel View <b>217</b> gives participants the opportunity to turn off the sound, if it becomes bothersome, and monitor the audio channel visually. The visualization shows who is participating in the OpenChannel View <b>217</b>, who has spoken recently, and what applications are open in the application sharing session. One can listen to and/or monitor several channels at once.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0254">Together, these three services provide truly effective ways of finding people, connecting with them as soon is it is possible to fruitfully do so, and to provide a channel for extended, background communication as well as foreground communication. By taking full advantage of the convergence offered by SPFS, Lucent is providing radically new capabilities to increase demand for its customers' services.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0255">The service scenarios and call flow diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> illustrate how the end user utilizes the collaboration services on the SPFS and illustrate how the service framework architecture objects work together to provide the collaboration services. In these FIGS., the Soft Endpoint is the user's personal computer <b>207</b>, and two internal classes of the Service Framework <b>201</b> are shown: the Access Session server <b>1201</b> and the Service Session Manager <b>1202</b>. They divide up the work of the Service Framework into request handling and managing ongoing calls. They are an example of a way to write a service framework or SLEE, but other published SLEEs may use different architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0256">Elements <b>1203</b>, <b>1204</b> and <b>1205</b> of the Softswitch <b>213</b> are described in published materials and their internal workings are not necessary for an understanding of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0257">The software objects are grouped into the four major functional categories depicted in the component architecture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the scenario call flow diagrams, the complete set of software objects are not explicitly shown, and some of the objects are abstracted into functional groupings.</p>
