<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for performing a lateral flow assay. The method includes depositing a sample on a test strip at an application region, detecting a first detection signal arising from the test strip in the first detection zone, and generating a baseline for the first measurement zone by interpolating between values of the detection signal outside of the first measurement zone and inside of the first detection zone. The method may include locating a beginning boundary and an ending boundary for the first measurement zone on the test strip. Additional detection zones having measurement zones may also be incorporated with the embodiment.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention pertains to a method and apparatus for performing and analyzing a lateral flow assay. More specifically, the invention provides a method and apparatus for determining the amount of an analyte present in a subject sample.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Immunoassay technology provides simple and relatively quick means for determining the presence of analytes in a subject sample. The information provided from immunoassay tests are often critical to patient care. Assays are typically performed to detect the presence of particular analytes, such as antibodies that are present when a human subject has a particular disease or condition. Assays practiced under the known art are numerous, and may include assays for diseases such as <i>H. pylori</i>, AIDS or conditions such as pregnancy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The advancement of immunoassay technology now allows for assay tests to be performed without the complex and expensive equipment used in hospitals and laboratory settings. Devices for performing assays are now available for home or point of care use to quickly determine the presence of a disease or condition. Such devices typically provide qualitative results for the analyte-or condition being tested for. Examples of such devices include strips that become visually distinguishable when the analyte being sought is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, devices for qualitative analysis of assays are often prone to user error, and lack the accuracy of sophisticated equipment that perform and analyze the assays in hospitals and laboratories. For instance, assay devices often require the user to visually interpret an ongoing chemical reaction. In some applications, if the user mis-times reading the assay device by even a few minutes, the result of the assay may turn from negative to positive. Still, other devices fail to sufficiently distinguish positive from negative results.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Readers are provided in the known art for determining or analyzing the results of assays more accurately. In general, readers provide an improvement in that they may analyze an assay result, thereby removing subjective factors that cause human error. However, whereas readers may reduce operator subjectivity in reading or interpreting assay results, they do not help to control for or help mitigate other sources of assay variability. Such sources may include variability introduced by incorrect assay run times, uncontrolled reaction temperatures, or other possible operator-induced variability.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">This application hereby incorporates U.S. patent application entitled “Improved Lateral Flow Assays,” naming Alan Polito, Richard Thayer, Robert DiNello, and George Sierra as inventors, filed Nov. 23, 1998.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Now turning to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a preferred embodiment of this invention to include a rapid assay reader <b>100</b> for performing and analyzing lateral flow assays. The reader <b>100</b> includes a cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> for receiving a cartridge having a test strip. A computer system, such as a processor and memory resources, is contained within the reader <b>100</b> to control and analyze the assay. The computer system is coupled to an input device such as a keyboard <b>130</b> and an output device such as a display <b>140</b> to allow for user interaction in performing the assay. The reader <b>100</b> may include a battery and/or may be adapted to couple to an AC power supply. A serial port or any other communication outlet may also be provided to upload or download software to and from the computer system contained within the reader <b>100</b>. Steps included in performing an assay under this invention include conducting the assay on a strip (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and analyzing or interpreting the results of the assay conducted on the strip.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows in detail a cartridge <b>210</b> of a preferred embodiment, dimensioned to be received by the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> (shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The cartridge <b>210</b> includes a front end <b>215</b> that inserts into the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b>, and a back end <b>290</b> that includes a handling surface <b>280</b>. A test strip <b>200</b> for performing a lateral flow assay is encased within the cartridge <b>210</b>. Cartridge <b>210</b> may include a sensor code for communicating with the computer system of the reader <b>100</b> on a top surface <b>220</b>. Preferably, the sensor codes are bar codes <b>230</b> that communicate with a bar code reader (shown as second optical sensor <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) within the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The test strip <b>200</b> is exposed through the submerged openings of the cartridge <b>210</b> to provide an application region <b>260</b> in proximity to the back end <b>290</b>, and an assay region <b>250</b> in proximity to the front end <b>215</b>. The assay region <b>250</b> is dimensioned with respect to the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> so that a portion of the cartridge <b>210</b> containing the application region <b>260</b> extends from the reader <b>100</b> when the cartridge <b>210</b> and reader are coupled. A sample may be deposited onto the test strip <b>200</b> at the application region <b>260</b> to transfer by lateral flow to the assay region <b>250</b>. A protective layer (not shown) over the assay region <b>250</b> protects the sample and chemical constituency of the strip from contamination and evaporation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sample deposited on the test strip <b>200</b> may comprise analytes. The term, “analyte,” as used herein, refers to the molecule or compound to be quantitatively determined. Examples of analytes include proteins, such as hormones and other secreted proteins, enzymes, and cell surface proteins; glycoproteins; peptides; small molecules; polysaccharides; antibodies (including monoclonal or polyclonal Ab); nucleic acids; drugs; toxins; viruses or virus particles; portions of a cell wall; and other compounds possessing epitopes. The analyte of interest preferably comprises an immunogenic portion, meaning that antibodies (as described below) can be raised to that portion of the analyte of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a preferred embodiment, the test strip <b>200</b> may also comprise a population of first analyte binding agent, and optionally an analyte non-specific agent, coupled to a detection agent. In another preferred embodiment, the test strip <b>200</b> may also comprise two or more populations. For example, there may be a first population of first analyte binding agent coupled to a detection agent, and a second population of an analyte non-specific agent coupled to a detection agent.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Analyte non-specific agent is defined as an agent non-specific to the analyte of interest. The first analyte binding agents are agents that specifically bind to the analyte of interest. In a preferable embodiment, the first analyte binding agents are antibodies to the analyte of interest. In another preferable embodiment, if the analyte of interest is an antibody of known specificity, the population may comprise the antigen against which the analyte-antibody is directed. The antibodies can be monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies. The term “antibody”, as used herein, also refers to antibody fragments that are sufficient to bind to the analyte of interest. Alternatively, in a preferable embodiment, molecules that specifically bind to the analyte of interest, such as engineered proteins, peptides, haptens, and lysates containing heterogeneous mixture of antigens having analyte binding sites, may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Different detection agents may be employed with different populations of first and/or second analyte binding agents and analyte non-specific agent coupled to a detection agent. This situation may arise, for example, when it is desired to assay two different analytes of interest on the same test strip. Use of two different detection agents facilitates detection of the two different analytes of interest. For example, when the detection agent is a fluorescent agent, the detection agents may be selected to fluoresce at different wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a preferred embodiment, the detection agent is a particle. Examples of particles useful in the practice of the invention include, but are not limited to, colloidal gold particles; colloidal sulphur particles; colloidal selenium particles; colloidal barium sulfate particles; colloidal iron sulfate particles; metal iodate particles; silver halide particles; silica particles; colloidal metal (hydrous) oxide particles; colloidal metal sulfide particles; colloidal lead selenide particles; colloidal cadmium selenide particles; colloidal metal phosphate particles; colloidal metal ferrite particles; any of the above-mentioned colloidal particles coated with organic or inorganic layers; protein or peptide molecules; liposomes; or organic polymer latex particles, such as polystyrene latex beads. Preferable particles are colloidal gold particles. The size of the particles may be related to porosity of the membrane strip: the particles are preferably sufficiently small to be transported along the membrane by capillary action of fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Colloidal gold may be made by any conventional means, such as the methods outlined in G. Frens, 1973 Nature Physical Science, 241:20 (1973). Alternative methods may be described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,578,577, 5,141,850; 4,775,636; 4,853,335; 4,859,612; 5,079,172; 5,202,267; 5,514,602; 5,616,467; 5,681,775.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The selection of particle size may influence such factors as stability of bulk sol reagent and its conjugates, efficiency and completeness of release of particles from the test strip, speed and completeness of the reaction. Also, particle surface area may influence stearic hindrance between bound moieties.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The particles may be labeled to facilitate detection. Examples of labels include, but are not limited to, luminescent labels; colorimetric labels, such as dyes; fluorescent labels; or chemical labels, such as electroactive agents (e.g., ferrocyanide); enzymes; radioactive labels; or radiofrequency labels. The number of particles present in the test strip may vary, depending on the size and composition of the particles, the composition of the test strip and membrane strip, and the level of sensitivity of the assay.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Also coupled to the detection agent may be a analyte non-specific agent. This agent is selected for its ability to bind to substances other than the analyte of interest. For example, if the analyte of interest is an antibody to <i>H. Pylori</i>, then the analyte non-specific agent may be an antibody to an antigen not found, or rarely found, in the antibody to <i>H. Pylori</i>. This binding may be specific for a substance other than the analyte of interest or non-specific for such a substance.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a preferable embodiment, the analyte non-specific agent may be antibodies, more preferably rabbit IgG. The antibodies can be monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies. The term “antibody”, as used herein, also refers to antibody fragments that are sufficient to bind to the analyte of interest. Alternatively, preferably, molecules such as engineered proteins having non-specific binding sites non-specific for the analyte of interest, can also be used. In another embodiment, a receptor that non-specifically binds to ligands other than the analyte of interest can be used, and vice versa. Finally, the analyte non-specific agent may be an antigen, another organic molecule, or a hapten conjugated to a protein non-specific for the analyte of interest. Descriptions of other suitable analyte non-specific agents may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,837, and include IgG, BSA, other albumins, casein, globulin, and immunoglobulin.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a preferable embodiment, the analyte non-specific agent comprises a control binding agent. Control binding agents are selected so as to bind specifically to molecules other than molecules that specifically bind to the analyte of interest. In this way, these control binding agents can bind in control binding zones, as discussed below. Substances useful as control binding agents include those substances described above as useful as first analyte binding agents. In a preferable embodiment, the control binding agent comprises rabbit anti-dinitrophenol (anti-DNP) antibody. Additional beneficial characteristics of control binding agents include, but are not limited to stability in bulk, non-specificity for analyte of interest, reproducibility and predictability of performance in test, molecular size, and avidity of binding to the control agent.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">One or more of the substances discussed above as suitable first analyte binding agents may be used as second analyte binding agents in one or more measurement zones on the strip <b>200</b>. The measurement zone may be either a control zone or an analyte binding zone. In a preferable embodiment, a second analyte binding agent is an antigen recognized by the analyte of interest, which is an antibody. The second analyte binding agent may also be the antigen or even a second antibody specific for the analyte (antibody) of interest. In another preferable embodiment, the analyte of interest is an antigen. The second analyte binding agent, which is an antibody, may be directed against a different epitope of the analyte compared to the first analyte binding agent, when the latter is also an antibody. Alternatively, when the analyte is an antigen with multiple copies of the same epitope, the second analyte binding agent may be directed against the same epitope as the first analyte binding agent.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Control agents, present in the control binding zones, bind specifically to the control binding agent to form a control binding pair. Thus, control agents are those substances that may specifically bind to the control binding agents disclosed herein. A particular advantage of the control binding pairs according to the invention is that they are internal controls—that is, the control against which the analyte measurement results may be compared is present on, the individual test strip. Therefore, the controls according to the invention may be used to correct for strip-to-strip variability. Such correction would be impractical with external controls that are based, for example, on a statistical sampling of strips. Additionally, lot-to-lot, and run-to-run, variations between different test strips may be minimized by use of control binding agents and control agents according to the invention. Furthermore, the effects of non-specific binding may be reduced. All of these corrections would be difficult to accomplish using external, off-strip, controls.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">During the assay, the analytes from the sample and the first analyte binding agent coupled to the detection agent may combine on the test strip with second analyte binding agents in the measurement zones. This combination results in a concentration of compounds that may interrupt the continuous intensity of a signal arising from the test strip <b>200</b>. The compounds may be formed from a combination of above-mentioned analytes and reagents, including antibodies, detection agents, and other particles associated with the analyte binding zone and/or control zone. Based on the particular assay being performed, the control binding zones may be selectively implemented to achieve an appropriate dynamic range which may be linear or non-linear. The respective quantitative values of the high and low control may in turn be fitted to provide a standard curve, which may be used as a calibration parameter to determine a quantitative value for the analyte binding zone. Once the amount of control agent has been quantified (such as in terms of Density of Reflection, discussed below), the amount may then be mapped onto another more meaningful measurement scale, such as Relative Intensity (RI). The RI value may also be assigned concentration values of analytes of interest. In this way, other meaningful units measurements such as number of copies of analytes present or the concentration of analytes present may be read from the standard curve. Finally, signal to cutoff values (S/CO) above which cutoff values the assay result is considered positive may also be derived from the RI value.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During performance of the assay, a measurement zone may comprise a concentration of compounds that measurably affect a signal arising from the strip after the sample is added to the strip. A signal may arise when analytes present in the sample bind to a moiety comprised of the analyte binding agent and analyte non-specific agent coupled to the detection agent, and are further caused to bind to second analyte binding agents and analyte non-specific agents coupled to the detection agents present in the measurement zone to form concentrated regions of compounds. Still further, the compounds in the measurement zones may also be formed from combining a first population of analyte binding agents existing on the application region <b>260</b> with an analyte in the sample, and/or combining the first population of analyte binding agents with a second analyte binding agent existing on the assay region <b>250</b> of the test strip. The first population of analyte binding agents may also include control binding agents that bind with control agents in the control zones once the sample is provided to the application region <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A detection zone is a region on the strip which contains one or more measurement zones. The signal arising from the detection zone corresponding to a concentration of compounds is termed a detection signal. A baseline is an approximation, or average, of the signal arising from any portion of the strip, excluding detection signals. In a preferred embodiment, the signal and detection signals of the strip are reflectance based measurements. As such, one or more measurement zones contain concentrated quantities of compounds or complexes that form relative dark regions against a highly reflective or substantially white surface of the test strip <b>200</b>. In alternative variations, the detection signal may arise from alternative compounds such as those using fluorescent or radioactive agents. In such instances, the signal of the baseline may represent an average value of similar signal on the strip excluding regions containing the measurement zones. In any variation, sensors within the reader <b>100</b> may be used to measure the detection signal arising from the measurement zones relative to the baseline.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As will be described in greater detail, the present invention improves over the known art by determining the baseline across one or more detection zones of the strip in the presence of variations in the background signal. Each detection zone is preferably located such that an automatic or semi-automatic analytical instrument, or a human reader, may determine certain results of the lateral flow assay. Once the baseline in each detection zone is determined, the measurement zones may be quantified and/or compared with respect to the baseline. Values of the measurement zones corresponding to the respective concentration of compounds may then be compared with one another to detect the presence of antigens in sample.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a preferred embodiment, the test strip <b>200</b> is formed from a high binding membrane having a substantially white reflective background, including films such as nitrocellulose. If present, the analytes in the sample react with first analyte binding agent coupled to a detection agent, and with second analyte binding agents in the analyte binding zones of the assay region <b>250</b> to give rise to compounds in a first measurement zone. The compounds are light absorbing compounds that affect the overall reflection intensity of the assay region <b>250</b>. Preferably, the addition of the sample carries from the application region to the assay region <b>250</b> control binding agents coupled to detection agents that combine with control agents in the control binding zones. In a specific application, the addition of the sample carries from the application region <b>260</b> the analyte binding agent and analyte non-specific agent bound to the detection agent and further combines with control agents in the control binding zone. In this manner, the measurement zones corresponding to the control binding zones each contain a relatively known quantity of the light absorbing compounds that create a second and third measurement zone. The reflective surface of the strip <b>200</b> detecting regions excluding the effect of the measurement zones is the baseline of a preferred embodiment. Values may be assigned to the measurement zones formed from the control and/or analyte binding zones based on the intensity of reflection of the respective measurement zone with respect to the baseline. In a preferred embodiment, the values of the measurement zones forming a high and low control zone are normalized to a predetermined value, such as one and three. A relative intensity curve may then be fitted between the values of the high and low control binding zones, as opposed to a standard curve which uses the absolute unit value of the high and low control. The concentration of light absorbing compounds in the measurement zone of the analyte binding zone may then be quantified by placing the value of the reflection intensity onto the relative intensity curve defined by the high and low control values. The presence of analytes that are the subject of the assay may be indicated when the concentration value of analytes in the measurement zone of the analyte binding zone exceeds the cut-off value implemented with the assay.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Under this invention, the sample may include whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, or other biological samples associated with performing assays on humans. The invention may also provide for non-human samples, including samples originating from livestock or food products, as well as veterinary samples. The analytes present on the test strip <b>200</b> and the compounds formed with the sample depend in part on the type of sample provided.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The test strip <b>200</b> of a preferred embodiment provides five measurement zones comprised from three analyte binding zones and two control binding zones. Each analyte binding zone may be implemented to indicate the presence of analytes to such diseases such as <i>H. pylori</i>, AIDS, herpes, and hepatitis. Greater or fewer analyte binding zones or control binding zones are also contemplated by this invention. A preferred embodiment may also be employed to detect the presence of food contamination, such as <i>E. Coli </i>or <i>Salmonella. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing general components of the reader <b>100</b>. The computer system of a preferred embodiment is shown to comprise a processor <b>300</b> having memory resources <b>310</b>. As will be described in greater detail, the memory resources <b>310</b> stores a plurality of assay tables, with each assay table having parameters and fields suited for a particular assay. The processor <b>300</b> receives parameters from the memory resources <b>310</b> and executes an algorithm for controlling and analyzing the assay. The processor <b>300</b> may also receive parameters or prompts from the input device <b>390</b>, which may include a keyboard <b>130</b>, or other suitable devices. An output <b>385</b> may prompt the user for information or provide the results of the assay. The output <b>385</b> may include the display <b>140</b>, or a printer, or other audio/visual devices. The processor may also receive input information or provide output information through a serial port <b>395</b>. The serial port <b>395</b> may comprise an infrared port for transferring information between the reader <b>100</b> and an external computer, but may also include other known serial ports such as a pin connector or modems. Information that may be provided to the computer system may include parameters that reconfigure the assay tables of the memory resources. The information may be provided through the input device <b>390</b>, serial port <b>395</b>, or alternatively through a replacement memory chip such as an insertable memory chip.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a preferred embodiment provides that the processor <b>300</b> is linked via an analog-digital converter <b>320</b> to a first and second sensors <b>340</b> and <b>330</b>. The analog-digital converter <b>320</b> converts analog signals from the optical sensors into voltage counts for the processor <b>300</b>. In alternative embodiments, the analog-digital converter converts signals from a sensor that detects alternative detection signals, such as fluorescence, radiation, magnetic flux, or any other detection signal detectable with a sensor. One of the sensors may be used to input information to the computer system that is contained on detectable codes on the surface <b>220</b> of the cartridge <b>210</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the first and second sensors are light sensors for measuring the reflection intensity arising from the strip <b>200</b>. As such, a preferred embodiment may include a light source <b>350</b> that enhance the detectable reflectance arising from the strip. The processor <b>300</b> may couple to a heater <b>380</b> that heats the sample to a predetermined temperature, thereby increasing the accuracy and speed of the assay. As will be explained below, the processor <b>300</b> controls the temperature and incubation time for the assay. In this manner, the assay may be heated at an optimal temperature and duration. A motor <b>370</b> also couples to the processor and provides a preferred mechanism for scanning the first and second sensors <b>340</b> and <b>330</b> across the test strip <b>200</b> and/or cartridge <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a front view of the reader <b>100</b> detailing a preferred embodiment of the invention. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the cartridge receptacle retains the cartridge <b>210</b> in position to access the test strip <b>200</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the associated components. The cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> also includes a top printed circuit board <b>480</b> and a left sidewall <b>470</b> and a right side wall <b>430</b>. The top printed circuit board <b>480</b> and sidewalls <b>470</b> and <b>430</b> may combine to cover and protect the assay region <b>250</b> of the test strip <b>200</b> from contamination or unwanted elements that may otherwise affect the performance of the assay. A first optical sensor <b>420</b> extends from the top printed circuit board <b>480</b> of the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> and aligns over the assay region <b>250</b> of the test strip <b>200</b>. The first optical sensor <b>420</b> measures the reflectivity of the assay region <b>250</b> once the assay is initiated. The light source may be used with either optical sensor to illuminate the test strip <b>200</b>. A second optical sensor <b>410</b> may be used to read bar codes <b>230</b> provided on the top surface <b>220</b> of the cartridge <b>210</b> (as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that the first optical sensor <b>420</b> and second optical sensor <b>410</b> of a preferred embodiment are vertically offset with respect to one another to compensate for the elevation difference between the bar code <b>230</b> on the cartridge and the assay region <b>250</b> exposed within the cartridge. The cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> may mount to a bottom printed circuit board <b>460</b> to couple the components contained therein with the computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> further shows a first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> positioned on the bottom printed circuit board <b>460</b> to form an autostart trigger <b>400</b>.

Among other advantages, the autostart trigger <b>470</b> improves in part over the prior art in it enables a coupled timer to initiate at an exact moment when the sample is deposited on the application region <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a front isometric view of the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> further detailing the components therein. As shown, the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> includes a front opening <b>570</b> for receiving the cartridge <b>210</b>, and a back end <b>560</b>. A left and right receiving structure <b>515</b> and <b>525</b> for receiving the cartridge <b>210</b> extends from the front opening <b>570</b> to the back end <b>560</b> and in close proximity to the bottom printed circuit board <b>460</b>. The receiving structures are precisely dimensioned to frictionally fit the front end <b>215</b> of the cartridge <b>210</b> (as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> preferably includes a motion mechanism for moving a first optical sensor <b>420</b> with respect to the test strip <b>200</b>. To this end, a left and right rail <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> each mount to a top portion of the respective left and right sidewall <b>470</b> and <b>430</b>, and extend in a longitudinal direction defined by the front opening <b>570</b> and back end <b>560</b>. A sled <b>530</b> slidably mounts over the left rail <b>510</b> and retains the top printed circuit board <b>480</b> that extends to the right rail <b>520</b>. The first optical sensor <b>420</b> and second optical sensor <b>410</b> attach to the top printed circuit board <b>480</b> extending from the sled <b>530</b>. The motor <b>370</b> engages the sled <b>530</b> to longitudinally direct the sled along the rails <b>510</b> and <b>520</b>. The resulting motion of the sled <b>530</b> moves the top printed circuit board <b>480</b>, so that the first optical sensor <b>420</b> and second optical sensor <b>410</b> also move longitudinally within the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b>. In this arrangement, the first optical sensor <b>420</b> and second optical sensor <b>410</b> move over the inserted test strip <b>200</b> in performing the assay. This arrangement allows the test strip <b>200</b> to remain fixed when the sample is deposited to the application region <b>260</b> and flows laterally from the application region <b>260</b> to the assay region <b>250</b>. Alternatively, the motor <b>370</b> may be coupled to the cartridge <b>210</b> to move the test strip <b>200</b> with respect to the sensors. Preferably, the first optical sensor <b>420</b> communicates with the computer system through a single element optical sensor, such as a phototransistor or photodiode device. However, multiple array optical sensors such as digital cameras, diode arrays, CCD arrays, or any other photosensitive imaging device may also be employed with this invention, although such multiple array optical sensors add computation cost to the microprocessor.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows that the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> includes a heating element <b>540</b> for locally heating the test strip <b>200</b>. As previously mentioned, the timing and accuracy for performing the assay may be significantly improved by heating the sample during the assay. As shown by the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the heating element <b>540</b> is a copper or metallic element having sufficient thermal conductive properties to conduct heat to a localized area of the test strip <b>200</b>. In this manner, the heating element <b>540</b> provides for a rapid assay by heating the strip, but not the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b>. As such, the heating element <b>540</b> preserves battery life for field operations, while increasing the speed and accuracy of the assay.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The heating element may be controlled by coupling it to the computer system through associated circuitry (not shown). The associated circuitry may include a temperature feed back control circuit or other sensor, such as a proportional controller or PID controllers, to precisely regulating the temperature of the heating element <b>540</b>. The computer system may provide the exact temperature and incubation time for switching the heating element on and off. In this manner the heating element <b>540</b> may be operated at the optimal temperature and incubation time for a particular assay. As will be described below, the optimal temperature and incubation time for any particular assay may be provided by an assay table stored in the memory resources <b>310</b> of the computer system. Accordingly, the heating element <b>540</b> of a preferred embodiment may enhance the flexibility of the reader <b>100</b> to perform a wide range of assays.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further details the autostart trigger <b>400</b> of a preferred embodiment. The first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> that comprise the autostart trigger <b>400</b> may be any electrical lead, including metal plates or meshes. As shown, the first and second pads <b>440</b> and <b>450</b> may be mounted in co-planar fashion to the bottom printed circuit board <b>460</b>. Preferably, the pads combine to form a capacitor, with each pad forming a capacitor plate. In alternative variations, the pads may combine to provide a detectable electrical field that noticeably changes upon deposition of the sample. Upon entrance of the cartridge <b>210</b> into the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b>, the test strip <b>200</b> is aligned so that an area under the assay region <b>250</b> contacts the heating element <b>540</b>. Once aligned, the application region <b>260</b> is in close proximity to the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b>. The alignment of the test strip <b>200</b> is illustrated by the region corresponding to numeral <b>580</b>. Alternative variations allow the positions of the first and second pads <b>440</b> and <b>450</b> to be moved away from the bottom printed circuit board <b>460</b>, as the pads may be positioned anywhere relative to the strip <b>200</b> to allow the capacitance or electrical field to be affected by the deposition of the sample. Similarly, the alignment of the pads may be non-coplanar, or even perpendicular, as such alternative positions still produce an electrical field that is affected by the deposition of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram that details the autostart trigger <b>400</b> of a preferred embodiment. The first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> are arranged on the bottom printed circuit board <b>460</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to couple with an electrical potential to form a sensing capacitor for detecting when the sample is deposited onto the application region <b>260</b> of the test strip <b>200</b>. The autostart trigger may couple to the computer system through a sensory output line <b>640</b>. The signal from the autostart trigger <b>400</b> may be amplified prior to being received by the computer system. As shown by a preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the test strip <b>200</b> aligns over a portion of the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b>, with the space between the first and second pad being aligned over the centerline of the test strip <b>200</b> (as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The test strip <b>200</b> is placed in sufficient proximity to form a portion of the dielectric layer between the capacitor formed by the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b>. Alternatively, the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> may abut the bottom portion of the test strip <b>200</b>. In this arrangement, the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> may be coupled to a current source <b>610</b> that causes the voltage on the sensing pads to ramp up. A switch <b>620</b> may be coupled to the current source <b>610</b> to allow the sensing pads <b>440</b> and <b>450</b> to discharge periodically. The voltage on the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> signal a sawtooth waveform, with an average value related to the capacitance between the first and second sensing pads <b>440</b> and <b>450</b>. A low pass filter <b>630</b> may be coupled to generate the average value of the voltage on the sensing pads <b>440</b> and <b>450</b>. Prior to the time the sample is deposited, the application region <b>260</b> is dry and the dielectric constant formed in part by the test strip <b>200</b> is low. When the sample is applied to the application region <b>260</b>, the dielectric constant is significantly increased, causing a change in the capacitance between the sensing plates. A software algorithm executed by the computer system may then be used to compare the curve of the capacitance versus time across the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> to detect the presence of a sample based on a threshold change in the capacitance curve. In alternative variations, depositing the sample induces a change in the electrical fields between the electrical leads. In this manner, the autostart trigger <b>400</b> may detect the change in capacitance of the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> upon addition of the sample to the application region <b>260</b> of the test strip <b>200</b>. Once the sample is detected by the autostart trigger <b>400</b>, the computer system initiates timing the assay. Timing the assay allows the assays to be analyzed by the sensors and processor at an exact moment after the sample is deposited. As such, the reader <b>100</b> provides an advantage over the known art in that it avoids inaccuracies that result from mis-timing the moment at which the final analysis of the test strip <b>200</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Several alternative methods for detecting the change in the capacitance of the pads <b>440</b> and <b>450</b> exist. For example, the first pad <b>440</b> and second pad <b>450</b> may be used to form a capacitor element of an inductor-capacitor (“LC”) circuit. The LC circuit may be coupled to an oscillator, and associated circuitry may then be implemented to sense the change in capacitance when the fluid sample is added to the application region <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In alternative embodiments of the present invention, an autostart trigger may be coupled to or comprises within the reader <b>100</b>′ of the present invention to detect any physical change arising from depositing the sample on the strip. For example, sensors may be coupled to the processor to detect changes in the surface tension of either the strip <b>200</b> or of the sample being deposited on the strip. Alternatively, sensors may also couple to the strip to determine the conductivity of the strip before and after the sample is determined. Such sensors may include implementing a voltage potential on one end of the application region <b>260</b>, and determining the current or voltage on another end of the application region before and after the deposition of the sample to the strip <b>200</b>. Other alternative variations for autostart triggers may be found in the prior art, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,531 to Zweig, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,794 to Allen, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a preferred embodiment, the autostart trigger <b>400</b> generates a continuous waveform that is affected by any change in the dielectric layer or electric field shared between the sensor pads <b>440</b> and <b>450</b>. For example, insertion of the cartridge <b>210</b> may interfere with the dielectric layer or electric field between the sensor pads to cause the resulting waveform to change sufficiently to falsely indicate the presence of a sample. Therefore, a preferred embodiment also includes a mechanism that prevents the autostart trigger <b>400</b> from signaling the processor until a time delay period after the insertion of the cartridge <b>210</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the mechanism includes an infrared sensor mounted within the cartridge receptacle <b>120</b> that signals the computer system upon insertion of the cartridge <b>210</b>. The processor <b>300</b> may be programmed or otherwise provided with resources to preclude the autostart trigger from signaling the processor of a capacitance change for a time delay period after the insertion of the cartridge <b>210</b>. The time delay is preferably shorter than the minimum time needed by a user to deposit the sample after the cartridge is inserted. In this manner, the insertion of the cartridge will not falsely signal the processor to initiate the timer for the assay. Rather, the time delay ensures that the timer for the assay will not be signaled until the sample is deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As noted, the reader <b>100</b> includes resources such as the processor <b>300</b> and memory resources <b>310</b> that retain parameters and information for controlling and analyzing the assay. The parameters and fields may be stored in the memory resources <b>310</b>, and include fields for performing the algorithm that analyzes and interprets the results of the assay. The fields and parameters may be grouped into assay tables, which may be selected according to the particular assay being performed. In this manner, the assay table encodes any combination of fields and parameters for analyzing distinct assays, as well as including fields and parameters to correctly analyze each assay. The assay tables may be reconfigured to provide one or more updated parameters for assays, or to include additional assay tables for new assays. The assay tables may be reconfigured by a combination of the input device <b>390</b>, serial port <b>395</b>, and replaceable memory resources <b>310</b>. Thus, the assay table may be reconfigured in any number of ways, including modifying a single element through the bar code on the cartridge <b>210</b> or by uploading an entirely new assay table. A preferred embodiment employs Dallas Buttons as memory resources, which may be easily removed or added to a compartment or surface of the reader <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In more detail, the memory resources <b>310</b> of a preferred embodiment may include the following parameters as fields included in the assay tables:</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">ZONELOCATION: This field identifies the location or relative position of the measurement zones on the test strip <b>200</b>. The field is preferably 15 bits, with each 3 bits identifying a particular measurement zone. The measurement zones may be selected to correspond to either analyte binding zones or control binding zones, thereby allowing the respective zones to be positioned anywhere on the test strip <b>200</b> with respect to one another. A preferred embodiment stores five measurement zones on the strip, including measurement zones for three analyte binding zones and two control binding zones. The control binding zones may be high or low control, while each analyte binding zone may include an analyte for one or more assays. The ability of the reader to allow for selection of the position of the measurement zones for the control binding zones and analyte binding zones is particularly advantageous, since the presence of an upstream measurement zone may affect the chemical constituency of a downstream measurement zone during lateral flow. Therefore, the optimal relative position of the control binding zones and the analyte binding zones may differ from assay to assay. A preferred embodiment provides flexibility in ensuring the control and analyte binding zones may be positioned in their optimal position on the test strip <b>200</b> for any particular assay.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">HIGHCONTROL/LOWCONTROL: These fields specify relative values of the detection signal arising from the high and low control binding zones. The values from these fields may be assigned from the assay table to the algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">ASSAYID: The particular assay table to be employed for the assay is specified by this field. The field is preferably specified from the bar code on the cartridge <b>210</b> carrying the test strip <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">MAXCONTROLRAT/MINCONTROLRAT: These fields specifies the maximum and minimum ratio between the measurement zones corresponding to the high and low control binding zones.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">METHODSIZE: This field determines the method for interpreting the results of the assay, and the sample size to be used in the assay. Preferably, the processor <b>300</b> internally determines the results of the assay by using a relative intensity curve. Based on the value of this field stored or inputted into the assay table, the results may then be displayed to the user using either signal cut-off value, standard curve, or the relative intensity curve. With the standard or relative intensity curve, the detection signal arising from the measurement zone of the analyte binding zone is quantified from the curve, and then compared to the cut-off value to determine if sufficient analytes exist for a positive reading. The detection signal arising from the measurement zone of the analyte binding zone is divided by the cut-off value to determine the signal-cut-off value. The ability to select or predetermine the method for interpreting any particular assay further enhances the flexibility provided to the user by the reader <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">KINITICSTARTTIME: This field may be used to specify the time interval beginning with the addition of the sample until the first read occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">ASSAYTIME: This field specifies the total assay time in seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">ASSAYTEMP: This field specifies the preferred temperature for running a particular assay.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">LOWCONTROLMINDR/LOWCONTROLMAXDR: These fields specify the minimum and maximum low control values quantitatively. In a preferred embodiment, the fields are expressed in terms of Density of Reflection (DR), as further described below. If the low control is either below LOWCONTROLMINDR or above LOWCONTROLMAXDR, an error will be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">CUTOFFRATIO: This field specifies the cutoff ratio used to determine whether a given measurement zone of an analyte binding zone is positive or negative. This field may be provided in the assay as a predetermined value based on laboratory experimentation. In a preferred embodiment, the field may be altered by the bar code, which provides a multiplication factor for the value of the field stored in the assay table. Alterations in the bar code may then change the cut-off value. As such, the assays are not limited to a strict cut-off value, but rather may provide cut-off values as a variable input to the algorithm. This enables the cut-off values to be altered as the need arises.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The processor <b>300</b> uses the assay tables of the memory resources, as well as parameters and fields inputted through the input device <b>390</b> and/or serial port <b>395</b>, to execute an algorithm that accurately analyzes and interprets the results of the assay. The processor may also receive prompts or input information for running the algorithm from the bar codes <b>230</b> via the second optical sensor <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> describes a preferred algorithm performed by the processor <b>300</b> in determining the results of the lateral flow assay. The algorithm of this invention analyzes the results of the lateral flow assay by generating a baseline, quantifying the measurement zones with respect to the baseline, and then comparing measurement zones corresponding to the control binding zones and analyte binding zone. The baseline is generated to approximate the signal of the strip <b>200</b> as if the measurement zone is not present. In order to attain the most accurate results for a preferred embodiment, the baseline should approximate the reflectance of the test strip <b>200</b> after the assay has been performed. However, the baseline of the actual test strip <b>200</b> after the performance of the assay is not constant across the strip. Rather, several factors contribute to produce an uneven or spotty baseline. For example, when performing an assay by measuring the reflectance arising from the strip, the reflectance of the baseline may be affected by (1) wave fronts created by the sample which create patches of wet and dry regions along the length of the strip; (2) non-specific binding, which results in the formation of light absorbing particles in between the measurement zones; (3) warpage in the nitrocellulose layer; and (4) manufacturing problems in implementing a flat test strip <b>200</b> within the cartridge <b>210</b>. In addition, when whole blood is used as the sample, the baseline reflection may be affected by red blood cells or hemogloblin.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In several examples provided by the known art, these problems have been avoided by generating a baseline from a dry strip, or inputting the baseline as a known constant into a calculation for evaluating measurement zones. These approximations for the baseline as determined by the known art lack accuracy, however, as the approximations are not from the strip after undergoing the assay. Thus, the baseline incorporated for interpreting assays in the known art fail to account for example, ripples that actually change the reflectance of the strip and thereby affect the results of the assay. Similarly, the known art fails to account for measurement zones containing compounds formed after the sample is deposited on the strip.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Among other advantages, this invention improves in part over the known art by approximating a baseline from the test strip <b>200</b> after the assay is performed. The resulting approximation is considerably more accurate for evaluating the measurement zones and comparing the measurement zones to one another. In a preferred embodiment, the algorithm generates the baseline by approximating a relatively flat baseline in detection zones where the intensity of reflectance of the strip is variable with respect to the background of the strip. In particular, the detection zones include measurement zones corresponding to the control binding zones and/or analyte binding zones, which contain concentrated amounts of light absorbing compounds. The algorithm then uses the baseline to quantify or evaluate the measurement zones with respect to the baseline, and then compares the value of each measurement zone to determine the presence of disease. In a preferred embodiment, the measurement zones are quantified by using the baseline to determine the Density of Reflection (DR) of the measurement zone. Alternatively, the measurement zones may be quantified through equations or functions that compare the detection signal arising from the measurement zone with respect to the detection signal arising from the remainder of the test strip. The measurement zones may also be evaluated qualitatively with respect to the baseline, or mapped using the baseline to determine the results of the assay.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In step <b>700</b> of the algorithm, the first optical sensor <b>420</b> scans or views the test strip <b>200</b> and compiles an array of raw data RAW that corresponds to the intensity of the reflectance of the strip. Alternative embodiments of this invention may provide for a sensor that detects detection signals such as fluorescence or radiation. In either case, the array RAW represents voltage counts of the analog-digital converter which may be coupled to the sensor of the particular variation to reflect the intensity of the alternative detection signals. In a successful assay performed under a preferred embodiment that measures reflectance from the strip <b>200</b>, the measurement zone of the high control zone is relatively darker or less intense in reflectance than the measurement zone of the low control zone due to a greater concentration of light absorbing particles. One or more measurement zones of analyte binding zones may also be present, depending on whether the samples contained analytes. As such, the darkness or reflectance intensity of the analyte binding zones is a variable measurement zone. The array RAW records the reflectance intensity arising from the strip, including the reflectance of the measurement zones. The array RAW is then filtered by a low-pass filter that represents a moving average of the array RAW. The filtered data is retained in the array FILT.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Step <b>720</b> shows that a Boolean operation assigns a binary state to the individual elements of FILT. In a preferred embodiment, the Boolean operation is designed to approximate the proximity of the individual array element to an average white reflectance. When the state assigned by the Boolean operation is “true”, the individual elements of FILT are termed “white”. For purposes of this disclosure, “white” refers to elements that fall within a range of threshold approximations of the average white for the strip. When the Boolean operation is “false”, the individual elements of FILT are “dark”. The term “dark” refers to elements that are not white, or false under the Boolean condition provided above. Numerous operations may be used with this invention to assign the binary state to the elements of FILT. For example, the Boolean operation may reflect a substantial change between the reflection intensity of adjoining points or a selected block of points.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a preferred embodiment, the Boolean operation is modeled after a non-linear decay circuit comprising a diode-resistor-capacitor, as shown by a circuit <b>725</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>. The charging voltage on the capacitor may be modeled after the following equations:
<br/>

<br/>
In the above equations, DF represents an exponential or high order decay factor. The value of DF is preferably chosen to match the degree of ripple or other defect observed in actual strips. Large value for DF are appropriate for “good” strips which have fewer ripples, and provides for the best detection of small signals. Smaller values for DF reject larger defects at the expense of reduced ability to distinguish small signals from the baseline. In this model, Vin is provided by FILT, and an array NONL stores Vout. Under a preferred embodiment, when equation (1) is true, elements of FILT are assigned a “white” state in CHG and equation (1) applies in determining NONL. If equation (1) holds to be false, then the elements of FILT are assigned a “dark” state in CHG, and equation (2) applies in determining NONL. Once the CHG and NONL arrays are determined, the array BASE representing the baseline may be formulated. Initially, BASE is set to zero in step <b>730</b>.

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">The subroutine <b>800</b> generates the baseline approximation for detection zones on the strip based on the information stored in FILT, CHG, and NONL. The first step <b>810</b> calculates the derivative of FILT with respect to BASE and stores the values in an array DERIV1. The next step <b>820</b> calculates the derivative of DERIV1 with respect to BASE and stores the values in an array DERIV2. In step <b>830</b>, all maximas and minimas are determined from DERIV1 and stored in an array MAXIM. The elements of MAXIM may be either local maximas/minimas or endpoints to measurement zones that correspond with array elements of FILT. In addition, individual elements of CHG, DERIV1, and DERIV2, correspond to the same elements of FILT.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">The algorithm then identifies in step <b>840</b> a beginning point to each measurement zone present on the strip. Step <b>845</b> of a preferred embodiment shows than an element of MAXIM is a beginning point of a measurement zone if it immediately precedes or is at a location where CHG switches from “white” to “dark”. This criteria ensures that the maxima is a beginning point to a measurement zone as opposed to a local maxima or a minima. By properly choosing the DF, most of the local maximas and minimas may be removed from FILT. Once a beginning point is found, step <b>850</b> seeks the ending point of the measurement zone by first identifying an element of MAXIM where CHG changes states from “dark” to “white”. The algorithm then implements a criteria for determining a subsequent point in a “white” state that is an endpoint to the measurement zone. The criteria may include steps <b>860</b> and <b>870</b>, which determines whether a first and second derivative threshold is met by an element of MAXIM subsequent to the point found in step <b>850</b>. The first and second derivative thresholds may be implemented as predetermined constants.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">Once the endpoint to the measurement zone is found, the algorithm in step <b>880</b> interpolates between the beginning and ending points of the measurement zone. The interpolation may be accomplished by connecting the beginning and ending points through a straight line or through some other function that approximates a baseline between the two points. The algorithm also interpolates a baseline in the detection zones encompassing points beyond the measurement zone. Interpolation in the detection zones may be accomplished by connecting the respective maximas and minimas outside of the measurement zone. All interpolated points may then be stored in BASE.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">In a preferred embodiment, anywhere between two to five measurement zones may be present on the test strip <b>200</b>. In step <b>885</b>, the algorithm checks to see whether all data in FILT has been checked to ensure all measurement zones are located. If additional points are present, the algorithm returns to step <b>850</b> to determine whether additional measurement zones exist on the test strip <b>200</b>. When all values of FILT have been checked, step <b>890</b> performs a max BASE with NONL, where corresponding elements of the two arrays are compared, and BASE receives the greater of the two elements. This step serves as another approximation to the baseline generated by the subroutine <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">The approximation of the baseline may be improved by repeating steps <b>810</b> through <b>890</b> again, except in the subsequent loop BASE is an approximation of the average baseline of the strip, rather than “0”. The second approximation of the baseline differs in that DERIV1 and DERIV2 may be calculated with respect to BASE having values of the average baseline. The resulting baseline is a much smoother approximation of the average baseline for the strip. The subroutine for determining the baseline may be repeated a number of times, but beyond two iterations yields insignificant improvements.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">Once the baseline is generated, the algorithm then proceeds to determine the reflection intensity of the strip in subroutine <b>900</b> by using FILT and BASE. In step <b>910</b> reflection intensity may be calculated by determining the DR, represented by the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>DR</i>=log [(FILT−BLACK)/(BASE−BLACK)]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
BLACK may be an array of constants that correspond to the reflection of the strip when the light within the cartridge receptacle is turned off. In a preferred embodiment, the DR is calculated only for minimas between each pair of maximas. This allows for the use of a small processor for field uses of the reader. Alternatively, the DR of every element of FILT may be determined with larger processors. In variations of the invention, the difference between the intensity of the detection signal and the baseline may be evaluated using different formulas and criteria. The equation provided above is preferred for reflectance based assays.
</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">In step <b>920</b>, DR for each determined measurement zone is checked against preselected limits stored in the assay table. This step may include checking parameters such as HIGH CONTROL and LOWCONTROL, MAXCONTROLRAT and MINCONTROLRAT, as well as other parameters that may indicate an error in the assay. The spacing between measurement zones is also checked to conform to the preselected spacing, which in a preferred embodiment is retained in the assay table as MINBANDSPACING and MAXBANDSPACING.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">Valid measurement zones are detected in step <b>925</b> and recorded in step <b>930</b> as a separate sequence. Once all valid measurement zones are recorded, the algorithm checks in step <b>940</b> for gaps in the sequence. Instances when gaps may be found include when the sample that lack antigens, i.e. where the assay is negative. If a gap is found in step <b>945</b>, the gap is interpolated over and added to the table of measurement zones in step <b>950</b>. The algorithm stops in step <b>960</b> once the number of detected measurement zones and gaps matches the number of measurement zones expected by the input to the reader <b>100</b>. Otherwise, steps <b>910</b>-<b>960</b> are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a graph of values generated by the algorithm of a preferred embodiment, detailing the generation of the baseline and the evaluation of the measurement zones for the control and analyte binding zones with respect to the baseline. Curve A is derived from FILT, and is a quantified representation of the strip in terms of the voltage count detected from the A/D converter. While the voltage counts of curve A represent reflection intensity arising from the strip, in alternative embodiments, the voltage counts may represent the intensity of any detection signal arising from the strip. In a preferred embodiment, brighter or more reflective surfaces produce a higher count on the graph presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In region I, curve A shows the first optical sensor <b>420</b> as being away from the test strip <b>200</b>. In region II, the optical sensor scans a shadow region formed by the edge of the exposed test strip <b>200</b> and the cartridge <b>110</b>. The shadow region may be used by the processor to synchronize the first optical sensor <b>420</b> with the location of the measurement zone for the control and/or analyte binding zones. The values of DERIV1 are generally greater in the shadow region due to the lack of reflection. Once the derivative of curve A is determined to exceed a predetermined threshold value corresponding to the slope of the shadow region, the position of the optical sensor is then marked as the beginning of the test strip <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">Region III of curve A contains a measurement zone Z<b>1</b> present on the test strip <b>200</b>. The algorithm detects the beginning point Mx<b>11</b> and ending point Mx<b>12</b> of the measurement zone Z<b>1</b>. Each beginning and ending point is contained within region III and just outside the measurement zone Z<b>1</b>, where the reflection of the measurement zones become noticeably different than the average background reflection. As illustrated by curve A, the beginning point Mx<b>11</b> is a maxima on the curve A that is subsequently followed by curve A changing from a “white” state to a “dark” state. As previously noted, the change of state is stored in CHG. A minima Mi<b>11</b> is the point between the beginning and ending points Mx<b>11</b> and Mx<b>12</b>, and represents an area of the measurement zone having the least reflection or lowest-count. The maxima Mx<b>12</b> follows curve A changing state from “dark” to “white” and meets the threshold test of steps <b>860</b> and <b>870</b> of the algorithm of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Curve B shows a baseline generated from the algorithm of a preferred embodiment to further quantify curve A. The baseline matches the filtered points of curve A outside of the measurement zone Z<b>1</b>. Inside the measurement zone Z<b>1</b>, a function connects the beginning and ending points Mx<b>11</b> and Mx<b>12</b> to form the baseline. Preferably, the function is a straight line between the two points, although other functions may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">Regions IV and V produce measurement zones Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>3</b>, corresponding to additional measurement zones present on the strip. As with measurement zone Z<b>1</b>, the baseline represented by curve B may be interpolated between beginning points Mx<b>21</b>, Mx<b>31</b> and ending points Mx<b>22</b>, Mx<b>32</b> of respective measurement zones Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>3</b>. Likewise, each measurement zone Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>3</b> includes a minima Mi<b>22</b>, Mi<b>33</b> which represents the area of the respective measurement zone having the least reflective properties.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, measurement zones Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b> correspond to high and low control binding zones on the test strip, and measurement zone Z<b>3</b> corresponds to the analyte binding zone. A preferred embodiment may be employed with the assay tables stored in the memory resources <b>310</b> to provide flexibility in performing the assay and analyzing the results. In particular, the location of the particular zones may be controlled by ZONELOCATION, so that measurement zone Z<b>1</b> or Z<b>2</b> may alternatively represent the analyte binding zone. The values of measurement zones Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b> may be controlled by HIGHCONTROL and LOWCONTROL. The ratio between Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b> may be limited by MAXCONTROLRAT and MINCONTROLRAT. The field SPACING may be used to provide for the relative distance between the measurement zones.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">Curve C represents curve A quantified with respect to curve B. In a preferred embodiment, curve C is determined by approximating the DR in the measurement zones, using values of curve A corresponding to FILT and curve B corresponding to BASE. The DR of each measurement zone may be determined by determining the DR of the minima for each measurement zone. Alternatively, the DR for each element of FILT represented by curve A may be determined with respect to curve B and BASE. The output may be represented through a relative intensity curve. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the ratio of values for the high and low control represented by measurement zones Z<b>1</b>/Z<b>2</b> is approximately three. The value of the measurement zone Z<b>3</b> representing the analyte binding zone is determined relative to the values for the measurement zones Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b>. In this method, the values of the respective measurement zones may be determined in terms of RI.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">In a preferred embodiment, the reader <b>100</b> will provide a “positive” result to the user if the value of measurement zone Z<b>3</b> representing the analyte binding zone is greater than the cut-off value. The cut-off value may be altered between the assays by multiplying CUTOFFRATIO by a factor inputted into the processor <b>300</b> by the bar code or other input device.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">From the above description, the algorithm of a preferred embodiment may include (1) a peak detector based on digital implementation of a Boolean function, such as the analog diode-RC combination shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>; (2) a non-linear interpolation of maxima using information from the first and second derivatives, where the information is derived from raw data recording the intensity of detection signals arising from the strip <b>200</b>; and (3) repeating step (2) for further accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">While a preferred embodiment may use the methods presented above, other methods may also generate a baseline across a test strip undergoing or having undergone an assay. In general, other methods presented below have fewer advantages than the methods described above, in that the methods below may require additional computational costs, lack precision, and may be limited in applications or diversity. These other methods may include employing a peak detector to detect the maximas/minimas of the data representing the detection signals from the test strip <b>200</b>, where the peak detector is symmetrically employed to evaluate the values of the detection signal in a first direction across the strip, and then employed again to evaluate the values of the detection signals in the reverse direction to the first direction across the strip. Such a filter is more appropriate when the data representing the values of the detection signal is symmetrical with respect to a front and back end of the assay region of the strip <b>200</b>. Such a peak detector would no longer require an array such as CHG, because the Boolean values stored in that array lack the asymmetry that requires the use of first and second derivative thresholds to disambiguate the light/dark transitions. A change to a symmetric filter would eliminate some steps in the non-linear interpolation, and achieve comparable results at the expense of modest increases in computational complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">Several other classes of filter are also possible which do not require an “analog” circuit model as described elsewhere in the application. In addition, an interpolation step based on “peaks” from the peak detector rather than “maxima” is possible. Such an interpolation would be sub-optimal, as it would tend to over-estimate the baseline and thus over-estimate the DRs when the general trend of the data is rising or falling. However, one possible advantage of such a method would be to avoid the use of derivatives entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">Still further, other variations to a preferred embodiment using the methods described above for generating a baseline include using a peak minima when excessive band widths are encountered to detect a peak pair where the gap between peaks does not return to the baseline. This step may be employed by providing a table of minima from the first derivative to be assembled.</p>
