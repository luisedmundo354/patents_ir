<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to a non-volatile memory and its operation, and, more specifically, to determining aborted write and erase operations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A common application of flash EEPROM devices is as a mass data storage subsystem for electronic devices. Such subsystems are commonly implemented as either removable memory cards that can be inserted into multiple host systems or as non-removable embedded storage within the host system. In both implementations, the subsystem includes one or more flash devices and often a subsystem controller.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flash EEPROM devices are composed of one or more arrays of transistor cells, each cell capable of non-volatile storage of one or more bits of data. Thus flash memory does not require power to retain the data programmed therein. Once programmed however, a cell must be erased before it can be reprogrammed with a new data value. These arrays of cells are partitioned into groups to provide for efficient implementation of read, program and erase functions. A typical flash memory architecture for mass storage arranges large groups of cells into erasable blocks, wherein a block contains the smallest number of cells (unit of erase) that are erasable at one time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one commercial form, each block contains enough cells to store one sector of user data plus some overhead data related to the user data and/or to the block in which it is stored. The amount of user data included in a sector is the standard 512 bytes in one class of such memory systems but can be of some other size. Because the isolation of individual blocks of cells from one another that is required to make them individually erasable takes space on the integrated circuit chip, another class of flash memories makes the blocks significantly larger so there is less space required for such isolation. But since it is also desired to handle user data in much smaller sectors, each large block is often further partitioned into individually addressable pages that are the basic unit for reading and programming user data. Each page usually stores one sector of user data, but a page may store a partial sector or multiple sectors. A “sector” is used herein to refer to an amount of user data that is transferred to and from the host as a unit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The subsystem controller in a large block system performs a number of functions including the translation between logical addresses received by the memory sub-system from a host, and physical addresses within the memory cell array. This translation often involves use of intermediate terms for a logical block number (LBN) and logical page. The controller also manages the low-level flash circuit operation through a series of commands that it issues to the flash memory devices via an interface bus. Another function the controller performs is to maintain the integrity of data stored to the subsystem through various means, such as by using an error correction code (ECC).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In case of a power outage during operation of such a memory circuit, for example if a memory card is removed from a host or a power is lost to a device with an integrated memory, the memory may be caught in the middle of a write or erase operation, resulting in an incomplete operation. For example, if a memory system loses power during a programming process when most, but not all, of the cells in a group being written have reached their target state, the write group may contain a large number of errors. As is familiar in the art, it is common to incorporate error correction code (ECC) into memory systems to determine and correct data errors. A power outage before completion of a programming operation can cause the write group to be in three situations when the interrupted write group is read: (1) it is correctable by ECC; (2) it is uncorrectable by ECC; and (3) an ECC mis-detect can occur. In the first case, the extent of the error is minor enough where the error correction code can salvage the data. In the second case, the data will be incorrect, but the system will determine this condition. In the third case, the data will again be incorrect, but, due to an ECC mis-detect, the system is unaware of the situation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This last case, the ECC mis-detect, can occur if, for example, the ECC has the capacity to correct up to, say, 4 bits of error, but 7 bits of data in the write group were not correctly written. The system will then unaware of the incorrectly written data and operate as if it has corrected any error in the write group, but the data will still be wrong. A similar situation can occur if power loss occurs during an erase process. These scenarios make ECC write and erase abort detection far from perfect and are particularly troublesome for mission critical situations where it is important to know if the data has been correctly entered. Consequently, there is room for improvement in this aspect of memory systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, the present invention presents a non-volatile memory and method for its operation that ensures reliable mechanism for write and erase abort detection in the event of lost of power during non-volatile memory programming and erasing with minimized system performance penalty. In an exemplary embodiment, to ensure a write abort failure can be reliably detected with minimal performance impact, a new write abort detection mechanism is introduced. The algorithm includes a Previous Sector Status flag (PSS) and a Last Sector Status flag (LSS) in the sector overhead information, where the Previous Sector Status flag (PSS) can be protected by ECC.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a multi-sector write process, writing sectors <b>0</b> to x in a block, after programming the data in sector <b>0</b>, the algorithm will write the PSS of sector <b>1</b> along with the data in sector <b>1</b> to denote sector <b>0</b> has completed programming and no write abort occurred; after sector <b>1</b> is programmed, the algorithm will write the PSS of sector <b>2</b> along with the data in sector <b>2</b> to denote sector <b>1</b> has completed programming and no write abort occurred; and so on, until the last sector is programmed. To denote that the last sector has completed programming without a write abort, the LSF of the last sector is written. Consequently, only last sector in the host program command requires two programming operation to ensure write abort detection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the present invention, the mechanism ensures write abort failure detection by looking at the PSS of next physical sector and at the LSS of current sector is the sector is the last programmed sector in the block or the last physical sector of the block.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further aspect of the present invention, an erase abort flag (EAF) in the first sector of the block can be marked after a successful erase operation. With these flags, the system can successful detect a write abort or an erase abort during next initialization of next power on. The write abort detection scheme is especially effective for multi-state memory: (1) it is more difficult and costly to design hardware to handle multi-state systems due to longer programming time required, and (2) the performance gained from not programming twice on every single sector is much greater on multi-state systems also due to longer programming time requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional aspects, features and advantages of the present invention are included in the following description of exemplary embodiments, which description should be taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example Non-Volatile Memory System</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, a specific non-volatile memory system is described in which the various aspects of the present invention are implemented, in order to provide specific examples. To reduce the amount of disturb in erase processes, the present invention maintains the control gates of non-selected storage elements at the same voltage level as their underlying well structure. In a exemplary embodiment, the storage elements are formed over a well structure. During an erase process, both the selected and non-selected storage elements over the well are raised to an erase voltage concurrently with establishing this voltage level in the well. This voltage is then held on the well and the non-selected storage elements, thereby reducing the chance of any erase related disturbs, while the selected storage elements are allowed to discharge, producing the needed erase conditions. Further, this can be accomplished without increasing any pitch area of circuit or adding new wires in the memory array, resulting in minimal additional peripheral area being added to the circuit.</p>

When specific voltages are needed in the following, the erase voltage V<sub>erase </sub>is taken to be in the 15-20 volt range, the low logic level is taken as ground, and the high logic level V<sub>dd </sub>taken in the 1.5-3 volt range, although other values can be used, depending on design.</p>

The column control circuit <b>2</b> is connected to bit lines (BL) of the memory cell array <b>1</b> for reading data stored in the memory cells (M), for determining a state of the memory cells (M) during a program operation, and for controlling potential levels of the bit lines (BL) to promote the programming or to inhibit the programming. The row control circuit <b>3</b> is connected to word lines (WL) to select one of the word lines (WL), to apply read voltages, to apply a program voltages combined with the bit line potential levels controlled by the column control circuit <b>2</b>, and to apply an erase voltage coupled with a voltage of p-type regions (labeled as “c-p-well” <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) on which the memory cells (M) are formed.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data stored in the memory cells (M) are read out by the column control circuit <b>2</b> and are output to external I/O lines via an I/O line and a data input/output buffer <b>6</b>.

The external I/O lines are connected to a controller <b>20</b>. Command data for controlling the flash memory device are input to a command interface connected to external control lines, which are connected with the controller <b>20</b>.

The controller converts such commands into command signals that can be interpreted and executed by the command circuits <b>7</b>. The controller also typically contains buffer memory for the user data being written to or read from the memory array. A typical memory system includes one integrated circuit chip <b>21</b> that includes the controller <b>20</b>, and one or more integrated circuit chips <b>22</b> that each contain a memory array and associated control, input/output and state machine circuits. The trend, of course, is to integrate the memory array and controller circuits of a system together on one or more integrated circuit chips. The memory system may be embedded as part of the host system, or may be included in a memory card that is removably insertable into a mating socket of host systems. Such a card may include the entire memory system, or the controller and memory array, with associated peripheral circuits, may be provided in separate cards.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example structure of the memory cell array <b>1</b> is described. A flash EEPROM of a NAND type is described as an example. The memory cells (M) are partitioned into a number of blocks, 1,024 in a specific example. The data stored in each block are simultaneously erased. The block is thus the minimum unit of a number of cells that are simultaneously erasable. In each block, there are N columns, N=8,512 in this example, that are divided into left columns and right columns, as described in further U.S. Pat. No. 6,522,580. The bit lines are also divided into left bit lines (BLL) and right bit lines (BLR). Four memory cells connected to the word lines (WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>) at each gate electrode are connected in series to form a NAND cell unit. One terminal of the NAND cell unit is connected to corresponding bit line (BL) via a first select transistor (S) which gate electrode is coupled to a first (Drain) select gate line (SGD), and another terminal is connected to the c-source via a second (Source) select transistor (S) which gate electrode is coupled to a second select gate line (SGS). Although four floating gate transistors are shown to be included in each cell unit, for simplicity, other numbers of transistors, such as 8, 16, or even 32, are used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes a connection, C-p-well, for supplying the well voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In each block, in this example, 8,512 columns are divided into even columns and odd columns. The bit lines are also divided into even bit lines (BLe) and odd bit lines (BLo).

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an alternate set of embodiments, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/086,495, filed Feb. 27, 2002, which is hereby incorporated by reference, the array can be divided into left and right portions instead of the odd-even arrangement. The left and right sides may additionally have independent well structures with the right and left sides of the array each formed over such separate well structures, allowing the voltage levels to be set independently by the c-p-well control circuit <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In a further variation, this could also allow erasure of a sub-block of less than all of the partitions of a block.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the exemplary embodiments, the page size is 512 bytes, which is smaller than the cell numbers on the same word line. This page size is based on user preference and convention. Allowing the word line size to correspond to more than one page's worth of cells saves the X-decoder (row control circuit <b>3</b>) space since different pages worth of data can share the decoders. During a user data read and programming operation, N=4,256 cells (M) are simultaneously selected in this example. The cells (M) selected have the same word line (WL), for example WL<b>2</b>, and the same kind of bit line (BL). Therefore, 532 bytes of data can be read or programmed simultaneously. This 532B data simultaneously read or programmed forms a “page” logically. Therefore, one block can store at least eight pages. When each memory cell (M) stores two bits of data, namely a multi-level cell, one block stores 16 pages in the case of two bit per cell storage. In this embodiment, the storage element of each of the memory cells, in this case the floating gate of each of the memory cells, stores two bits of user data.</p>

At a surface of a p-type semiconductor substrate <b>9</b>, a p-type region c-p-well <b>11</b> is formed, each of the left and right c-p-wells being enclosed by an n-type region <b>10</b> to electrically isolate the c-p-wells from the p-type substrate. The n-type region <b>10</b> is connected to a c-p-well line made of a first metal M<b>0</b> via a first contact hole (CB) and an n-type diffusion layer <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The exemplary embodiment uses Flash EEPROM storage units, where each memory cell has a floating gate (FG) that stores an amount of electric charge corresponding to the data being stored in the cell, the word line (WL) forming the gate electrode, and drain and source electrodes made of the p-type diffusion layer <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">U.S. Pat. No. 6,522,580, that is incorporated by reference above describes the varoius voltages applied to operate the memory cell array <b>1</b>, in a specific example, each memory cell's floating gate storing two bits, having one of the states “11”, “10”, “01”, “00”. This is reviewed briefly here for the case where the word line “WL<b>2</b>” and the bit lines of “BLe” are selected for erase, reading or programming. By raising the c-p-well to an erase voltage of V<sub>erase</sub>=15-20V and grounding the word lines (WL) of a selected block, the data of the selected block is erased. Since all of the word lines (WL) of the unselected blocks, bit lines (BL), select lines (SG) and c-source are put in a floating state, these are also raised to almost V<sub>erase </sub>due to a capacitive coupling with the c-p-well. Therefore, a strong electric field is applied to only the tunnel oxide films <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) of the selected memory cells (M), and the data of the selected memory cells are erased as a tunnel current flows across the tunnel oxide film <b>14</b>. The erased cell is, in this example, one of the four possible programmed states, namely “11”.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The high voltage values used in the erase and programming values can be generated from the lower supply values using a charge pump (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).

The use and location of the high voltage source is discussed more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 6,282,130, which is hereby incorporated by reference, and additional references cited therein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically illustrates such a prior art arrangement.

The c-p-well control circuit <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides the voltage for the well structure c-p-well <b>11</b>. The word lines then continue on over the well structure <b>11</b> to any of the various word lines of the different blocks of memory <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In a erase process, with word line WL<sub>C </sub>corresponding to a selected word line and WL<sub>A </sub>and WL<sub>B </sub>both non-selected, the voltage in the c-p-well is raised to the erase voltage of, say, 17 volts and line <b>107</b> is set to ground.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to store electrons in the floating gate (FG) during a programming operation, the selected word line WL<b>2</b> is connected to a program pulse Vpgrn and the selected bit lines BLe are grounded.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the read and verify operations, the select gates (SGD and SGS) and the unselected word lines (WL<b>0</b>, WL<b>1</b> and WL<b>3</b>) are raised to a read pass voltage of 4.5V to make these as pass gates. The selected word line (WL<b>2</b>) is connected to a voltage level specified for each read and verify operation in order to determine whether a threshold voltage of the concerned memory cell has reached such level. For example, in a READ <b>10</b> operation, the selected word line WL<b>2</b> is grounded, so that it is detected whether the threshold voltage is higher than 0V. In this read case, it can be said that a read level is 0V. In a VERIFY <b>01</b> operation, the selected word line WL<b>2</b> is connected to 2.4V, so that it is verified that whether the threshold voltage has reached 2.4V.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The selected bit lines (BLe) are pre-charged to a high level, for example 0.7V. If the threshold voltage is higher than the read or verify level, the potential level of the concerned bit line (BLe) maintains the high level, because of the non-conductive memory cell (M). On the other hand, If the threshold voltage is lower than the read or verify level, the potential level of the concerned bit line (BLe) decreases to a low level, for example less than 0.5V, because of the conductive memory cell (M). Further details of the read and verify operations are explained below.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Examples of Write/erase Abort Detection Mechanisms</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A principal aspect of the present invention are techniques to ensure reliable mechanisms for write and erase abort detection in the event of lost of power during memory programming and erasing with minimized system performance penalty. When a specific embodiment is used for reference, he present invention will mainly be described in terms of the Flash type memory with a NAND architecture as described in the preceding section, although the ideas extend more generally as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">One method known for preventing write abort is to add extra hardware to preserve memory Vdd until the memory operation is complete, such as is as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,418,752 that is hereby incorporated by this reference. In a variation, an alternate form of non-volatile memory with a faster write time can be used to store data which would be lost in a power loss situation. This approach has the disadvantages as it can be relatively costly and is not always readily implemented. Another method of write abort detection is to denote the address of the intended programming sector in the reserved area both before the actual programming operation and after the actual programming occurred in order to update the reserved area again to acknowledge the completion of programming operation. Including the actual programming of the data, this method will require three programming operations for every single sector write by the user. Another method is to write the predefined write abort header after the sector is programmed. This method will require two programming operations for every sector written. As for erase, one can write the address of the block or sector to be erased in a reserved area before erasing and write the address again to the reserved area after erase operation is completed. The main aspects of the present invention improve upon these techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">More specifically, to ensure a write abort failure can be reliably detected with minimal performance impact, a new write abort detection mechanism is introduced. In its exemplary embodiment, the algorithm introduces a Previous Sector Status flag (PSS) and a Last Sector Status flag (LSS) in the sector overhead information. Assuming the system is writing sectors <b>0</b> to x in a block, the algorithm will write the PSS of sector <b>1</b> along with the data in sector <b>1</b> to denote sector <b>0</b> has completed programming and no write abort occurred. This allows the PSS flag to be protected by ECC, either the ECC for the whole sector including the overhead or the overhead ECC in embodiments that have this feature. Similarly, when the sector <b>2</b> is written, its PSS will be written to indicate that sector <b>1</b> completed programming without a write abort, and so on until the last sector of the write command is reached. When the last sector, sector x, is reached it will similarly have the PSS flag corresponding to sector (x−1) entered at the same time the sector x data is entered; as the last sector in the write, however, there will be no next sector in which to set a PSS flag corresponding the sector x. To account for this, the LSS flag is used. The LSS flag of a sector corresponds to the sector itself and indicates that the sector that contains it completed programming without a write abort.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">After sector x is programmed, the algorithm can program LSS of sector x. This means only the last sector in the host program command requires two programming operation to ensure write abort detection. The PSS scheme is applied for all sectors within a host atomic write command or a group of commands cached by the controller. The LSS scheme applies to the last sector of the host atomic write command and the last physical page of a block if out of sequence page programming is not allowed. The memory system can determine the number of sectors to be programmed from the host command and, by utilizing host caching to manage the write operation with PSS and LSS, minimize system performance impact. For example, the controller can group multiple host atomic writes into one sequence of memory operation, thereby amortizing the overhead of writing LSS over a large chuck of sector and hence reducing the performance impact. These mechanisms ensure write abort failure detection by looking at the PSS of the next physical sector and at the LSS of the current sector if the sector is the last programmed sector in the block or the last physical sector of the block.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For erase, an erase abort flag (EAF) can be marked after a successful erase operation. The EAF flag can be placed in a pre-specified location, such as in the first sector of the block. Note that for both the PSS flag and the EAF flag (when a block contains more than a single sector), an indication of a successful operation in one sector is being maintained in another sector. With these flags, the system can successful detect a write abort or an erase abort during next initialization of next power on. These abort detection schemes are especially effective for multi-state (MLC) memories as it is more difficult and costly to design hardware to handle MLC due to the longer programming and erasing times required, and as the performance gained from not programming twice on every single sector is much greater on MLC also due to the typically longer programming time requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The exemplary embodiment employs the PSS and LSS flags on a sector level basis. This is often convenient as a sector is the smallest data unit the host works with. More generally, a PSS and LSS flag can be set for each successful write for amounts of data, typically based on some physical data unit or structure. For example, when the unit of data writing is a multi-sector data page, the successful programming of a page of data can be recorded in the PSS flag programmed concurrently with the next page, with a LSS flag then being set for the successful write of the last page. Although the present discussion of the exemplary embodiments is in terms of sectors—and the flag names include “sector”—, these embodiments can all be extended to the more general situation. Similarly, although the EAF flag for the exemplary embodiment is used on the block level, as this is the unit of erase, more generally it could also used on a different scale, such as a single erase flag for a meta-block.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A pair of exemplary embodiments are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-C</figref>, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6C</figref> showing the structure of a sector and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> describing the various fields. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> represents a number n of blocks from memory array <b>1</b>, where these run from block i <b>601</b> to block i+n <b>603</b>. Within each block is shown a number of sectors, such as <b>631</b> and <b>633</b>, each represented by a row in the figure. The various fields are described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The various parts of a generic sector are noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. These consist of a data portion <b>611</b> where user data is stored and a header or overhead portion <b>623</b>, which contains various data about the sector such as the corresponding error correction code (ECC) <b>615</b> and other sorts of overhead (Other <b>613</b>) known in the art. The ECC may be for both the data and overhead or there may be a separate ECC for each. Although for exposition purposes the various fields are shown segregated in these Figures, in practice they may be intermingled in the actual storage elements. Additional, there are also embodiments where the overhead is stored separately, with physical sectors containing only data and other physical locations dedicated to overhead. The new features are the inclusion of the flags PSS <b>617</b>, LSS <b>619</b>, and EAF <b>621</b> in the overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, each sector has both a PSS flag <b>617</b>, which can be set to indicate that the previous sector was successfully written, and a LSS flag <b>619</b>, which can be set to indicate that the sector itself has been correctly written. As discussed below, each of these flags can consist of multiple bits. As the status of the PSS flag known before the sector is written, it is written concurrently with the data and overhead content and can be ECC protected. As the LSS flag is written subsequently, being dependent on the rest of the sector being successfully written, it will not be ECC protected, the ECC having been previous written.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the contents of a block are all erased together, the exemplary embodiment can employ only a single erase abort flag for each block, EAF <b>621</b>. The present invention adopts the convention that the EAF flag, which again can consist of multiple bits, is placed in the first sector of the block, such as sector <b>631</b> in block Block i <b>601</b>. After an erase process is successfully completed, the EAF is set. Consequently, in the exemplary embodiment, the EAF flag should be set at all times. The only time it is not set is when an erase abort occurred where the operation to set the EAF flag did not occur after erase operation. As it will have already been set before data is written to the block, it will not be ECC protected. (If it is desired to have the EAF flag ECC protected, it would need to be erased and then rewritten with the data, incurring additional programming overhead.) Although the preferred embodiment includes both EAF flags for erase abort detection and PSS/LSS flags for write abort detection, it should be noted that these are independent aspects of the invention and can be independently incorporated into a memory device.</p>

The data portion <b>611</b> can store either user data, as supplied from the host, or system data, examples of which are described in International patent publication WO 03/027828 A1, which is hereby incorporate by this reference.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The EAF flags <b>621</b> are set in the blocks as the blocks have previously been successfully erased without an erase abort occurring. The first written sector, <b>631</b>, will have neither its PSS flag <b>617</b> nor its LSS flag <b>619</b> set. The next sector <b>633</b> will have its PSS flag <b>617</b> set indicating that preceding sector <b>631</b> was successfully written. Similarly, each succeeding sector, up to and including the last sector <b>639</b> of the write, will have its PSS flag set. The last written sector will additionally have its LSS flag <b>619</b> set, and be the only sector of the autonomous write process to have this flag set. (The situation of a sector having its LSS flag set, but its PSS flag unset, would occur if only the single sector is written.)</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart of the exemplary write process. This begins at step <b>701</b> with the write command for writing multiple logical sectors of data. The first logical sector is then written into the corresponding physical sector (<b>703</b>). After the data is verified as correctly entered (<b>705</b>), the process continues on to the next sector. When the data content is written into the next sector (<b>707</b>), the PSS flag is also set in its overhead area to indicate that the previous sector was correctly programmed. The write is verified at step <b>709</b>. If this is not the last sector (<b>711</b>, “NO”), the write process continues on to the next sector and repeats steps <b>707</b> and <b>709</b>, again setting the PSS flag in step <b>707</b> in response to step <b>709</b> in the preceding loop. Once the last sector is written and confirmed (<b>711</b>, “YES”), since there is no next sector in which to set the PSS flag, the LSS flag is set in the last sector. The order in which sectors are written within a block, and the order in which blocks are written in an atomic write process may be fixed or variable, for example based on a pointer structure as in U.S. patent publication US 2003/0065899, which is hereby incorporated by reference. (If the order is not fixed, it will need to be maintained in order to determine which sector is the preceding sector corresponding to the PSS flag. As memories with a NAND architecture use a sequential sector write, the sequential write of sectors used in the scheme of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a consequence.)</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, to determine whether a write process was successful, only the PSS <b>617</b> and LSS <b>619</b> flags need to be checked. These flags can be used as a guarantee that the sectors were successful written. If the LSS flag of a sector is set, it and all of the preceding sectors of the write process were successfully programmed. For example, if there was a power loss during a write process, the flags can be scanned: if the LSS flag <b>619</b> is set, the programming was completed; if the LSS flag <b>619</b> is not set, by working backwards through the PSS flags <b>617</b>, the first set PSS flag will indicate that all of the sectors in the write process were successfully written before the power was lost. Similarly, checking the EAF flag <b>621</b> allows for the determination that an erase process was successfully completed without having to check the data content of the entire block. It also allows the system to distinguish a block containing all valid data that just happens to be all zeros (which could also be determined by the PSS and LSS flags), and a block that is actually erased.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> is a variation on the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> that may be preferable in many applications. In this embodiment, when a complete block is written, the LSS flag is set for the last sector written in the block even when the write continues on to more sectors in other blocks. Consequently, the LSS flag of sector <b>635</b> is set in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. As the successful write of sector <b>635</b> is recorded in sector <b>635</b> itself, it is not necessary to set the PSS flag in the next written sector, which will be the first sector in another block. Thus, sector <b>637</b> does not have its PSS flag set even though the preceding sector was successfully written, this being indicated by the LSS flag of the last sector in the preceding block. As the first sector in each block will consequently never need to have its PSS flag set, this flag can be eliminated for these sectors, as is shown for sectors <b>631</b> and <b>637</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. As these bits in sector <b>0</b>, they can be used for EAF flag. Consequently, although the EAF flag <b>621</b> is shown as distinct in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the area which would be used for PSS in the other sectors is available for EAF in sector <b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> has the advantage that the status of all of the sectors in a block can be checked just by looking at the LSS flag of the last sector in the block. It also has the advantage the all of the sectors within a block will have the same number of data bits, as sector <b>0</b> is not required to have both a EAF and a PSS flag.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> will be changed slightly in that in step <b>707</b> the PSS flag will not be set if the current sector is the first sector of a block. It will need to set LSS between steps <b>709</b> and <b>711</b> for the last sector of the block.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Considering the structure of the flags, these may be single bit flags or multi-bit flags. This is a design choice and is a tradeoff the robustness of the flags and the amount of space used. There is also the consideration that as the number bits in the flags increase, so does the probability of a bad bit or write error in the flag itself, which, as the purpose of the flags is to determine whether the data write was successful, becomes counter productive if the flag itself faces an increased risk of error. The exemplary embodiment uses flags of a few bits each, roughly matching the ECC used. Additionally, for added robustness, the flags may be stored in binary mode, even in a multi-state memory. As the PSS flag is set during the same MLC program operation as the actual data, using binary flags can complicate the programming algorithms somewhat and is also not needed in most applications as multi-bit flags can be used. In the exemplary embodiment described above, with the upper page/lower page, the flags are also preferably stored in a multi-level manner corresponding to an upper page flag and a lover age flag in order to reduce operating complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As noted above, the present invention is applicable not just to the NAND type of flash memory of the exemplary embodiment, but to other architectures and memory technology. For example, other EEPROM or charge storing cells could benefit, e.g. a NOR type flash memory with well erase. It can similarly be extended to where the storage element is not a floating gate transistor, for example the dielectric storage element of the kind described in the U.S. patent application entitled “Multi-State Non-Volatile Integrated Circuit Memory Systems That Employ Dielectric Storage Elements”, by Eliyahou Harari, George Samachisa, Jack H. Yuan, and Daniel C. Guterman, filed Oct. 25, 2002, which is hereby incorporated by this reference. And although the discussion so far has focused on embodiments using a charge storing device, such as floating gate EEPROM or FLASH cells, for the memory device, it can be applied to other embodiments, for example NROM and MNOS cells, such as those respectively described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,768,192 of Eitan and U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,086 of Sato et al., or magnetic RAM and FRAM cells, such as those respectively described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,193 of Gallagher et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,706 of Shimizu et al., all of which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference, could also be used.</p>
