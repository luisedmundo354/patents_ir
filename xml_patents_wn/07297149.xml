<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates broadly to surgical devices, and in particular to methods and devices for applying surgical clips to ducts, vessels, shunts, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years surgery has markedly advanced through the performance of laparoscopic and endoscopic surgical procedures such as cholecystectomies, gastrostomies, appendectomies, and hernia repair. These procedures are accomplished through a trocar assembly, which is a surgical instrument used to puncture a body cavity. The trocar typically contains a sharpened obturator tip and a trocar tube or cannula. The trocar cannula is inserted into the skin to access the body cavity, by using the obturator tip to penetrate the skin. After penetration, the obturator is removed and the trocar cannula remains in the body. It is through this cannula that surgical instruments are placed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One surgical instrument that is commonly used with a trocar cannula is a surgical clip applier for ligating a blood vessel, a duct, shunt, or a portion of body tissue during surgery. Most clip appliers typically have a handle with an elongate shaft having a pair of movable opposed jaws formed on an end thereof for holding and forming a ligation clip therebetween. The jaws are positioned around the vessel or duct, and the clip is crushed or formed on the vessel by the closing of the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many of the prior art clip appliers, the feeding and forming mechanisms require precise timing and coordinated movement of components to operate. This need for precise timing and control has resulted in the need for complex mechanical designs, thereby increasing the cost of the clip appliers. Many prior art clip appliers also use a spring-loaded clip advancing assembly to advance one or more clips through the shaft of the device. As a result, the jaws must contain a mechanism for preventing accidental projection of the clip from the device before the clip is formed. Other drawbacks of current clip appliers include the inability to handle an overload applied to the jaws by the trigger under a variety of conditions. Many devices require full closure of the jaws, which can result in overload on the jaws when the vessel or duct positioned therebetween is too large to allow full closure, or when a foreign object is positioned between the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there remains a need for improved methods and devices for applying surgical clips to vessels, ducts, shunts, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides method and devices for applying a surgical clip to a vessel, duct, shunt, etc. In one exemplary embodiment, a surgical clip applier is provided having a housing with a trigger movably coupled thereto and an elongate shaft extending therefrom with opposed jaws formed on a distal end thereof. The trigger is adapted to advance a clip to position the clip between the jaws, and to move the jaws from an open position to a closed position to crimp the clip positioned therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The surgical clip applier can have a variety of configurations, and it can include a variety of features to facilitate advancement and formation of a surgical clip. In one embodiment, the surgical clip applier can include a feeder shoe that is slidably disposed within the elongate shaft and that is adapted to drive at least one surgical clip through the elongate shaft. In an exemplary embodiment, the feeder shoe can be adapted to move only in a distal direction, such that proximal movement of the feeder shoe is substantially prevented. The elongate shaft can also include a clip track disposed therein and adapted to seat at least one surgical clip. The feeder shoe can be slidably disposed within the clip track.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A variety of techniques can be used to facilitate distal movement and prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe. In one exemplary embodiment, the feeder shoe can include a tang adapted to engage the clip track to prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe within the clip track, yet allow distal movement of the feeder shoe within the clip track. The clip track can include several openings formed therein for receiving the tang to prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe within the clip track. In another exemplary embodiment, the feeder shoe can include a tang and the feed bar can include several detents formed therein and adapted to engage the tang to move the feeder shoe distally when the feed bar is moved distally.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the elongate shaft can include a feed bar slidably disposed therein and coupled to the trigger such that movement of the trigger toward a closed position is adapted to advance the feed bar distally thereby advancing the feeder shoe distally. By way of non-limiting example, the feed bar can be coupled to the trigger by a trigger insert that is mated to the trigger, and by a link that extends between the trigger insert and the proximal end of the feed bar. The proximal end of the feed bar can include a coupler that is adapted to receive a portion of the link. The feed bar can also include a distal end having an advancer that is adapted to engage a distal-most clip and to drive the distal-most clip into the jaws. In certain exemplary embodiments, the feed bar can be adapted to engage and initiate advancement of a distal-most clip into the jaws prior to initiating advancement of the feeder shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a clip advancing assembly for advancing a clip through a surgical clip applier is provided. The clip advancing assembly can be used with a variety of surgical clip appliers, including those known in the art. In one exemplary embodiment, the clip advancing assembly can include a clip track that is adapted to seat at least one clip, and a feeder shoe that is adapted to slidably mate to the clip track and to move in a distal direction to move at least one clip disposed within the clip track in a distal direction. The feeder shoe can include, in one exemplary embodiment, a tang that is adapted to engage the clip track to prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe within the clip track, and that is adapted to allow distal movement of the feeder shoe within the clip track. The clip track can include a plurality of openings formed therein for receiving the tang to prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe within the clip track.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The clip advancing assembly can also include a feed bar that is adapted to couple to a movable trigger formed on a housing of a surgical clip applier and that is adapted to slidably move distally when the trigger is closed to advance the feeder shoe and at least one clip disposed within the clip track. The feed bar can have a variety of configurations, and in one exemplary embodiment the distal end of the feed bar can include an advancer that is adapted to engage a distal-most clip to drive the distal-most clip from the clip track into jaws formed on a distal end of a surgical clip applier. In another exemplary embodiment, the feeder shoe can include a tang, and the feed bar can include a plurality of detents formed therein that are adapted to engage the tang to move the feeder shoe distally when the feed bar is moved distally. In use, the proximal end of the feed bar can include a coupler that is adapted to receive a link for coupling the feed bar to a trigger of a surgical clip applier.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An exemplary method for advancing a surgical clip through an elongate shaft of a surgical clip applier is also provided. In one embodiment, a feed bar can be distally advanced within an elongate shaft of a surgical clip applier to distally drive a feeder shoe disposed within the elongate shaft and thereby distally advance at least one clip. The feed bar can be distally advanced by, for example, actuating a trigger coupled to a housing that is mated to a proximal end of the elongate shaft. In one exemplary embodiment, when the feed bar is distally advanced, an advancer on the distal end of the feed bar can engage a distal-most clip and advance the clip between opposed jaws formed on a distal end of the elongate shaft. The method can also include proximally retracting the feed bar within the elongate shaft while the feeder shoe is maintained in a substantially fixed position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another exemplary embodiment, a method for applying a surgical clip is provided and includes moving a trigger coupled to a housing a first distance toward a closed position to actuate a clip advancing assembly disposed within the housing, thereby advancing a clip into a jaw assembly formed on a distal end of the elongate shaft, and further moving the trigger a second distance toward the closed position to actuate a clip forming assembly disposed within the housing, thereby forming the clip disposed within the jaw assembly. The trigger is preferably pliant relative to the clip advancing assembly during actuation of the clip forming assembly. The clip forming assembly can also be pliant relative to the jaw assembly during actuation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other aspects, an overload mechanism is provided for use with a surgical device. In one exemplary embodiment, the overload mechanism can include a force-receiving member pivotally and slidably disposed in a housing and having a surface with a first end and an opposed second end, and a biasing assembly disposed in the housing and adapted to resist movement of the force-receiving member. In an exemplary embodiment, the resistance increases from the first end to the second end.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The force-receiving member can have a variety of configurations, but in one embodiment the force-receiving surface formed thereon is positioned within an opening in the housing. The force-receiving surface can include a first portion that is adapted to receive a force for pivotally moving the force-receiving member within the housing, and a second portion that is adapted to receive a force for slidably moving the force-receiving member within the housing. The biasing assembly can also have a variety of configurations, but in one exemplary embodiment the biasing assembly can include a spring disposed around a spring post, and a plunger slidably disposed relative to the spring post and having a head formed thereon and adapted to compress the spring upon slidable movement of the plunger toward the spring post.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the housing can include a pivoting assembly that is coupled between the force-receiving member and the biasing assembly such that pivoting assembly is adapted to transfer a force applied to the force-receiving member to the biasing assembly to overcome the resistance. In one exemplary embodiment, the pivoting assembly can include a toggle link that is pivotally coupled to the force-receiving member, and a pivot link that is pivotally coupled to the toggle link and that is adapted to apply a force to the biasing assembly upon pivotal movement thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, a surgical clip applier is provided having an overload mechanism for preventing overload of a closing force applied to jaws of the clip applier. In one exemplary embodiment, the surgical clip applier can include a housing having a trigger movably coupled thereto, an elongate shaft extending from the housing with opposed jaws formed on a distal end thereof and movable between an open position and a closed position, and a camming assembly disposed within the housing and the elongate shaft and coupled to the trigger. The camming assembly can be adapted to apply a closing force to the jaws upon actuation of the trigger to move the jaws from the open position toward the closed position. The camming assembly can also be adapted to transfer the closing force to an overload mechanism disposed within the housing when the closing force is greater than a resistance of the overload mechanism that is applied to the camming assembly. In an exemplary embodiment, the resistance of the overload mechanism correlates to a force required to move the jaws from the open position toward the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While various techniques can be used to couple the camming assembly to the overload mechanism, in one exemplary embodiment the camming assembly moves relative to a force-receiving surface of the overload mechanism such that the closing force of the camming assembly is applied across the force-receiving surface of the overload mechanism as the trigger is actuated to cause the camming assembly to move the jaws from the open position toward the closed position. The force-receiving surface of the overload mechanism can be adapted to resist movement in a proximal direction and the resistance can increase as the trigger is actuated to cause the camming assembly to move relative to the force-receiving surface and to move the jaws from the open position toward the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another exemplary embodiment, the overload mechanism can include a housing having a profile link slidably and pivotally disposed therein and having the force-receiving surface formed thereon and positioned adjacent to an opening formed in the housing. The force-receiving surface can include a first portion that is adapted to receive a force for pivotally moving the force-receiving member within the housing, and a second portion that is adapted to receive a force for slidably moving the force-receiving member within the housing. The overload mechanism can also include a biasing assembly that is adapted to apply a resistance to the profile link. In one exemplary embodiment, the biasing assembly can be coupled to the profile link by a pivoting assembly that is adapted to pivot upon pivotal movement of the profile link, and that is adapted to slide upon slidable movement of the profile link to apply a force to the biasing assembly to overcome the resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Methods for applying a surgical clip applier having an overload mechanism are also provided. In one exemplary embodiment, a closing force can be applied to a pair of opposed jaws formed on a surgical clip applier. The closing force can be effective to move the opposed jaws from an open position to a closed position. When the closing force is greater than a threshold force of an overload mechanism, the closing force is transferred to the overload mechanism disposed within the surgical clip applier. In an exemplary embodiment, the threshold force of the overload mechanism increases as the jaws are moved from an open position toward the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the overload mechanism can have a variety of configurations, in one embodiment the overload mechanism can include a force-receiving element that is adapted to receive the closing force, and a biasing assembly that is adapted to resist movement of the force-receiving element in response to the closing force. The surgical clip applier can include a camming assembly that is adapted to apply the closing force to the jaws, and that includes a roller member that rolls across the force-receiving element as the closing force is applied to the jaws. The threshold force of the overload mechanism can increase as the roller member rolls across the force-receiving element. In particular, when the roller member rolls across a first portion of the force-receiving element, the force-receiving elements can pivot if the closing force is greater than the threshold force, and when the roller member rolls across a second portion of the force-receiving element, the force-receiving element can slide if the closing force is greater than the threshold force. In an exemplary embodiment, the threshold force required to pivot the force-receiving element is less than the threshold force required to slide the force-receiving element.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In other aspects, a surgical clip applier is provided and it can include a clip advancing assembly coupled to a trigger and adapted to advance at least one surgical clip through an elongate shaft extending from a housing, and a clip forming assembly coupled to a trigger and adapted to actuate a jaw assembly formed on a distal end of the elongate shaft to form a surgical clip. The trigger can be coupled to the housing and adapted to actuate the clip advancing assembly and the clip forming assembly. In an exemplary embodiment, the trigger has two sequential stages of actuation. The trigger can be effective to actuate the clip advancing assembly during the first stage of actuation, and it can be effective to actuate the clip forming assembly during the second stage of actuation while being pliant relative to the clip advancing assembly.</p>

The elongate shaft <b>18</b> can be rotatably coupled to the housing <b>12</b>, and it can include a rotation knob <b>22</b> for rotating the shaft <b>18</b> relative to the housing <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the surgical clip applier <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and the various components will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A–12</figref> illustrate exemplary embodiments of the various components of the shaft <b>18</b> of the surgical clip applier <b>10</b>. In general, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the shaft <b>18</b> includes an outer tube <b>24</b> that houses the shaft components, which can include a jaw retaining assembly <b>26</b> having a jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> with a clip track <b>30</b> and a push rod channel <b>32</b> formed thereon. The jaws <b>20</b> can be configured to mate to a distal end of the clip track <b>30</b>. The shaft assembly <b>18</b> can also include a clip advancing assembly, which in one exemplary embodiment can include a feeder shoe <b>34</b> that is adapted to be slidably disposed within the clip track <b>30</b> to advance a series of clips <b>36</b> positioned therein, and a feed bar <b>38</b> that is adapted to drive the feeder shoe <b>34</b> through the clip track <b>30</b>. The feed bar <b>38</b> can include an advancer assembly <b>40</b> that is adapted to mate to a distal end thereof for advancing a distal-most clip into the jaws <b>20</b>. The shaft assembly <b>18</b> can also include a clip forming or camming assembly, which in one exemplary embodiment can include a cam <b>42</b> that is adapted to slidably mate to the jaws <b>20</b>, and a push rod <b>44</b> that can couple to the cam <b>42</b> to move the cam <b>42</b> relative to the jaws <b>20</b>. The shaft assembly can also include a tissue stop <b>46</b> that can mate to a distal end of the clip track <b>30</b> for facilitating positioning of the jaws <b>20</b> relative to a surgical site.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The various components of one exemplary clip advancing assembly are shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A–5</figref>. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A–2D</figref>, the jaw retaining assembly <b>26</b> is shown and it includes an elongate, substantially planar jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> having a proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>that mates to the outer tube <b>24</b>, and a distal end <b>28</b><i>b </i>that is adapted to mate to the jaws <b>20</b>. While a variety of techniques can be used to mate the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> to the outer tube <b>24</b>, in the illustrated embodiment the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>includes teeth <b>31</b> formed on opposed sides thereof that are adapted to be received within corresponding holes or openings (not shown) formed in the outer tube <b>24</b>, and a cut-out <b>29</b> formed therein that allows the opposed sides of the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>to deflect or to form a spring. In particular, the cut-out <b>29</b> allows the opposed sides of the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> to be compressed toward one another when the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> is inserted in the outer tube <b>24</b>. Once the teeth <b>31</b> are aligned with the corresponding openings in the outer tube <b>24</b>, the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> will return to its original, uncompressed configuration thereby causing the teeth <b>31</b> to extend into the corresponding openings to engage the outer <b>24</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the device can also include a feature to prevent compression of the opposed sides of the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> during use of the device to prevent accidental disengagement of the teeth <b>31</b> from the outer tube <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A variety of techniques can also be used to mate the distal end <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> to the jaws <b>20</b>, however in the illustrated embodiment the distal end <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> includes several cut-outs or teeth <b>78</b> formed therein for mating with corresponding protrusions or teeth <b>94</b> formed on the jaws <b>20</b>, which will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The teeth <b>78</b> allow a proximal portion of the jaws <b>20</b> to be substantially co-planar with the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The jaw retaining assembly <b>26</b> can also include a push rod channel <b>32</b> formed thereon for slidably receiving the push rod <b>44</b>, which is used to advanced the cam <b>42</b> over the jaws <b>20</b>, as will be discussed in more detail below. The push rod channel <b>32</b> can be formed using a variety of techniques, and it can have any shape and size depending on the shape and size of the push rod <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the push rod channel <b>32</b> is fixedly attached, e.g., by welding, to a superior surface of the retainer shaft <b>28</b>, and it has a substantially rectangular shape and defines a pathway <b>32</b><i>a </i>extending therethrough. The push rod channel <b>32</b> can also extend along all or only a portion of the retainer shaft <b>28</b>. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the jaw retaining assembly <b>26</b> does not need to include a push rod channel <b>32</b> for facilitating movement of the push rod <b>44</b> within the elongate shaft <b>18</b> of the surgical clip applier <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A–2D</figref>, the jaw retaining assembly <b>26</b> can also include a clip track <b>30</b> mated thereto or formed thereon. The clip track <b>30</b> is shown mated to an inferior surface of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>, and it extends distally beyond the distal end <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> to allow a distal end <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the clip track <b>30</b> to be substantially aligned with the jaws <b>20</b>. In use, the clip track <b>30</b> is configured to seat at least one, and preferably a series, of clips therein. Accordingly, the clip track <b>30</b> can include opposed side rails <b>80</b><i>a, </i><b>80</b><i>b </i>that are adapted to seat opposed legs of one or more clips therein, such that the legs of the clips are axially aligned with one another. In an exemplary embodiment, the clip track <b>30</b> can be configured to seat about twenty clips that are pre-disposed within the clip track <b>30</b> during manufacturing. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the shape, size, and configuration of the clip track <b>30</b> can vary depending on the shape, size, and configuration of clips, or other closure devices such as staples, adapted to be received therein. Moreover, a variety of other techniques can be used, instead of a clip track <b>30</b>, to retain a clip supply with the elongate shaft <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The clip track <b>30</b> can also include several openings <b>30</b><i>c </i>formed therein for receiving a tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>formed on a feeder shoe <b>34</b> adapted to be disposed within the clip track <b>30</b>, as will be discussed in more detail below. In an exemplary embodiment, the clip track <b>30</b> includes a quantity of openings <b>30</b><i>c </i>that corresponds to at least the number of clips adapted to be pre-disposed within the device <b>10</b> and applied during use. The openings <b>30</b><i>c </i>are preferably equidistant from one another to ensure that the tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> engages an opening <b>30</b><i>c </i>each time the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is advanced. While not shown, the clip track <b>30</b> can include detents, rather than openings <b>30</b><i>c, </i>or it can include other features that allow the clip track <b>30</b> to engage the feeder shoe <b>34</b> and prevent distal movement, yet allow proximal movement, of the feeder shoe <b>34</b>. The clip track <b>30</b> can also include a stop tang <b>118</b> formed thereon, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, that is effective to be engaged by a corresponding stop tang formed on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> to prevent movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> beyond a distal-most position, as will be discussed below. The stop tang <b>118</b> can have a variety of configurations, but in one exemplary embodiment it is in the form of two adjacent tabs that extend toward one another to enclose a portion of the clip track, thus allowing clips to pass therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">An exemplary feeder shoe <b>34</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, and it can be adapted to directly driving clips through the clip track <b>30</b>. While the feeder shoe <b>34</b> can have a variety of configurations, and a variety of other techniques can be used to drive clips through the clip track <b>30</b>, in an exemplary embodiment the feeder shoe <b>34</b> has a generally elongate shape with proximal and distal ends <b>34</b><i>a, </i><b>34</b><i>b. </i>The distal end <b>34</b><i>b </i>can be adapted to cradle the proximal-most clip in the clip track <b>30</b> to push the clip(s) through the clip track <b>30</b>. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the distal end <b>34</b><i>b </i>is substantially v-shaped for seating a v-shaped bight portion of a clip. The distal end <b>34</b><i>b </i>also includes a rectangular-shaped notch <b>34</b><i>c </i>formed therein for allowing the advancer <b>40</b> to engage a distal-most clip and advance it into the jaws <b>20</b>, as will be discussed in more detail below. The distal end <b>34</b><i>b </i>can, of course, vary depending on the configuration of the clip, or other closure mechanism, being used with the device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In another exemplary embodiment, the feeder shoe <b>34</b> can also include features to facilitate distal movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> within the clip track <b>30</b>, and to substantially prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> within the clip track <b>30</b>. Such a configuration will ensure advancement and proper positioning of the clips within the clip track <b>30</b>, thus allowing a distal-most clip to be advanced between the jaws <b>20</b> with each actuation of the trigger <b>16</b>, as will be discussed in more detail below. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the feeder shoe <b>34</b> includes a tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>formed on a superior surface <b>34</b><i>s </i>thereof and angled proximally for engaging one of the openings <b>30</b><i>c </i>formed in the clip track <b>30</b>. In use, the angle of the tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>allows the feeder shoe <b>34</b> to slide distally within the clip track <b>30</b>. Each time the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is advanced, the tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>will move in a distal direction from one opening <b>30</b><i>c </i>to the next opening <b>30</b><i>c </i>in the clip track <b>30</b>. The engagement of the tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>with the opening <b>30</b><i>c </i>in the clip track <b>30</b> will prevent the feeder shoe <b>34</b> from moving proximally to return to the previous position, as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In order to facilitate proximal movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> within the clip track <b>30</b>, the feeder shoe <b>34</b> can also include a tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>formed on the inferior surface <b>34</b>i thereof, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, for allowing the feeder shoe <b>34</b> to be engaged by the feed bar <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) as the feed bar <b>38</b> is moved distally. The inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>is similar to the superior tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>in that it can be angled proximally. In use, each time the feed bar <b>38</b> is moved distally, a detent <b>84</b> formed in the feed bar <b>38</b> can engage the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>and move the feeder shoe <b>34</b> distally a predetermined distance within the clip track <b>30</b>. The feed bar <b>38</b> can then be moved proximally to return to its initial position, and the angle of the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>will allow the tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>to slide into the next detent <b>84</b> formed in the feed bar <b>38</b>. As previously noted, a variety of other features rather than tangs <b>82</b><i>a, </i><b>82</b><i>b </i>and openings <b>30</b><i>c </i>or detents <b>84</b> can be used to control movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> within the clip track <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As previously mentioned, the feeder shoe <b>34</b> can also include a stop formed thereon that is adapted to stop movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> when the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is in the distal-most position and there are no clips remaining in the device <b>10</b>. While the stop can have a variety of configurations, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate a third tang <b>82</b><i>c </i>formed on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> and extending in an inferior direction for engaging the stop tang <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) formed on the clip track <b>30</b>. The third tang <b>82</b><i>c </i>is positioned such that it will engage the stop tang <b>118</b> on the clip track <b>30</b> when the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is in a distal-most position, thereby preventing movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> and the feed bar <b>38</b> when the clip supply is depleted.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an exemplary feed bar <b>38</b> for driving the feeder shoe <b>34</b> through the clip track <b>30</b> of the jaw retaining assembly <b>26</b>. As shown, the feed bar <b>38</b> has a generally elongate shape with proximal and distal ends <b>38</b><i>a, </i><b>38</b><i>b. </i>The proximal end <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b><i>a </i>can be adapted to mate to a feed bar coupler <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), which will be discussed in more detail below. The feed bar coupler <b>50</b> can mate to a feed link <b>52</b> that is effective, upon actuation of the trigger <b>16</b>, to slidably move the feed bar <b>38</b> in a distal direction within the elongate shaft <b>18</b>. The distal end <b>38</b><i>b </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b><i>b </i>can be adapted to mate to an advancer <b>40</b>, <b>40</b>′, exemplary embodiments of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, that is effective to drive a distal-most clip disposed within the clip track <b>30</b> into the jaws <b>20</b>, which will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As previously mentioned, the proximal end <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b> can include a feature to prevent compression of the opposed sides of the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>) during use of the device to prevent accidental disengagement of the teeth <b>31</b> from the outer tube <b>24</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A–4C</figref>, the proximal end <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b> can include a protrusion <b>39</b> formed thereon that is adapted to extend into the opening <b>29</b> formed in the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>. When the feed bar <b>38</b> is in a proximal-most position (i.e., when the trigger <b>16</b> is in an open position), the protrusion <b>39</b> will be positioned at the proximal end of the opening <b>29</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, allowing the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> to compress to allow the shaft <b>28</b> to slide into the outer tube <b>24</b>. When the feed bar <b>38</b> is in a distal-most position (i.e., when the trigger <b>16</b> is in at least a partially closed position), the protrusion <b>39</b> will be positioned at an intermediate location adjacent to the teeth <b>31</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, to prevent compression of the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>. This is particularly advantageous during use of the device, as the protrusion <b>39</b> will prevent accidental disengagement of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> from the outer tube <b>24</b> during use of the device. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A–4C</figref> illustrate a protrusion <b>39</b> having a rectangular cross-sectional shape with rounded edges, the protrusion <b>39</b> can have a variety of other shapes and sizes. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 4E</figref>, the protrusion <b>39</b>′ has a cross-sectional shape that is somewhat triangular with a tapering end that is adapted to extend between the teeth <b>31</b> to further ensure that the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> can not be compressed during use of the device. More than one protrusion can also be used. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4F–4H</figref> illustrate another embodiment in which the proximal end <b>38</b><i>a</i>′ of the feed bar <b>38</b> includes two protrusions <b>39</b><i>a, </i><b>39</b><i>b </i>formed thereon and spaced a distance apart from one another. The two protrusions <b>39</b><i>a, </i><b>39</b><i>b </i>will prevent compression of the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> when the feed bar <b>38</b> is in a proximal-most position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, and when the feed bar <b>38</b> is in a distal-most position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</figref>. Compression of the proximal end <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b> can only occur when the feed bar <b>38</b> is at an intermediate position such that the teeth <b>31</b> are positioned between the protrusions <b>39</b><i>a, </i><b>39</b><i>b, </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As was also previously mentioned, the feed bar <b>38</b> can include one or more detents <b>84</b> formed therein for engaging the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>formed on the feeder shoe <b>34</b>. The quantity of detents <b>84</b> can vary, but in an exemplary embodiment the feed bar <b>38</b> has a quantity of detents <b>84</b> that corresponds to or is greater than a quantity of clips adapted to be delivered by the device <b>10</b>, and more preferably it has one more detent <b>84</b> than the quantity of clips adapted to be delivered by the device <b>10</b>. By way of non-limiting example, the feed bar <b>38</b> can include eighteen detents <b>84</b> formed therein for delivering seventeen clips that are pre-disposed within the clip track <b>30</b>. Such a configuration allows the feed bar <b>38</b> to advance the feeder shoe <b>34</b> seventeen times, thereby advancing seventeen clips into the jaws <b>20</b> for application. The detents <b>84</b> are also preferably equidistant from one another to ensure that the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is engaged and advanced by the feed bar <b>38</b> each time the feed bar <b>38</b> is advanced.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The feed bar <b>38</b> can also include a feature to control the amount of movement of the feed bar <b>38</b> relative to the clip track <b>30</b>. Such a configuration will ensure that the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is advanced a predetermined distance each time the trigger <b>16</b> is actuated, thereby advancing only a single clip into the jaws <b>20</b>. While a variety of techniques can be used to control the distal of movement of the feed bar <b>38</b>, in an exemplary embodiment the feed bar <b>38</b> can include a protrusion <b>86</b> formed thereon that is adapted to be slidably received within a corresponding slot <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) formed in the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>. The length of the slot <b>88</b> is effective to limit movement of the protrusion <b>86</b> therein, thus limiting movement of the feed bar <b>38</b>. Accordingly, in use the feed bar <b>38</b> can slide between a fixed proximal position and a fixed distal position with respect to the clip track <b>30</b>, thereby allowing the feed bar <b>38</b> to advance the feeder shoe <b>34</b> by a predetermined distance with each advancement of the feed bar <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates one exemplary embodiment of an advancer <b>40</b> that is adapted to mate to the distal end <b>38</b><i>b </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b> and which is effective to drive a distal-most clip from the clip track <b>30</b> into the jaws <b>20</b>. A variety of techniques can be used to mate the advancer <b>40</b> to the feed bar <b>38</b>, but in the illustrated embodiment the proximal end <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the advancer <b>40</b> is in the form of a female connector that is adapted to receive the male connector formed on the distal end <b>38</b><i>b </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b>. The advancer <b>40</b> preferably fixedly mates to the feed bar <b>38</b>, however it can optionally be integrally formed with the feed bar <b>38</b>. The distal end <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b> is preferably adapted to advance a clip into the jaws <b>20</b> and thus the distal end <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the advancer <b>40</b> can include, for example, a clip-pusher member <b>90</b> formed thereon. The clip-pusher member <b>90</b> can have a variety of shapes and sizes, but in one exemplary embodiment it has an elongate shape with a recess <b>92</b> formed in the distal end thereof for seating the bight portion of a clip. The shape of the recess <b>92</b> can vary depending on the particular configuration of the clip. The clip-pusher member <b>90</b> can also extend at an angle in a superior direction with respect to a longitudinal axis A of the advancer <b>40</b>. Such a configuration allows the clip-pusher member <b>90</b> to extend into the clip track <b>30</b> to engage a clip, while the remainder of the advancer <b>40</b> extends substantially parallel to the clip track <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a clip-pusher member <b>90</b>′ of an advancer <b>40</b>′. In this embodiment, the clip-pusher member <b>90</b>′ is slightly more narrow and it has a small recess <b>92</b>′ formed in the distal-most end thereof. In use, the advancer <b>40</b> can engage and advance only the distal-most clip disposed within the clip track <b>30</b> into the jaws <b>20</b>. This is due to the positioning of the feed bar <b>38</b>, which is slidably movable between a fixed proximal and distal positions, as previously discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A–6G</figref> illustrate the clip advancing assembly in use, and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A–6D</figref> illustrate movement of the feed bar <b>38</b> within the clip track <b>30</b> to advance the feeder shoe <b>34</b> and clip supply <b>36</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6E–6F</figref> illustrate movement of the advancer <b>40</b> to advance a distal-most clip into the jaws <b>20</b>.

The feeder shoe <b>34</b> is disposed within the clip track <b>30</b> and, assuming the device <b>10</b> has not yet been used, the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is in a proximal-most position such that the superior tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is engaged with the proximal-most or first opening <b>30</b><i>c</i><sub>1 </sub>formed in the clip track <b>30</b> to prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b>, and the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is positioned between the first detent <b>84</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second detent <b>84</b><sub>2 </sub>in the feed bar <b>38</b>, such that the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>is biased in a superior direction by the feed bar <b>38</b>. The detents <b>84</b> in the feed bar are labeled sequentially as <b>84</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>84</b><sub>2</sub>, etc., and the openings <b>30</b><i>c </i>in the clip track <b>30</b> are labeled sequentially as <b>30</b><i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, <b>30</b><i>c</i><sub>2</sub>, etc. As is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a series of clips <b>36</b>, labeled sequentially as <b>36</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>36</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>with <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>being the distal-most clip, are positioned within the clip track <b>30</b> distal of the feeder shoe <b>34</b>.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, when the protrusion <b>86</b> abuts the distal end of the elongate slot <b>88</b> in the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>, the feed bar <b>38</b> is prevented from further distal movement. In this position, the feeder shoe <b>34</b> has advanced a predetermined distance to advance the clip supply <b>36</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>36</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>within the clip track <b>30</b> by a predetermined distance. The superior tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>of the feeder shoe <b>34</b> has been advanced into the second opening <b>30</b><i>c</i><sub>2 </sub>in the clip track <b>30</b> to prevent proximal movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b>, and the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> is still engaged by the first detent <b>84</b><sub>1 </sub>in the feed bar <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Movement of the feed bar <b>38</b> from the initial, proximal-most position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, to the final, distal-most position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, will also advance the distal-most clip <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>into the jaws <b>20</b>. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, distal movement of the feed bar <b>38</b> will cause the clip-pusher member <b>90</b> of the advancer <b>40</b>, which is attached to the distal end of the feed bar <b>38</b>, to engage the distal-most clip <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>disposed within the clip track <b>30</b> and to advance the clip <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>into the jaws <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, the advancer <b>40</b> will engage and initiate advancement of the distal-most clip <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>prior to engaging and initiating advancement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b>. As a result the distal-most clip <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>will advance a distance that is greater than a distance traveled by the feeder shoe <b>34</b>. Such a configuration allows only the distal-most clip <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>to be advanced into the jaws <b>20</b> without accidentally advancing an additional clip into the jaws <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Once the clip <b>36</b><sub>x </sub>has been partially or fully formed, the trigger <b>16</b> can be released to release the formed clip <b>36</b><sub>x</sub>. Release of the trigger <b>16</b> will also retract the feed bar <b>38</b> in a proximal direction until the protrusion <b>86</b> returns to the initial proximal-most position within the elongate slot <b>88</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>. As the feed bar <b>38</b> is retracted proximally, the feeder shoe <b>34</b> will not move proximally since the superior tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>will engage the second opening <b>30</b><i>c</i><sub>2 </sub>in the clip track <b>30</b>. The inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>will not interfere with proximal movement of the feed bar <b>38</b>, and once the feed bar <b>38</b> is in the initial, proximal-most position, as shown, the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>will be positioned between the second detent <b>84</b><sub>2 </sub>and the third detent <b>843</b> in the feed bar <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The process can be repeated to advance another clip into the jaws <b>20</b>. With each actuation of the trigger <b>16</b>, the inferior tang <b>82</b><i>b </i>will be engaged by the next detent, i.e., detent <b>84</b><sub>2 </sub>formed in the feed bar <b>38</b>, the superior tang <b>82</b><i>a </i>on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> will be moved distally into the next opening, i.e., opening <b>30</b><i>c</i><sub>3 </sub>on the clip track <b>30</b>, and the distal-most clip will be advanced into the jaws <b>20</b> and released. Where the device <b>10</b> includes a predetermined amount of clips, e.g., seventeen clips, the trigger <b>16</b> can be actuated seventeen times. Once the last clip has been applied, the stop, e.g., the third tang <b>82</b><i>c, </i>on the feeder shoe <b>34</b> can engage the stop tang <b>118</b> on the clip track <b>30</b> to prevent further distal movement of the feeder shoe <b>34</b>.</p>

Other techniques can, however, be used to mate the jaws <b>20</b> to the jaw retaining shaft <b>28</b>. For example, a dovetail connection, a male-female connection, etc., can be used. Alternatively, the jaws <b>20</b> can be integrally formed with the retaining shaft <b>28</b>. The distal portion <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the jaws <b>20</b> can be adapted to receive a clip therebetween, and thus the distal portion <b>20</b><i>b </i>can include first and second opposed jaw members <b>96</b><i>a, </i><b>96</b><i>b </i>that are movable relative to one another.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As previously mentioned, the surgical clip applier <b>10</b> can also include a tissue stop <b>46</b> for facilitating positioning of the tissue at the surgical site within jaws <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows one exemplary embodiment of a tissue stop <b>46</b> having proximal end and distal ends <b>46</b><i>a, </i><b>46</b><i>b. </i>The proximal end <b>46</b><i>a </i>can be adapted to mate to a distal end of the clip track <b>30</b> for positioning the tissue stop <b>46</b> adjacent to the jaws <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates the trigger insert <b>48</b> in more detail. The shape of the trigger insert <b>48</b> can vary depending on the other components of the housing <b>12</b>, but in the illustrated embodiment the trigger insert <b>48</b> includes a central portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>that is adapted to pivotally mate to the housing <b>12</b>, and an elongate portion <b>48</b><i>b </i>that is adapted to extend into and mate to the trigger <b>16</b>. The central portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>can include a bore <b>106</b> extending therethrough for receiving a shaft for pivotally mating the trigger insert <b>48</b> to the housing <b>12</b>. The central portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>can also include a first recess <b>108</b> formed in a superior side edge for receiving a portion of the feed link <b>52</b>. The first recess <b>108</b> preferably has a size and shape that allows a portion of the feed link <b>52</b> to extend therein such that the feed link <b>52</b> will be forced to pivot when the trigger insert <b>48</b> pivots due to movement of the trigger <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the first recess <b>108</b> is substantially elongate and includes a substantially circular portion formed therein for seating a shaft formed on a proximal end of the feed link <b>52</b>, as will be discussed in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The trigger insert <b>48</b> can also include a second recess <b>110</b> formed in a back side edge for receiving a closure link roller <b>54</b> that is coupled to the push bar <b>44</b> for moving the cam <b>42</b> to close the jaws <b>20</b>, and ratchet teeth <b>112</b> formed on the bottom side edge thereof for mating with a pawl <b>60</b> for controlling movement of the trigger <b>16</b>, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The exemplary feed bar coupler <b>50</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, and it can be adapted to couple the proximal end of the feed bar <b>38</b> to the distal end of the feed link <b>52</b>. While a variety of techniques can be used to mate the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> to the proximal end <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b>, in an exemplary embodiment the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> is formed from two separate halves <b>50</b><i>a, </i><b>50</b><i>b </i>that mate together to maintain the proximal end <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b> therebetween. When mated, the two halves <b>50</b><i>a, </i><b>50</b><i>b </i>together define a central shaft <b>50</b><i>c </i>having substantially circular flanges <b>50</b><i>d, </i><b>50</b><i>e </i>formed on opposed ends thereof and defining a recess <b>50</b><i>f </i>therebetween for seating a distal portion of the feed link <b>52</b>. The central shaft <b>50</b><i>c </i>defines a lumen <b>50</b><i>g </i>therethrough for receiving the proximal end <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the feed bar <b>38</b> and for locking the feed bar <b>38</b> in a substantially fixed position relative to the feed bar coupler <b>50</b>.

The shaft <b>53</b> can be adapted to pivotally rotate within the first recess <b>108</b> of the trigger insert <b>48</b>, thereby allowing the trigger insert <b>48</b> to pivot the feed link <b>52</b>. The distal end <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the feed link <b>52</b> can be adapted to couple to feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and thus, in an exemplary embodiment, it includes opposed arms <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b </i>formed thereon and defining an opening <b>116</b> therebetween for seating the central shaft <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the feed bar coupler <b>50</b>. The arms <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b </i>are effective to engage and move the coupler <b>50</b> as the feed link <b>52</b> pivots about a pivot axis X. The pivot axis X can be defined by the location at which the feed link <b>52</b> couples to the housing <b>12</b>, and it can be positioned anywhere on the feed link <b>52</b>, but in the illustrated embodiment it is positioned adjacent to the proximal end <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the feed link <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In an exemplary embodiment, the feed link <b>52</b> can be flexible to eliminate the need to calibrate the clip advancing assembly and the clip forming assembly. In particular, the feed link <b>52</b> allows the trigger <b>16</b> to continue moving toward a closed position even after the feed bar <b>38</b> and feed bar coupler <b>50</b> are in a distal-most position, and it provides some freedom to the clip forming and clip advancing assemblies. In other words, the trigger <b>16</b> is pliant relative to the feed bar <b>38</b> during closure of the trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The particular stiffness and strength of the feed link <b>52</b> can vary depending on the configuration of the clip advancing assembly and the clip forming assembly, but in one exemplary embodiment the feed link <b>52</b> has a stiffness that is in the range of 75 to 110 lbs per inch, and more preferably that is about 93 lbs per inch (as measured at the interface between the link <b>52</b> and the feed bar coupler <b>50</b>), and it has a strength of that is in the range of 25 lbs and 50 lbs, and more preferably that is about 35 lbs. The feed link <b>52</b> can also be formed from a variety of materials, including a variety of polymers, metals, etc. One exemplary material is a glass-reinforced polyetherimide, but a number of reinforced thermoplastics could be used, including glass reinforced liquid-crystal polymers, glass-reinforced nylons, and carbon-fiber reinforced versions of these and similar thermoplastics. Fiber-reinforced thermoset polymers such as thermoset polyesters could also be used. Feed link <b>52</b> could also be fabricated from a metal, such as spring steel to achieve the desired combination of limited flexibility and controlled strength.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A–17D</figref> illustrate the exemplary clip advancing assembly in use. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows an initial position, wherein the trigger <b>16</b> is resting in an open position, the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and feed bar <b>38</b> are in a proximal-most position, and the feed link <b>52</b> extends between the trigger insert <b>48</b> and the feed bar coupler <b>50</b>. As previously discussed, in the initial open position the protrusion <b>86</b> on the feed bar <b>38</b> in positioned in the proximal end of the elongate slot <b>88</b> in the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>. A first biasing member, e.g., spring <b>120</b>, is coupled to the trigger insert <b>48</b> and the housing <b>12</b> to maintain the trigger insert <b>48</b> and trigger <b>16</b> in the open position, and a second biasing member, e.g., spring <b>122</b>, extends between a shaft coupler <b>124</b>, which rotatably mates the shaft <b>18</b> to the housing <b>12</b>, and the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> to maintain the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and feed bar <b>38</b> in the proximal-most position.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">When the trigger <b>16</b> is actuated and moved toward the closed position, i.e., toward the stationary handle <b>14</b>, to overcome the biasing forces applied by the springs <b>120</b>,<b>122</b>, the trigger insert <b>48</b> begins to pivot in a counter-clockwise direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. As a result, the feed link <b>52</b> is forced to pivot in a counter-clockwise direction, thereby moving the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and feed bar <b>38</b> in a distal direction. The protrusion <b>86</b> on the feed bar <b>38</b> thus moves distally within the elongate slot <b>88</b> in the jaw retainer shaft <b>28</b>, thereby advancing the feeder shoe <b>34</b> and the clips <b>36</b> disposed within the clip track. Spring <b>120</b> is extended between the housing and the trigger insert <b>48</b>, and spring <b>122</b> is compressed between the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and the shaft coupler <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As the trigger <b>16</b> is further actuated and the trigger insert <b>48</b> continues to pivot, the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and feed bar <b>38</b> will eventually reach a distal-most position.

Spring <b>122</b> will be fully compressed between the shaft coupler <b>124</b> and the feed bar coupler <b>50</b>, and the feed link <b>52</b> will flex, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 17D</figref>. As the feed link <b>52</b> flexes, and more preferably once the feed link <b>52</b> fully flexed, the clip forming assembly will be actuated to close the jaws <b>20</b>. The feed link <b>52</b> will remain flexed during actuation of the clip forming assembly, e.g., the second stage of actuation, such that the trigger insert <b>48</b> is pliant relative to the clip advancing assembly, and in particular the feed bar <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">An exemplary clip forming assembly of the housing <b>12</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18–20</figref>.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">An exemplary embodiment of a closure link <b>56</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, and as shown it has opposed arms <b>126</b><i>a, </i><b>126</b><i>b </i>that are spaced a distance apart from one another.

A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other techniques can be used to mate the closure link <b>56</b> to the closure link roller <b>54</b> and the closure coupler <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">An exemplary closure coupler <b>58</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, and as shown it includes a proximal portion <b>58</b><i>a </i>having two arms <b>136</b><i>a, </i><b>136</b><i>b </i>with lumens <b>138</b><i>a, </i><b>138</b><i>b </i>extending therethrough and adapted to be aligned with the lumen <b>134</b> in the closure link <b>56</b> for receiving a shaft to mate the two components.

The distal portion <b>58</b><i>b </i>of the closure coupler <b>58</b> can also be configured to receive a portion of the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> when the trigger <b>16</b> is in the open position.

<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In other exemplary embodiments, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20B and 20C</figref>, a biasing member can be disposed within the cut-out <b>59</b> to bias the push rod <b>44</b> in a distal direction. Such a configuration will prevent accidental release of a clip from the jaws, particularly during the early stages of closure, if the user eases-up on the trigger <b>16</b>. In particular, while the anti-backup mechanism, discussed in more detail below, can be adapted to prevent the trigger <b>16</b> from opening until the trigger <b>16</b> reaches a predetermined position, the anti-backup mechanism may allow some minor movement of the trigger <b>16</b>. Thus, in the event a user eases-up on the trigger <b>16</b> and minor opening of the trigger <b>16</b> occurs, the biasing member will bias the push rod <b>44</b> in a distal direction, thereby maintaining the push rod <b>44</b> in a substantially fixed position. While a variety of biasing members can be used, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, the biasing member is a cantilevered beam <b>61</b> that is positioned between the proximal end <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the push rod <b>44</b> and the back wall of the recess <b>59</b> to bias the push rod <b>44</b> distally.

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In use, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A–17D</figref>, as the trigger <b>16</b> is initially moved from the open position toward the closed position, the closure link roller <b>54</b> will roll within the recess <b>110</b> in the trigger insert <b>48</b>. Once the feed bar <b>38</b> and feed bar coupler <b>50</b> are in the distal-most position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, further actuation of the trigger <b>16</b> will cause the recess <b>110</b> in the trigger insert <b>48</b> to engage the closure link roller <b>54</b> forcing it to pivot with the trigger insert <b>48</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>. As a result, the closure coupler <b>58</b> will move distally, thereby causing the push rod <b>44</b> to move distally. As the push rod <b>44</b> advances distally, the cam <b>42</b> is advanced over the jaws <b>20</b> to close the jaws <b>20</b> and crimp the clip positioned therebetween. The trigger <b>16</b> can optionally be partially closed to only partially close the jaws <b>20</b> and thus partially crimp a clip disposed therebetween. Exemplary techniques for facilitating selective full and partial closure of the clip will be discussed in more detail below. Once the clip is applied, the trigger <b>16</b> can be released thereby allowing spring <b>120</b> to pull the trigger insert <b>48</b> back to its initial position, and allowing spring <b>122</b> to force the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and feed bar <b>38</b> back to the proximal position. As the trigger insert <b>48</b> returns to its initial position, the closure link roller <b>54</b> is moved back to its initial position as well, thereby pulling the closure link <b>56</b>, closure coupler <b>58</b>, and push bar <b>44</b> proximally.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The surgical clip applier <b>10</b> can also include a variety of other features to facilitate use of the device <b>10</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the surgical clip applier <b>10</b> can include an anti-backup mechanism for controlling movement of the trigger <b>16</b>. In particular, the anti-backup mechanism can prevent the trigger <b>16</b> from opening during a partial closing stroke. However, once the trigger reaches a predetermined position, at which point the clip positioned between the jaws can be partially crimped, the anti-backup mechanism can release the trigger allowing the trigger to open and release the clip or to close to fully crimp the clip, as may be desired by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> illustrate one exemplary embodiment of an anti-backup mechanism in the form of a ratchet. As shown, the ratchet includes a set of teeth <b>112</b> formed on the trigger insert <b>48</b>, and a pawl <b>60</b> that is adapted to be rotatably disposed within the housing <b>12</b> and positioned adjacent to the trigger insert <b>48</b> such that closure of the trigger <b>16</b> and pivotal movement of the trigger insert <b>48</b> will cause the pawl <b>60</b> to engage the teeth <b>112</b>. The teeth <b>112</b> can be configured to prevent rotation of the pawl <b>60</b> until the pawl <b>60</b> reaches a predetermined position, at which point the pawl <b>60</b> is free to rotate, thereby allowing the trigger <b>16</b> to open or close. The predetermined position preferably corresponds to a position at which the jaws <b>20</b> are partially closed. In an exemplary embodiment, as shown, the teeth <b>112</b> include a first set of teeth <b>112</b><i>a, </i>e.g., ten teeth, having a size that prevents rotation of the pawl <b>60</b> relative thereto, thus preventing the trigger <b>16</b> from opening when the pawl <b>60</b> is engaged with the first set <b>112</b><i>a </i>of teeth <b>112</b>. The teeth <b>112</b> can also include a final or terminal tooth, referred to as a tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b, </i>that has a size that allows the pawl <b>60</b> to rotate relative thereto when the pawl <b>60</b> is engaged with the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b. </i>In particular, the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b </i>preferably has a size that is substantially greater than the size of the first set of teeth <b>112</b><i>a </i>such that a relatively large notch <b>140</b> is formed between the first set of teeth <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b. </i>The notch <b>140</b> has a size that allows the pawl <b>60</b> to pivot therein, thus allowing the pawl <b>60</b> to be selectively moved beyond the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b </i>or back toward the first set of teeth <b>112</b><i>a. </i>A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b </i>can have the same size or a smaller size than the first ten teeth <b>112</b><i>a </i>while still providing a notch <b>140</b> formed therebetween that allows the pawl <b>60</b> to pivot therein.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A–22D</figref> illustrates the ratchet mechanism in use. When the trigger <b>16</b> is initially moved toward a closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, the pawl <b>60</b> will engage the first set of teeth <b>112</b><i>a </i>thereby preventing the trigger <b>16</b> from opening. Further actuation of the trigger <b>16</b> will cause the pawl <b>60</b> to advance past the first set of teeth <b>112</b><i>a </i>until the pawl <b>60</b> reaches the notch <b>140</b> next to the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b. </i>Once the pawl <b>60</b> reaches the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b, </i>at which point the jaws <b>20</b> are partially closed due the partial distal movement of the cam <b>42</b> over the jaws <b>20</b>, the pawl <b>60</b> is free to rotate thereby allowing the trigger <b>16</b> to open or close, as may be desired by the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> illustrates the trigger <b>16</b> in a fully-closed position, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22D and 22E</figref> illustrate the trigger <b>16</b> returning to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The ratchet mechanism can also be configured to emit an audible sound that indicates the position of the jaws <b>20</b>. For example, a first sound can be emitted when the pawl <b>60</b> engages the first set of teeth <b>112</b><i>a, </i>and a second, different sound, e.g., a louder sound, can be emitted when the pawl <b>60</b> engages the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b. </i>As a result, when the trigger <b>16</b> reaches the predetermined position at which the pawl <b>60</b> is engaged with the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b, </i>the sound indicates to the user that the jaws <b>20</b> are in the partially closed position. The user can thus release the trigger <b>16</b> to release a partially closed clip, or they can fully close the trigger <b>16</b> to fully close the clip.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In another exemplary embodiment, the surgical clip applier <b>10</b> can include an overload mechanism that is adapted to prevent overload of a force applied to the jaws <b>20</b> by the trigger <b>16</b>. Typically, during application of a surgical clip, a certain force is required to close the jaws <b>20</b> and crimp the clip around the tissue positioned therebetween. As the forming process proceeds and the clip is at least partially closed, the force required to continue closing the jaws <b>20</b> around the clip significantly increases. Accordingly, in an exemplary embodiment, the overload mechanism can have a resistance that correlates to the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b>. In other words, the resistance of the overload mechanism can increase as the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b> increases. The resistance is, however, preferably slightly greater than the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b> to prevent accidental actuation of the overload mechanism. As a result, if the jaws <b>20</b> are prevented from closing when the trigger <b>16</b> is initially actuated, the force required to overcome the resistance of the overload mechanism is relatively low. This is particularly advantageous as the jaws <b>20</b> are more susceptible to being deformed when they are open or only partially closed. The overload mechanism will actuate more readily in the early stages of clip formation to prevent deformation of the jaws. Conversely, when the jaws <b>20</b> are substantially closed, the resistance is relatively high such that the overload mechanism can only be actuated upon application of a significant force applied to the jaws <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref> illustrates one exemplary embodiment of an overload mechanism <b>62</b>, showing an exploded view. In general, the overload mechanism can include an overload housing <b>64</b> formed from two halves <b>64</b><i>a, </i><b>64</b><i>b </i>and containing a profile link <b>66</b>, a toggle link <b>68</b>, a pivot link <b>70</b>, and a biasing assembly <b>72</b>. The biasing assembly <b>72</b> can include a spring post <b>150</b> that is coupled to the housing <b>64</b> and that includes a bore extending therethrough for receiving a plunger <b>154</b>. A spring <b>152</b> is disposed around the spring post <b>150</b>, and the plunger <b>154</b> extends through the spring post <b>150</b> and includes a head <b>154</b><i>a </i>formed thereon that is adapted to abut against the spring <b>152</b>. The pivot link <b>70</b> can be generally L-shaped and it can be coupled to the housing <b>64</b> by a pivot pin <b>156</b> extending therethrough. A proximal end <b>70</b><i>a </i>of the pivot link <b>70</b> can contact the head <b>154</b><i>a </i>of the plunger <b>154</b>, and a distal end <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the pivot link <b>70</b> can be pivotally coupled to the toggle link <b>68</b> by a pivot pin <b>166</b>. The toggle link <b>68</b>, in turn, can be coupled to the profile link <b>66</b>, which can be slidably and pivotally positioned within the housing <b>64</b> adjacent to an opening <b>64</b>d formed in the housing. Pivotal movement of the profile link <b>66</b> within the housing <b>64</b> can be achieved by, for example, a pivot pin <b>158</b> that extends through the profile link <b>66</b> and is that disposed within a first slot <b>160</b><i>a </i>(only one slot is shown) formed in each half <b>64</b><i>a, </i><b>64</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>64</b>, and slidable movement of the profile link <b>66</b> within the housing <b>64</b> can be achieved by, for example, opposed protrusions <b>168</b><i>a, </i><b>168</b><i>b </i>formed on the profile link <b>66</b> that are received within a second slot <b>160</b><i>b </i>(only one slot is shown) formed in each half <b>64</b><i>a, </i><b>64</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In use, the profile link <b>66</b> can be adapted to receive a force from the clip forming assembly and to counter the force with the resistance of the biasing assembly <b>72</b>. In particular, the overload mechanism <b>62</b> uses the spring <b>152</b> along with the toggle link <b>68</b> and pivot link <b>70</b> to bias the profile link <b>66</b> from either rotating about the pivot pin <b>158</b> or sliding against the housing <b>64</b>. For the rotational aspect, the force exerted by the compressed spring <b>152</b> is transferred through the toggle link <b>68</b> and pivot link <b>70</b>, such that a rotational moment is applied to the profile link <b>66</b> against the housing <b>64</b>. Thus this assembly causes the profile link <b>66</b> to resist rotation with respect to the housing <b>64</b>. If the moment generated by a radial load from the closure link roller <b>54</b> against the profile link <b>66</b> exceeds the moment of the pivot link <b>70</b> and toggle link <b>68</b>, the profile link <b>66</b> begins to rotate, buckling the toggle link <b>68</b> and causing the pivot link <b>70</b> to further compress the spring <b>152</b>. For the sliding aspect, the pivot link <b>70</b>, toggle link <b>68</b>, and profile link <b>66</b> are aligned such that the sliding force (resistance to slide) is the force required to buckle the toggle link <b>68</b> and pivot link <b>70</b>. If the radial load from the closure link roller <b>54</b> against the profile link <b>66</b> exceeds the buckling force of the linkages, then the pivot link <b>70</b> further compresses the spring <b>152</b> as the profile link <b>66</b> slides proximally.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">This is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23B–23C</figref>, and as shown the opening <b>64</b><i>d </i>in the housing <b>64</b> allows the closure link roller <b>54</b> of the clip forming assembly to roll against the profile link <b>66</b>. As a result, when the trigger <b>16</b> is actuated and moved toward the closed position, the closure link roller <b>54</b> applies a force to the profile link <b>66</b>. The resistance of the overload spring <b>152</b> will, however, maintain the profile link <b>66</b> in a substantially fixed position unless the force applied by the closure link roller <b>54</b> increases to a force that is greater than the resistance, e.g., a threshold force. This can be caused by, for example, a foreign object positioned between the jaws <b>20</b> or when the jaws <b>20</b> are fully closed with the clip and vessel, duct, shunt, etc. therebetween. When the jaws <b>20</b> cannot be further closed, the force applied to the closure link roller <b>54</b> from the closing motion of the trigger <b>16</b> will be transferred to the profile link <b>66</b>, which will then pivot and slide within the housing <b>64</b>, thereby causing the pivot link <b>70</b> to pivot, which forces the plunger <b>154</b> to compress the overload spring <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As previously noted, the force required to actuate the overload mechanism can correlate to the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b>, which increases as the trigger <b>16</b> is moved to the closed position. This can be achieved due to the configuration of the profile link <b>66</b>. In particular, when the closure link roller <b>54</b> first comes into contact with the profile link <b>66</b> and is thus in a lower position, the profile link <b>66</b> can pivot within the housing <b>64</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>. As the closure link roller <b>54</b> moves upward along the profile link <b>66</b>, the force required to overcome the resistance of the overload mechanism increases because the profile link <b>66</b> must slide within the housing <b>64</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>. The force required to pivot the profile link <b>66</b> can be less than the force required to slide the profile link <b>66</b>. Accordingly, if the jaws <b>20</b> are prevented from being closed, e.g., by a foreign object, as the trigger is initially actuated, a minimal force will be required to cause the closure link roller <b>54</b> to transfer the force to the lower portion of the profile link <b>66</b> causing the profile link <b>66</b> to pivot. When the jaws <b>20</b> are substantially closed and the trigger <b>16</b> is almost fully actuated, a significant amount of force is required to cause the closure link roller <b>54</b> to transfer the force to the upper portion of the profile link <b>66</b> causing the profile link <b>66</b> to slide within the housing <b>64</b> to overcome the resistance of the overload spring <b>152</b>. While the amount of force required to actuate the overload mechanism can be greater than and can increase relative to the amount of force required to close the jaws <b>20</b>, the force is preferably only slightly greater than the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b> to prevent deformation or other damage to the jaws <b>20</b>. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the resistance can be adjusted based on the force necessary to close the jaws <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The profile link <b>66</b>, and in particular the distal-facing surface <b>66</b><i>s </i>of the profile link <b>66</b>, can also have a shape that facilitates correlation between the force required to actuate the overload mechanism and the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b>. For example, where the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b> increases at a linear rate, the distal-facing surface <b>66</b><i>s </i>of the profile link <b>66</b> can be planar to prevent the profile link <b>66</b> from interfering with movement of the closure link roller <b>54</b> there over, and to allow a linear force to be applied to the trigger <b>16</b> to close the jaws <b>20</b>. Conversely, where the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b> is non-linear as the trigger <b>16</b> is moved to the closed position, the profile link <b>66</b> can have a non-linear shape that corresponds to the non-linear force. Such a configuration will prevent the forces required to close the cam <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) from becoming too high.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">By way of non-limiting example, the force required to close the jaws <b>20</b> can be non-linear due to the shape of the recess <b>104</b> in the cam <b>42</b> that is adapted to push the jaw members <b>96</b><i>a, </i><b>96</b><i>b </i>toward one another. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the recess <b>104</b> can have a curved configuration such that the force will vary as the cam <b>42</b> passes over the jaw members <b>96</b><i>a, </i><b>96</b><i>b. </i>The profile link <b>66</b> can therefore having a corresponding curved distal-facing surface such that the force will also vary as the closure link roller <b>54</b> passes there over. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>, the profile link <b>66</b> is curved such that the lower portion of the profile link <b>66</b> is substantially convex and the upper portion of the profile link <b>66</b> is substantially concave. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the profile link <b>66</b> can have a variety of other shapes, and that a variety of other techniques can be used to optimize the force necessary to close the jaws <b>20</b> and the force necessary to actuate the overload mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A person skilled in the art will also appreciate that the overload mechanism can have a variety of other configurations. By way of non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23D</figref> illustrates an overload mechanism that is in the form of a cantilevered beam <b>170</b> for receiving a force applied by the closure link roller <b>54</b>. The beam <b>170</b> can have a substantially curved member <b>172</b> with a bracket <b>174</b> coupled to one end thereof. The curved member <b>172</b> can have a bending moment that, when loaded with a force greater then the bending moment, buckles to assume a low rigidity condition. The bracket <b>174</b> can provide more rigidity to the curved member <b>172</b> such that the bending moment increases adjacent to the bracket <b>174</b>. In use, the beam <b>170</b> can be loaded within the housing <b>12</b> of the clip applier <b>10</b> such that the closure link roller <b>54</b> contacts the concave surface, and the beam <b>170</b> can be positioned at an angle such that the closure link roller <b>54</b> is farther away from the beam when the trigger <b>16</b> is initially actuated, and the closure link roller <b>54</b> becomes closer to the beam as the trigger <b>16</b> moves to the closed position. As a result, the resistance to buckling will increase as the closure link roller <b>54</b> moves thereof and the trigger <b>16</b> of the clip applier is moved to the closed position. Although not shown, multiple beams could optionally be used in a stacked fashion and the terminal or free end of the beam(s) could be contoured to tailor the buckling load at a particular point along the length of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In another exemplary embodiment, the surgical clip applier <b>10</b> can include a clip quantity indicator for indicating the number of clips remaining in the device <b>10</b>. While various techniques can be used to indicate the quantity of clips remaining, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A–25</figref> illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a clip quantity indicator having an indicator wheel <b>74</b> and an indicator actuator <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The indicator wheel <b>74</b> is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>, and as shown it has a generally circular or cylindrical shape that defines a central axis Y about which the wheel <b>74</b> is adapted to rotate. The wheel <b>74</b> includes teeth <b>142</b> formed therearound and adapted to be engaged by the indicator actuator <b>76</b>, and an indicator member <b>144</b>. The indicator member <b>144</b> can have a variety of configurations, but in an exemplary embodiment the indicator member <b>144</b> is in the form of a contrasting color pad having a color, e.g., orange, red, etc., that differs from the remainder of the indicator wheel <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the exemplary indicator actuator <b>76</b> in more detail.

Accordingly, the indicator actuator <b>76</b> can include a protrusion <b>146</b>, only a portion of which is shown, formed on an inferior surface thereof for extending into the recess <b>50</b><i>f </i>formed between the circular flanges <b>50</b><i>d, </i><b>50</b><i>e </i>on the feed bar coupler <b>50</b>. The protrusion <b>146</b> allows the indicator actuator <b>76</b> to be engaged by the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> and moved therewith. The indicator actuator <b>76</b> can also include an engagement mechanism <b>148</b> formed thereon and adapted to engage the teeth <b>142</b> formed on the indicator wheel <b>74</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the engagement mechanism <b>148</b> on the indicator actuator <b>76</b> is in the form of an arm having a tab formed on the end thereof for engaging the teeth <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In use, the indicator wheel <b>74</b> is rotatably disposed within the housing <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A–26B</figref>, and the indicator actuator <b>76</b> is slidably disposed within the housing <b>12</b> such that the engagement mechanism <b>148</b> is positioned adjacent to the indicator wheel <b>74</b> and the protrusion <b>146</b> extends into the feed bar coupler <b>50</b>. The housing <b>12</b> includes a window <b>12</b><i>a </i>formed therein for providing visual access to the indicator wheel <b>144</b>. As the trigger <b>16</b> is moved to the closed position and the feed bar coupler <b>50</b> is moved distally, the indicator actuator <b>76</b> will move distally with the feed bar <b>38</b> and feed bar coupler <b>50</b>. As a result, the engagement mechanism <b>148</b> on the indicator actuator <b>76</b> will engage the teeth <b>142</b> on the indicator wheel <b>74</b>, thereby causing the wheel <b>74</b> to rotate as a clip is advanced into the jaws <b>20</b>. Each time the trigger <b>16</b> is actuated to advance a clip <b>20</b> into the jaws <b>20</b>, the indicator actuator <b>74</b> rotates the indicator wheel <b>76</b>. When the clip supply has two or three clips left, the contrasting color pad <b>144</b> on the indicator wheel <b>74</b> will begin to appear in the window <b>12</b><i>a </i>formed in the housing <b>12</b>, thereby indicating to the user that only a few clips remain. The contrasting color pad <b>144</b> can be adapted to occupy the entire window <b>12</b><i>a </i>when the clip supply is depleted.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In another exemplary embodiment, the indicator wheel <b>74</b> can include an anti-backup mechanism that is adapted to prevent the indicator wheel <b>74</b> from rotating in a reverse direction, e.g., a counter-clockwise direction, after being advanced. While the anti-backup mechanism can have a variety of configurations, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> the indicator wheel <b>74</b> includes opposed arms <b>73</b><i>a, </i><b>73</b><i>b </i>that extend substantially parallel to the axis Y. Each arm <b>73</b><i>a, </i><b>73</b><i>b </i>has a pawl <b>75</b><i>a, </i><b>75</b><i>b </i>formed on a distal-most end thereof that is adapted to engage corresponding teeth formed on the housing <b>12</b>. While not shown, the corresponding teeth can be formed within a circular protrusion formed on an inner portion of the housing <b>12</b> adjacent to the window <b>12</b><i>a. </i>When the indicator wheel <b>74</b> is disposed within the housing <b>12</b>, the arms <b>73</b><i>a, </i><b>73</b><i>b </i>extend into the circular protrusion formed around the inner circumference thereof. As a clip is applied and the indicator wheel <b>74</b> is rotated, the arms <b>73</b><i>a, </i><b>73</b><i>b </i>can deflect over the teeth in the housing to move to the next position. When the indicator actuator <b>76</b> slides proximally to return to its initial position, the arms <b>73</b><i>a, </i><b>73</b><i>b </i>will engage the teeth in the housing to prevent the indicator wheel <b>74</b> from rotating in a reverse direction, i.e., returning to the previous position. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other techniques can be used to prevent backup of the indicator wheel <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As previously mentioned, the surgical clip applier <b>10</b> can be used to apply a partially or fully closed clip to a surgical site, such as a vessel, duct, shunt, etc. In laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery, a small incision is made in the patient's body to provide access to a surgical site. A cannula or access port is typically used to define a working channel extending from the skin incision to the surgical site. Often during surgical procedures it is necessary to cease blood flow through the vessels or other ducts, and some procedures may require the use of a shunt. A surgical clip can thus be used to crimp the vessel or to secure the shunt to the vessel. Accordingly, a surgical clip applier, such as clip applier <b>10</b>, can be introduced through the cannula or otherwise introduced into the surgical site to position the jaws <b>20</b> around the vessel, shunt, or other duct. The tissue stop <b>46</b> can facilitate positioning of the jaws <b>20</b> around the target site. The trigger <b>16</b> can then be actuated to cause a clip to be advanced between the jaws and positioned around the target site, and to cause the jaws <b>20</b> to close to crimp the clip. Depending on the intended use of the clip, the trigger <b>16</b> can be partially actuated, as indicated by the audible sound of the pawl <b>60</b> reaching the tock tooth <b>112</b><i>b, </i>or it can be fully actuated. The trigger <b>16</b> is then released to release the partially or fully closed clip, and the procedure can be repeated if necessary to apply additional clips.</p>
