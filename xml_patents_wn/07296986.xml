<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a nationalization of PCT/EP04/010626 filed 22 Sep. 2004 and published in German.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to equipment that lays flat films or tubular films.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Lay-flat equipment of this type is known. The equipment is used especially in extrusion devices, which extrude tubular films with the help of a blown film die. These tubular films are either laid flat completely or are sub-divided previously into films or tubular films and are laid flat subsequently. The lay-flat equipment usually consists of lay-flat plates and/or lay-flat frames placed against one another in a wedge-shaped manner, said plates and/or frames being loaded with surfaces, on which the film to be laid flat and/or the walls of the tubular film slide along. It has been suggested in recent times that rollers be used instead of these surfaces. This is illustrated, for example, in DE 101 40 577 A1 and EP 795 391 A2. The purpose of the use of the rollers is to prevent damages of the freshly extruded films caused by the lay-flat equipments. However, devising measures for further reducing these damages continues to be among the preoccupations of those of skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore the present invention is based on the aforementioned devices and its object is to further prevent the mentioned damages of the film. This object is achieved by the features of the invention described herein. In the words of the present application, torque can be provided both by a motor, thus an actively torque-generating unit as well as by a brake mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This concept is based on the fact that a brake mechanism provides “negative torque” while a motor provides “positive torque.” Positive torque supports the proper movement of the film, negative works against it. Either brakes or motors can be advantageous in case of different films. A design form of the torque transfer devices according to the invention is of great advantage in case of both types of torque transfer devices in the sense of the present invention. Both a brake as well as a motor can bring about damages on the film due to the rigid manner of torque provision that is peculiar to it. Therefore the present invention teaches to provide torque transfer devices, which allow a slip between the roller and the means for providing the torque. Here, a slip is present at least, when the roller rotates at a different speed per unit of time than the driving journals of the means for providing the torque. The torque transfer devices are often advantageously embodied as a coupling. Force-fit connections in the sense of the usual definitions and the present invention are connections, in which the parts which to be connected are held by a force, e.g., a frictional force, in their opposite position. In the case of an exceedance of a certain force and/or in this case a certain torque, a movement of the two connected parts towards each other becomes possible (often the parts to be connected slide toward one another), without irreproducibly destroying the connection in doing so. An example of a force-fit power transmission is friction gears and also friction couplings. Friction usually plays a role even in hydraulic couplings, as a result of which they are usually categorized under the term “frictional force-fit connections.” Bringing about or supporting a force-fit connection using a magnet is among the measures, which can be consulted for an advantageous embodiment of the present invention. Here it is immaterial whether the total force for implementing the force-fit connection is provided by the magnet, or whether the magnet presses together, for example, two disks, which on their part, bring about the force-fit connection by their friction. In all types of a force-fit connection, it appears to be advantageous if the force flow surfaces turned towards one another and using which the force-fit connection takes place and using which the torque is finally transferred, are reducible or increasable. Due to this, the amount of the maximum torque transmission can be defined and/or varied. Usually force flow surfaces are the surfaces of plate-shaped coupling pieces, said surfaces being turned towards one another, wherein said coupling pieces pressed together using any force thus create the force fit or friction fit. If several such transfer devices are provided, it appears advantageous to interconnect this multitude of force flow devices so that a relative movement of the force flow surfaces assigned to the torque providing means opposite to the force flow surfaces assigned to the rollers leads to a change in the maximum transferable torque in all transfer devices. Another alternative to change the maximum transferable torque of such a force-fit connection provides a torque transfer device, which implements the force-fit connection with the help of an electromagnet. In case of such an electromagnet, the field intensity can be changed by a variation of the current intensity, with which the electromagnet is controlled. Due to this naturally even the strength of the force-fit connection is changeable. The changeability can play an important role for the film quality especially during order changes or when determining damages, for example using sensors observing the film and is thus markedly advantageous when embodying the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a lay-flat equipment <b>1</b>, which consists of two lay-flat devices <b>7</b> placed against one another in a wedge-shaped manner and having rollers <b>13</b>. The lay-flat equipment <b>1</b> is a part of a blown film extrusion installation <b>2</b> for the production of tubular films <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The flow of material in the blown film extrusion installation starts at the supply funnel <b>4</b> of the extruder <b>3</b> using which plastic raw material-preferably in granulate form—is supplied to the extruder <b>3</b>. As is generally known, the extruder <b>3</b> transforms the raw material (not illustrated) into a semi fluid form, which is supplied to the blown film die <b>5</b> by way of the connecting piece <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The blown film die <b>5</b> extrudes the tubular film <b>6</b>, which is laid-flat in the lay-flat equipment <b>1</b>, which consists of two lay-flat devices <b>7</b>, placed against one another in a wedge-shaped manner. The squeegee rollers <b>8</b> additionally squeeze the laid-flat film <b>9</b>. The laid-flat film moves over rollers <b>10</b> to the winding device <b>11</b> and is wound up there on the roll <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Blown film extrusion installations of this have been known for a long time and therefore exist in all possible embodiments. Thus it is customary to first supply the laid-flat film <b>9</b> after the squeezing process to a so-called oscillating unit in order to improve the winding quality. Such an oscillating unit is not shown in the embodiment illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the lay-flat equipment <b>1</b> having two lay-flat devices <b>7</b>, also called lay-flat plates <b>7</b> that are arranged in a wedge-shaped manner relative to one another. The tubular film <b>6</b> moves in the feed direction of the film, which is indicated by the arrow <b>19</b>, though the lay-flat equipment <b>1</b> and in doing so slides along the rollers <b>13</b>. A brake mechanism <b>15</b> is assigned to each of the braking rollers <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates two sensors <b>18</b>, which are held above and below the laid-flat film <b>9</b>. These sensors examine the film for damages and folds. They are preferably optical sensors. Such sensors can also be arranged between the rollers <b>16</b> or roller groups <b>17</b>. Such arrangements facilitate the assignment of the damages or folds to the rollers causing them.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a lay-flat equipment <b>1</b> having unbraked rollers <b>13</b> and braked rollers <b>16</b>, wherein in this embodiment the braked rollers of a lay-flat device <b>7</b> are each braked by a brake mechanism <b>15</b>. Here the braking force and/or the torque is transferred using belts (not illustrated). The rollers braked by a brake mechanism belong to a group of rollers <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In all three figures, the control and regulating devices, control lines, electricity cables and the like were not shown for illustrational reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a sketch of an arrangement of a roller <b>16</b> according to the invention and a torque providing means <b>24</b> of a lay-flat equipment <b>1</b>. The roller <b>16</b> is provided with a driving journal <b>22</b> and the torque providing means <b>24</b> are equipped with a driving journal <b>23</b>. Drive disks <b>21</b> and <b>20</b> are attached on the driving journals <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>. The peripheral surfaces of both these drive disks <b>21</b> and <b>20</b> contact one another and in this way define a force-fit connection <b>27</b>. The peripheral surfaces of both the drive disks are smooth and advantageously processed from an elastic material such as rubber. This arrangement of roller and torque providing means <b>24</b> is especially suitable for implementing the arrangements of rollers <b>16</b> and torque providing means <b>24</b>, as illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. An illustration of the additional elements of the lay-flat equipment, as for example, illustrated in the first three figures and as required, for example, in order to hold and/or support the rollers <b>16</b> and the torque providing means <b>24</b>, is omitted here as in case of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a sketch of another function pair made of a roller <b>16</b> and a torque providing means <b>24</b>. Here also, the driving journals <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> can be seen. These driving journals are connected to a coupling <b>38</b>, which is simply illustrated as a rectangle almost in the form of a blackbox. This coupling can be a customary frictional coupling or it can represent a gear coupling, or even a hydraulic coupling. As specified in the claims, the characteristic of the coupling <b>38</b> or of a coupling generally in the sense of the present application is the separability of the torque providing means <b>24</b> and the roller <b>16</b>. It follows from this description that even an equipment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or according to the subsequent figures can be implemented as a coupling, if the corresponding drive disks <b>21</b> and <b>20</b> or force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> in the subsequent figures can be separated. What naturally stands out when comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> is that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the roller <b>16</b> and the torque providing means <b>24</b> follow one another in the radial direction r of the roller <b>16</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> these two elements <b>16</b> and <b>24</b> are arranged in such a way that they follow one another in the axial direction of the roller <b>16</b>. The higher installation length in the aforementioned axial direction z of the roller <b>16</b> is naturally among the disadvantages of this arrangement. The advantages, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref>, are that it is usually simpler to provide drive disks or force flow disks, which comprise a large force flow surface having a large opposite overlapping surface.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the contact surface between both the drive disks <b>21</b> and <b>20</b> is rather small. As mentioned before, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also illustrates an arrangement of a roller <b>16</b> and a torque providing means <b>24</b>. The driving journals <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> of these two elements follow one another in the axial direction z of the roller <b>16</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. They are interconnected by both the force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, which comprise force flow surfaces that are turned towards one another and contact one another and in this way define the force-fit connection <b>27</b>. The force existing between these two force flow disks can be applied in that the two disks are pressed on top of one another by an external force and a friction arises in this way, which prevents a slipping of the disks against one another during the circular motion till a maximum torque transmission is exceeded. However, it is also possible to provide the forces using suitable measures inside the two force flow disks <b>26</b> and <b>25</b>. Thus it is possible, to equip one or both the disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> with magnets, so that a magnetic attraction results between opposite magnetic poles or between the magnet and the ferromagnetics or in any other manner.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In each of the mentioned cases and in each of the cases in which a force-fit connection takes place between force flow surfaces of the force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, it is possible to change the amount of the maximum torque transmission between both the disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> by carrying out a displacement of the two force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> in the radial direction of the roller <b>16</b> and/or of the disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, so that as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the contact surface and/or the surface of the opposite overlap of both the force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> is changed and/or reduced, as illustrated. In this connection it must be pointed out that it is not absolutely necessary for the two force flow disks to be in direct contact. Thus, especially in case of the use of magnets, even an additional disk can be affixed or even a gap can exist between both the force flow disks. Inspite of that, the magnetic attractive forces will ensure a certain torque transmission between the two disks. Similar alternatives exist in case of the use of hydraulic couplings and/or force-fit connections, which are created with the help of liquids or similar media between two disks. Such measures are also reproducible for a person of skill in the art against the background of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A similar measure for changing the transferred torque, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates several function pairs <b>33</b><i>a, </i><b>33</b><i>b </i>made of roller <b>16</b> and torque providing means <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>. It is illustrated using the connecting rod <b>29</b> that the two torque providing means <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>are interconnected, so that they can be displaced in common in the radial direction of the rollers <b>16</b><i>a, b </i>and <i>c</i>. In this common displacement both the contact surfaces are reduced. Another difference from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is that the force flow disk <b>25</b><i>b</i>of the function pair <b>33</b><i>b </i>also receives force transferred for the operation of the roller <b>16</b><i>c</i>. It passes over this torque using the chain <b>30</b> to the drive disk <b>25</b><i>c </i>of the roller <b>16</b><i>c</i>. Using the measures, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS.7 and 8</figref>, it is also possible to change and/or to reduce by different amounts or even at a different proportion the contact surfaces of different drive disk pairs <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>by a suitable geometric design of the relations of the different drive disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> with respect to one another, by a suitable arrangement of the same in a lay-flat equipment and by the determination of a suitable axis of motion for the common movement, in case of a common movement from first drive disks to second drive disks. In this manner, it is possible to variably change the maximum torque to be transferred, which is decisive for the start of a slipping movement. The advantages of such a measure are similar to those of providing a different torque for different rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates again an arrangement, which is very similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. However, the power controller <b>32</b>, which is connected using the connecting cable <b>31</b> to the force flow disk <b>26</b>, is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The illustration of the power controller <b>32</b> and the electricity cable <b>31</b> is also naturally a sketched illustration. Normally, the electricity cable would have had to be guided using the driving journal <b>23</b> to the force flow disk <b>26</b> in order to remain operative. However, it should be indicated using the two additionally illustrated characteristics <b>32</b> and <b>31</b> that an electromagnet <b>35</b> is also superbly suitable for changing the maximum torque that can be transferred using the force-fit connection <b>27</b>. As mentioned already, this change takes place primarily using a changing current intensity with which the coils of the electromagnet <b>35</b> are loaded. This change involves a change in the magnetic field. An embodiment of the present invention having an electromagnet <b>35</b> can, however, be combined randomly with other embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> once again illustrate larger picture details having the force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> and clarify the location of the flow surfaces <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an arrangement without magnets <b>34</b>. The interspace between the force flow surfaces <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> is overstated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In reality such an arrangement is usually based on the fact that the force flow surfaces <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> lie on one another and create the friction in this manner. The force required for this purpose can be transferred onto the disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, for example, using the two driving journals <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>. The torque transfer then takes place due to the friction between both the disks. As previously mentioned, it is also possible, in principle, to leave a gap between the force flow surfaces <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> and to arrange in this gap, for example, a hydraulic liquid, which conveys a frictional force to the force flow surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another alternative to transfer force over a longer distance is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Here magnets <b>34</b> are arranged in both the force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>. These magnets form function pairs, each of which consists of magnets of the two disks, which are arranged in these two disks in opposition to one another and in a way are arranged in an anti-polar manner relative to one another, which leads to an attraction. It is thus also possible to transfer force by means of a magnetic gap. However, usually when using such magnetic couplings even friction can play a role, that is, the magnets provide the force which presses both the force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> together and in this manner leads to the necessary friction between the force flow surfaces <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. It can also be easily understood based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> that a displacement of one of the two force flow disks <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> even by small amounts in the radial direction of the roller r leads to a considerable reduction of the force built-up between the magnets <b>34</b> of the two disks <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>. Thus the maximum torque transferable by the force flow disk <b>26</b> onto the force flow disk <b>25</b> is reduced and thus it is ensured that a slipping occurs even at a lesser torque.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The invention being thus described, it will be apparent that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be recognized by one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>
