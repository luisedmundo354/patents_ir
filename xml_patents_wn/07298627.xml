<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A portable power inverter/converter having a pass through device for simultaneously sourcing A.C. and multiple voltage D.C. power consuming devices through a single D.C. power source connection. Inverter and converter circuitry is provided to invert and convert D.C. voltage to an A.C. voltage source and a lower DC voltage. A.C. electrical outlets are provided to facilitate a connection to an external A.C. power-consuming device and a DC outlet to a lower volt DC power-consuming device. The pass through device provides an independent and simultaneous connection to an additional D.C. outlet that would otherwise be eliminated when occupied by the inverter thus allowing simultaneous connection and operation of both A.C. and multi source D.C power consuming devices through a single external D.C. power outlet of a single D.C. power source.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is a Continuation-In-Part application of U.S. Ser. No. 10/795,217 filed on Mar. 9, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,272,008 and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is related to a power inverting device and more particularly to a portable power inverting device having a pass through device for connection and operation of both A.C. and D.C. power consuming devices to a single outlet of a single power source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Portable power inverter devices are well known in the art. These devices often provide a source of A.C. electrical power to run A.C. devices when in an environment where only a D.C. voltage source is available such as in an automobile. Power inverters provide the ability to power A.C. consuming devices when only such D.C. power sources are available. Examples of such power inverters are disclosed in the following U.S. patents, each of which are herein incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,411,514; 5,742,478; and 5,170,336. However, while these and other prior art inverters are connected to the D.C. power source, that connection/D.C. source is no longer useable while the inverter is connected.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to a portable power inverter having a housing enclosing power inverting circuitry. An electrical connector connects the housing to an external D.C. voltage source. The circuit assembly supported within said housing is electrically coupled to the external D.C. power source. The circuit assembly includes inverter circuit equipped with electrical components for inverting the supplied D.C. voltage to an A.C. voltage source. A.C. electrical outlets are provided to facilitate a connection to an external A.C. power consuming device. A pass through device provides an independent and simultaneous connection to an additional D.C. outlet to allow connection of an external D.C. power consuming device. The pass through device allows connection of D.C. consuming devices that would otherwise be connected directly to the external D.C. power source while the inverter is so connected thus allowing connection and operation of both A.C. and D.C power consuming devices through a single external D.C. power outlet of a single D.C. power source.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. depicts a persective view of the power inverter according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> depict the six side views of the inverter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A housing <b>11</b> made of aluminum or other suitable hard material encloses much of the working components of the inverter <b>1</b> with a pair of end plates <b>3</b>,<b>13</b> form to enclose the housing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the end plate <b>3</b> has multiple outlets; two A.C. outlets <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a D.C. outlet <b>7</b> and a power switch <b>9</b>. The D.C. outlet represents a pass-through outlet to maintain an available D.C. power source and will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>depicts an exploded view of the inverter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> exposing the essential working components. It is first to be understood, that power inverters for converting a 12 volt power source to an available 110 volt A.C. source is old and well known in the art. Conventionally, these components are mounted on a printed circuit board such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>. The printed circuit board has the essential components to convert a 12-volt power source for running an A.C. current consuming device. Such off the shelf circuitry is readily available to one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus no further details regarding the component circuitry or details regarding power inverting in general need to be discussed in further detail. Any power inverting circuitry for inverting 12 volts to A.C. voltage to run an A.C. consuming device may be employed. It is also understood the inverter circuitry can be designed for various power ratings over a range of watts. For example, a small 100 watt power inverter may be desirable for extreme portability to power low power consuming A.C. devices such as a clock or radio. The wattage rating may be increased to exceed 1000 watts depending on the intended application for the inverter. Such arrangements are well known in the art and are readily available. The present invention is primarily directed to the arrangement of power inverter components employing a pass through device to maintain the availability of the 12-volt source which powers the inverter. Thus the remaining discussion will be directed to such an arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As previously mentioned, the present invention includes two A.C. outlets <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>mounted on the end plate <b>3</b>. The outlets <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>are intended to power two different A.C. consuming devices by inverting a 12 volt (or other low voltage D.C. source) to A.C. Such a D.C. voltage source is often found in automobiles. For such use, the present invention includes a male plug type cigarette electrical connector <b>17</b> for insertion into a female cigarette outlet commonly found in automobiles as well as other 12-volt power sources. Power leads (positive and ground) <b>19</b> extend from the male plug <b>17</b> through a rear end plate <b>21</b> to connect the D.C. voltage source to the printed circuit board <b>15</b>. The power leads may first pass through a fuse box <b>23</b> prior to connecting to printed circuit board <b>15</b> as is conventionally known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The power leads <b>19</b> include a positive lead <b>19</b><i>a </i>and ground lead <b>19</b><i>b </i>which are connected/soldered to corresponding points on the printed circuit board <b>15</b>. Preferably the leads <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>are connected via removable connectors <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>which extend through the printed circuit board and are soldered to corresponding positive lines <b>27</b>/<b>28</b> at two points <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b </i>and <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>to ensure a secure connection to the circuit board. Thus the leads <b>19</b> bring power from an external D.C. voltage source to the inverter circuitry. The A.C. outlets <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>are connected to corresponding points on the printed circuit board as is conventional in the art and generally depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>. As the connection and supply of A.C. current to A.C. outlets in an inverter is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art, no further elaboration is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As previously discussed, it is desirable to make available a D.C. receptacle outlet to maintain a D.C. power source otherwise occupied by male plug <b>17</b>. Thus the inverter of the present invention includes a pass through device to maintain the availability of a D.C. outlet while the inverter is connected to the external D.C. power source. The present invention includes a female cigarette plug type outlet <b>7</b> disposed on end plate <b>3</b> adjacent A.C. outlets <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The D.C. outlet <b>7</b> is comprised of a common female receptacle as commonly employed as cigarette lighters in vehicles. The female outlet <b>7</b> is correspondingly dimensioned to accommodate the male plug <b>17</b> connecter and thus mirrors the female socket of the external D.C. voltage source to which the male plug <b>17</b> is normally connected.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To power the D.C. female outlet <b>7</b>, a positive lead <b>39</b><i>a </i>is connected through the printed circuit board and connected to positive line <b>27</b> at point <b>27</b><i>c </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A &amp; 8B</figref>. Similarly ground line <b>39</b><i>b </i>extends from the female outlet <b>7</b> through the printed circuit board <b>15</b> and is connected to ground line <b>28</b> at point <b>28</b><i>c</i>. Thus the female outlet <b>7</b> draws current directly from external D.C. power source in parallel to the inverter circuitry. Such an arrangement facilitates simultaneous use of the A.C. outlets and the D.C. outlet to the extent the load is not excessive relative to the rating of the external D.C. voltage source to which the inverter is connected. Should the load exceed a predetermined value, the fuse <b>23</b> would open the circuit isolating the inverter circuitry and female D.C. outlet <b>7</b> from the power source.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus the present invention provides a compact portable arrangement for inverting a D.C. voltage source to power an A.C. consuming device and incorporate a pass through device to simultaneously maintain the availability of a D.C. power source. The inverter unit effectively provides outlets to run both A.C. power consuming devices as well as D.C. power consuming devices simultaneously without having to make or break any connection between the inverter and original external D.C. power source.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To further enhance the performance of the inverter circuitry, each end plate are provided with ventilation holes to allow air to pass through the housing <b>11</b> and cool the electrical components during use. A fan <b>51</b> may also be employed to positively force air through the housing and may be connected to the inverter assembly as is commonly known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-13</figref> represent an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The power invert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is nearly identical to the power inverter shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> including all of its functional features. The power inverter includes internal circuitry to convert DC <b>12</b> volt source to alternative current (AC) and provides two AC outlets <b>105</b><i>a </i><b>105</b><i>b </i>as well as a DC Power Source pass through device <b>107</b> just as in the previous embodiment. A fan <b>151</b> is also included disposed adjacent the bottom side of the device <b>111</b> as well as ventilation holes <b>131</b> to facilitate circulation of cooling air to enhance heat dissipation from the device. The unit <b>111</b> includes a compact portable hand holdable housing <b>111</b> and includes a cigarette lighter style male connector <b>117</b> to plug into a corresponding female socket just as in the previous embodiment. A power switch <b>109</b> is also included, with a status indicator LED light <b>109</b><i>a</i>. The switch <b>109</b> is selectively positioned between an on an off position to selectively control power delivered to the AC outlets. These features have already been described in the previous embodiment and need not be elaborated further. All of the features shown and described in the previous embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> are included in the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-13</figref> includes at least two additional features. On the one hand the unit incorporates a map light to provide illumination adjacent the compact inverter device <b>111</b>. The present invention is adapted to be simply plugged into and supported by an in-vehicle-dash DC <b>12</b> socket. The use of the present invention in such a vehicle dash is often in low light settings such as during night time driving. The map light affords the ability to provide a passenger the ability to illuminate an area that does not distract a driver such as overhead cabin lighting when the inverter is disposed in the dash 12 volt outlet. Integration of a map light into the hand held inverter device provides illumination adjacent the device to facilitate making a connection between the inverter and power consuming device in low light settings. The light <b>161</b> includes a clear/translucent spring biased switch plate. The switch plate <b>161</b> is simply depressed between an on and off position. Depressing the switch <b>161</b> overrides a small spring and catches on a retaining device in a lowered position and makes contact to close the circuit to an underlining light, preferably and LED. The clear translucent nature of the switch plate <b>161</b> allows the light to emanate from the switch plate <b>161</b> and provide illumination adjacent the front side of the inverter <b>111</b>. When the switch <b>161</b> is subsequently depressed, the circuit opens and the switch plate <b>161</b> returns to its upright most/off position. Such lights, in and of them selves, are readily available in the market and well understood to those of ordinary skill in the art. The Power inverter housing <b>111</b> is simply molded to accommodate such a switched light <b>161</b> to facilitate easy assembly into the housing <b>111</b>. The electrical connection between the light/switch <b>161</b> and internal circuitry will be easily recognized to one of ordinary skill in the art and is further shown in the schematic representation of the electronic circuitry in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inverter of the present invention also includes an additional outlet <b>171</b> for powering additional DC devices of lower voltage. An additional DC outlet (in additional to the 12V DC pass through device) is also include to power lower level voltage drawing devices such as small hand held video games. Preferably a USP port connection <b>171</b> (such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is included and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This USB connection <b>171</b> provides the ability for external devices to connect to the power inverter/converter to additional supply lower voltage DC power to either run such devices or recharge batteries in these hand held devices. Thus because such devices usually require lower voltages (of the order of 5 volts) a converter is also included in the circuitry to convert <b>12</b> volts to <b>5</b> volts and to maintain the voltage between 4.75-5.25 volts. Thus the power inverter/converter of the present invention includes not only a DC/AC inverter, but a 12 volt DC pass through outlet and converting circuitry to additionally provide lower voltage DC power through a USP port. The combination of a power inverter to provide a Source of AC power through conventional AC outlets with a pass through device to maintain the ability to connect to the 12 Volt source which powers the inverter as well as a converter to additionally provide a lower voltage source of DC power is void in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While this invention has been described as having an exemplary design, the present invention may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains. For example, only a portion of the printed lines are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> sufficient to demonstrate the connection of lead lines <b>19</b> to the circuit as well as the connection of the D.C. receptacle to appropriate lines on the board. Other printed circuitry arrangements may be employed to facilitate a parallel connection between the D.C. outlet and inverting circuitry.</p>
