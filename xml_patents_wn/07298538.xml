<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An apparatus for directing a light path sequentially between multiple positions is disclosed. The optical switch is generally identified as item <b>10</b> in the drawings. The illustrated embodiments of the rotary optical switch <b>10</b> show the use of filters <b>122</b> in the light path.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of one embodiment of a rotary optical switch <b>10</b>. An optical fiber <b>102</b> enters along the axis of a switch body, or support member, <b>104</b> that has photo detectors <b>112</b> mounted radially along the circumference of the body <b>104</b>. Adjacent the optical input port of each photo detector <b>112</b>A, B, C, D, E, and F is a filter <b>122</b>A, B, C, D, E, and F. An optical signal passes through the optical fiber <b>102</b> and into a rotating prism <b>204</b> that directs the optical signal sequentially through each filter <b>122</b> and to each optical sensor <b>112</b>. The filters <b>122</b> and photodetectors <b>112</b> are optical elements that act upon or respond to a light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the switch body <b>104</b> is constructed of a material of low thermal expansion, for instance ceramic or glass or specialty metal such as Kovar, but which is also relatively stiff, having an attractive modulus of elasticity. The switch body <b>104</b> has a size such that the beam of light launched into free space travels a modest distance in free space with minimal dispersion, for example, 10-65 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of the rotary optical switch <b>10</b>. The optical fiber <b>102</b> is terminated in a collimator <b>202</b>, which is aimed at the bottom of a cylindrical prism <b>204</b>. The cylindrical prism <b>204</b> is in a bearing assembly <b>212</b> that is secured in the switch body <b>104</b>. The cylindrical prism <b>204</b> protrudes above the top face of the switch body <b>204</b> such that an optical beam received from the collimator <b>202</b> is directed transversely to the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical prism <b>204</b>. A plurality of filters <b>122</b>A, B, C, D, E, and F surround the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> and are in the light path from the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> to the photo detectors <b>112</b>A, B, C, D, E, and F.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bearing assembly <b>212</b>, in one embodiment, is a stiff bearing. The bearing assembly <b>212</b> is aligned in place and permanently attached in place such that the travel of light from the collimated light from the collimator <b>202</b> through the prism <b>204</b> can reach all the elements <b>122</b>, <b>112</b> in the element field within tolerances and alignments given the experiences of temperature, vibration, aging and shock.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the rotary optical switch <b>10</b>. The collimator <b>202</b> is fixed in a sleeve <b>302</b> on the bottom surface of the switch body <b>104</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sleeve <b>302</b> has opposing slots <b>312</b>A, <b>312</b>B for introducing an adhesive to secure the collimator <b>202</b> to the sleeve <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The cylindrical prism <b>204</b> is centered in a bearing assembly <b>212</b>. The outer race of the bearing assembly <b>212</b> is secured to the switch body <b>104</b>, and the inner race holds the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> and has a pulley <b>214</b> for engaging a belt (not illustrated) that spins the inner race of the bearing assembly <b>212</b>. The drive belt passes through the channel <b>106</b> to a drive wheel (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The diameter of the bearing pulley <b>214</b>, in combination with the drive pulley and the speed of the drive motor, determines the rate at which the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> rotates. Due to the low moment arm of the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> and bearing assembly <b>212</b>, high rotation speeds are achieved. For example, in one embodiment, the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> rotates at 120,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). At this speed, each optical element <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> would be illuminated by the light beam at a rate of 2,000 times per second. If higher sampling rates are desired, optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> are duplicated. For example, in the illustrated embodiment there are six optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>. If opposite pairs of optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> are duplicates, then the effective sampling rate is 4,000 times per second.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a second embodiment of a rotary optical switch <b>10</b>′. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a plan view of the second embodiment of the rotary optical switch <b>10</b>′. In this embodiment, the switch body <b>104</b> carries the filters <b>122</b>A, B, C, D, and E and corresponding mirrors <b>402</b>A, B, C, D, and E. The mirrors <b>402</b> are aligned to reflect the light beam <b>614</b> back to the cylindrical prism <b>204</b>. A single photo detector <b>112</b>′ is aligned with the light beam from the cylindrical prism <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the circular prism <b>204</b> rotates and the switch body <b>104</b> is held stationary, in a manner similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 to 3</figref>. In this embodiment, the light beam <b>614</b> sweeps sequentially through each of the filters <b>122</b> and mirrors <b>402</b> attached to the switch body <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the photo detector <b>112</b>′ provides a timing signal. As the light beam <b>614</b> sweeps around the switch body <b>104</b> as the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> rotates, the light beam <b>614</b> is detected by the photodetector <b>112</b>′ as it passes between two filters <b>122</b>B and <b>122</b>C, thereby providing a timing signal with indexing information for determining the signals corresponding to each of the filters <b>122</b>A, B, C, D, E, and F. That is, the photodetector <b>112</b>′ senses the light beam <b>614</b> once for each revolution of the prism <b>204</b>. The resulting pulse stream from the photodetector <b>112</b>′ provides information on the time it takes the prism <b>204</b> to make one revolution. Knowing the spacing of the other optical elements <b>122</b>, <b>402</b>, it is readily determinable which of the optical elements <b>122</b>, <b>402</b> is affecting the light beam <b>614</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the filters <b>122</b> and the mirrors <b>402</b> are spaced equally circumferentially. The photodetector <b>112</b>′ is aligned to receive the light beam <b>614</b> as it passes between two mirrors <b>402</b>B, <b>402</b>C with their corresponding filters <b>122</b>B and <b>122</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the filters <b>122</b> and the mirrors <b>402</b> are spaced equally circumferentially as if there were one more filter <b>122</b> and mirror <b>402</b>, for example, as if there were seven filters <b>122</b> and mirrors <b>402</b>. In this embodiment, the timing of the photodetector <b>112</b>′ and the light beam <b>614</b> reflected by each mirror <b>402</b>A, B, C, D, E, and F occur at equal time intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> and inner race of the bearing assembly <b>212</b> are held stationary, and the switch body <b>104</b>, carrying the filters <b>122</b>A, B, C, D, and E and mirrors <b>402</b>A, B, C, D, and E, rotates. As the switch body <b>104</b>′ rotates, each of the filters <b>122</b> and mirrors <b>402</b> are rotated sequentially through the light beam <b>614</b>, thereby completing the lighting circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a schematic of the light path through the embodiment of the rotary optical switch <b>10</b>′ illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. A light beam, or optical signal, <b>612</b> is transmitted by the collimator <b>102</b>, through a focusing lens <b>602</b>, through a splitter <b>604</b>, and into the cylindrical prism <b>204</b>. The light beam <b>614</b> is redirected by the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> through a filter <b>122</b> to the mirror <b>402</b>. The light beam <b>614</b> is then reflected back through the filter <b>122</b> and into the cylindrical prism <b>204</b>, after which it is redirected by the splitter <b>604</b>. The redirected light beam <b>616</b> is focused with a lens <b>606</b> and into a photodetector <b>608</b>, which is monitored by a power meter <b>610</b>. In another embodiment, the beam splitter <b>604</b> is replaced with a circulator to separate the optical signal <b>614</b> reflected by the mirror <b>402</b> from the originating optical signal <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The filter <b>122</b> and the mirror <b>402</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are but one of several filters <b>122</b> and mirrors <b>402</b> attached to the switch body <b>104</b>. Each of the filters <b>122</b> and mirrors <b>402</b> are sequentially rotated through the light beam <b>614</b>, thereby completing the lighting circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another embodiment, a circulator is used to redirect the reflected light beam <b>614</b> into a photodetector <b>608</b> coupled to an optical fiber carrying the redirected light beam <b>616</b>. In another embodiment, the lenses <b>602</b>, <b>606</b> are not used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a plan view of a third embodiment of a rotary optical switch <b>10</b>″. In this embodiment, the filters <b>122</b> are mounted on the switch body <b>104</b>′ and a single photodetector <b>112</b> is mounted in fixed relation to the switch body <b>104</b>′, but not in contact with the body <b>104</b>′. The switch body <b>104</b>′ rotates about the bearing assembly <b>112</b> and the cylindrical prism <b>204</b> is held in a fixed position with the light beam directed toward the photodetector <b>112</b>. As the switch body <b>104</b>′ carrying the filters <b>122</b> rotates, each of the filters <b>122</b> enters the light beam sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiments, filters <b>122</b> and photodetectors <b>112</b> are shown as an element in the optical path of the rotating switch <b>10</b>. In various embodiments, other optical elements besides filters <b>122</b> are used such that the light exiting the prism <b>204</b> orthogonal to the bearing centerline bears upon and excites, transmits through, reflects, diffracts, and/or in other ways impacts such elements. For example, in one embodiment, Brag gratings are inserted in the optical path. In another embodiment, a collimator is used to collect the light beam and replace the photodetectors <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, one or more of the filters <b>122</b> are molecular filters that have a spectral signature that is used in the analysis of the transmission, absorption, or reflectance of substances placed in the optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment, one of the filters <b>122</b> is a neutral density filter used to provide a reference. This reference, in one embodiment, is used to provide an indexing or timing signal to aid in the identification of the other filters <b>122</b>. In another embodiment, the reference is used to provide a clean sample from which intensity or other characteristics can be ascertained.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The rotary optical switch <b>10</b> includes various functions. The function of rotating the prism <b>204</b> is implemented, in one embodiment, by the bearing assembly <b>212</b> having a pulley <b>214</b> adapted to be driven by a motor.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The function of rotating the prism <b>204</b>, mirror, or other reflector is implemented, in one embodiment, by the bearing assembly <b>212</b>, which includes the pulley <b>214</b>.
