<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application entitled, “Water Curtain Apparatus and Method,” filed Mar. 17, 2005, having a Ser. No. 11/081,735, now pending, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a water curtain apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to a film or sheet-type water curtain apparatus and method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Water from a reservoir running over a dam, in such a manner as to create a dispersion, is noted to produce aesthetically and acoustically pleasing effects, including a cooling effect as well as a change in humidity in areas nearby. It is noted that this same effect can be duplicated in an artificial waterfall by using a thin angled panel, and allowing water to run down the panel. This panel may also have indentures that cause a rippling effect in the falling water.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cooling our dwellings and workspace today is comprised of two subgroups primarily, heat exchange and evaporative cooling. Heat exchange air conditioning, the most popular, consumes large amounts of electricity, and uses chemicals to transport heat that are considered potentially harmful to the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, heat exchange releases excess heat back into the environment, but recycles the same air over and over again. The “swamp” evaporative cooler is effectively a box containing a fan that draws air through saturated pads to provide cooling and a pump to keep the pads moist. It has remained the same for many decades.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A variation of these subgroups uses evaporation to cool a heat exchanger then passes the cooled air through wet pads, thus reducing humidity. Limitations are inherent to ambient humidity reducing efficacy, and the large volumes of air that must be moved. The use of evaporative cooling and air conditioning when run simultaneously in an area cancel out their cooling benefits, since one introduces humidity and the other removes humidity. Neither of these will work in a passive way since both require energy from an external source.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The recent popularity of misting systems shows that a need for cooling outdoor areas is desirable. These however release large volumes of water into the air and can saturate objects nearby. They are additionally prone to clogging due to mineralization and since they rely on high pressure to mist flooding can occur if compromised.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, indoor air purification systems require constant cleaning and electricity to function. These systems only clean air once it is inside by recirculation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Waterfalls such as those represented by the prior art allow water to collect in an upper reservoir, flow down an angled surface, and collect in a lower reservoir. The water is then re-circulated to the upper reservoir using a pump means, whereby the cycle may repeat.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,368 to Nash shows a waterfall providing a natural waterfall effect with accompanying acoustical effects.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 3,211,378 to Zysk is a wall fountain having a pool of water and a pump for raising water from the pool to a higher lever where it then falls over a vertical wall back into the pool.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The waterfalls described previously, and others like them, all suffer from a number of distinct disadvantages, such as considerable water droplet splashing over a range of several feet from the base of the waterfalls; significant evaporation of water to the point that refill may be required daily; risk of water spillage during relocation of the waterfall; and a large base to house a lower reservoir and a means for returning water to the upper reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, conventional decorative water or waterfall displays are typically constructed for indoor or outdoor use. These water or waterfall displays generally use a plurality of water chambers and wide, flat spouts to create thick and discontinuous streams of water that fall a short distance into the pool or spa below. One of the problems with such devices is that they are primarily designed for use with large volumes of water, which makes it difficult to use the devices in indoor water displays. Moreover, such prior art waterfall displays do not form a continuous film or layer of downwardly flowing water, but rather form thick, turbulent streams which tend to splash and are not particularly attractive as a decorative display. Additionally, the waterfall produced by such devices tends to separate into one or more generally cylindrical streams of water as it falls because of the strong surface tension of water that tends to pull the water flow together. Examples of such devices are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,881,280 to Lesikar; U.S. Pat. No. 5,537,696 to Chartier; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,280 to Ruthenberg.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Decorative indoor water displays are known in the art. However, the known indoor water displays do not create an unsupported film or laminar sheet of water. Instead, such displays are characterized by flowing water over a solid or broken solid surface, such as an inclined or vertical plate. The water adheres to the plate surface as it cascades down. Such displays do not create a transparent film of water, but merely flow water over an existing structure to create a rippling effect. An example of such a device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,747,583 to Dunn et al.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Indoor displays that are used to advertise oil are known in the art. One of the problems associated with the existing advertising display devices is that in order to function, they require the use of viscous fluids, such as lubricating oil. U.S. Pat. No. 1,689,790 to Lefevre, Jr. discloses an oil display device. Lefevre, Jr. however, is limited to maintaining a thin film of viscous liquid. The device relies on the high viscosity of the liquid displayed to create a film. Another problem associated with the Lefevre, Jr. device is that in order to maintain contact between the viscous liquid and two guides, it relies on forming the guides such that they converge at the bottom of the device. As a result of these deficiencies, the device disclosed would not be able to maintain a film of aqueous liquid. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 1,837,225 to Lipski discloses an oil display device for displaying cyclic movement of an oil film, and is adapted for use only with lubricating oils and other liquids with high molecular adhesion. The Lipski device is similarly not suited for low viscosity liquids, such as water or aqueous liquids which have low molecular adhesion and high molecular cohesion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The creation of water screens is not new and numerous procedures are already in use. However the apparatus and materials conventionally implemented present major drawbacks due to complexity of operation, restrictive dimensions, low mechanical ruggedness, bad endurance over time and vulnerability to bad weather.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, until now the proposed systems fail to meet a certain number of requirements. In contrast, the present invention presents a high degree of flexibility in terms of size and shape, and offers a great mobility at low construction and maintenance costs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The adaptability of the process is based on a combination of several significant innovations, such as air permeability and visual transparency thanks to the size of the net mesh; large span construction scalable in terms of both height and width lightness and tolerance thanks to multiple adjustment points; and low volume reservoirs thanks to a maximum water spread.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, it is well known to capture paint overspray whether as a liquid or as a powder by use of water curtains which are placed behind the substrate being painted. The water curtains are provided by directing water downward on a flat support to form a coherent sheet of water which catches the paint particles or droplets. Similarly, the present invention may be configured to passively filter air by placing the water curtain across an opening or passageway allowing filtered air to pass through while increasing its humidity, providing cooling effects and reducing the particulate matter therein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The devices disclosed in the aforementioned patents suffer from many deficiencies as described above. Accordingly, it is desirable, therefore, to provide a decorative, useful, educational, and preferably mobile indoor or outdoor waterfall/water curtain which utilizes a low viscosity liquid, such as water or other aqueous liquid, to form an attractive display of a continuous liquid film along a material drape in order to provide evaporative cooling and filtration of the ambient air.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in one aspect an apparatus is provided that in some embodiments may include a decorative, useful, educational, and preferably mobile indoor or outdoor waterfall/water curtain which utilizes a low viscosity liquid, such as water or other aqueous liquid, to form an attractive display of a continuous liquid film along a material drape in order to provide evaporative cooling and filtration of the ambient air.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an evaporative cooler comprises a housing having an upper surface and at least one vertical wall defining a chamber. The upper surface can include at least one opening in communication with the chamber. The evaporative cooler can also comprise at least one drain slit assembly for distributing a fluid and further comprise at least one screen. The at least one screen can define at least a portion of the at least one vertical wall and the at least one screen can have an interior surface and an exterior surface relative to the chamber. In addition, the at least one screen can be disposed relative to the at least one drain slit assembly such that the at least one drain slit assembly distributes the fluid over the screen. The at least one screen can be configured such that the fluid forms a surface fluid layer over the surfaces of the screen. The cooler can further comprise an air conveyor disposed within the housing. The air conveyor can be configured to draw air through the opening and into the chamber such that the air is conveyed through the screen and the fluid layer. The evaporator cooler can also comprise a base having a catch pool for catching the fluid flowing over the screen and a circulator configured for circulating the fluid back to the drain assembly from the catch pool. In one embodiment, the at least one screen defines a first screen and the cooler can include a second screen. The second screen can be disposed substantially parallel to the first screen such that air drawn into the chamber is conveyed through the second screen. In addition, the at least one drain slit assembly defines a first drain slit assembly and the evaporative cooler can further comprise a second drain slit assembly coupled to the second screen. The second drain slit assembly can be configured to distribute a fluid layer over the second screen. In yet another embodiment, the second screen can be disposed substantially parallel to the first screen such that the second screen serves as a barrier to the fluid layer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment, an evaporative cooler can comprise a housing defining a chamber, air conveyor means configured to draw air into the chamber, drain means for distributing a fluid, and means for screening the air drawn into the chamber. The means for screening can be disposed relative to the drain means such that the fluid is distributed over the means for screening. The means for screening can be configured such that the fluid forms a surface fluid layer over the means for screening.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In yet another embodiment according to the present invention, a method of evaporative cooling comprises drawing air into a chamber and conveying air through a screen. The screen can define a wall of the chamber. The method can further comprise distributing a fluid over a surface of the screen so as to form a surface fluid layer over the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, certain embodiments of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof herein may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional embodiments of the invention that will be described below and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of embodiments in addition to those described and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein, as well as the abstract, are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception upon which this disclosure is based may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The invention will now be described with reference to the drawing figures, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment in accordance with the present invention provides a water curtain or drape assembly <b>100</b> having a drape hood <b>105</b>, material drape <b>110</b>, float overflow shut-off <b>115</b>, collection return <b>120</b>, a drainage line solenoid <b>125</b> which preferably is electric, a drainage line <b>130</b>, a filter <b>135</b>, drape solenoid <b>140</b> which preferably is electric, a drape feed line <b>145</b>, a pump <b>240</b>, a pump power line <b>150</b>, an on/off switch <b>155</b> to a power source <b>160</b> which preferably is a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) power line for obvious safety concerns, a feed line <b>165</b>, and a shutoff valve <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present invention, wherein in one aspect provides that in some embodiments may include a decorative, useful and educational indoor waterfall which utilizes a low viscosity liquid, such as water or other aqueous liquid, to form an attractive display of a continuous liquid film along a material drape <b>110</b> between two limiting elements <b>105</b>, <b>120</b>. The material drape <b>110</b> may be porous or semi-porous and preferably made of a fiber glass mesh fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, wherein the material drape <b>100</b> is disposed within the hood <b>105</b> and suspended from the hood <b>105</b> towards the collection return <b>120</b>. As water or other aqueous liquid is fed from feed line <b>165</b> to the drape feed line <b>145</b> into the hood <b>105</b>, pump <b>240</b> via intake <b>245</b> pumps the water or other aqueous liquid into piston assembly <b>200</b> having a piston <b>203</b>, a magnetic collar <b>205</b>, a piston open position at <b>210</b>, a gutter <b>255</b>, a gutter drain slit <b>215</b>, a gutter groove <b>220</b>, a piston closed position at <b>225</b>, an elastic cord <b>230</b> attached to piston <b>203</b>, a drape material track <b>235</b>, gutter drain <b>250</b>, and a piston sleeve <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The pumped liquid then pressurizes piston sleeve <b>260</b> thereby causing piston <b>203</b> to move longitudinally along sleeve <b>260</b> from the closed position <b>225</b> to the open position <b>210</b>. The magnetic collar <b>205</b> may in effect assist in pulling the piston <b>203</b> to the open position by using a reverse polarity magnetic collar <b>205</b> to attract the piston <b>203</b>. The elastic cord <b>230</b> assists in returning the piston to the closed position <b>225</b> upon the reduction or removal of liquid pressure within the piston sleeve <b>260</b> accordingly. Drain <b>250</b> allows liquid located between the pump <b>240</b> and piston <b>203</b> at the closed position <b>225</b> to be exhausted. Drain slit <b>215</b> allows liquid to flow from the piston sleeve <b>260</b> into the gutter <b>255</b> via the gutter groove <b>220</b> and into the material track <b>235</b>. Once the liquid begins to fill the material track <b>235</b>, liquid will accumulate and flow upon the material drape <b>110</b> disposed within the track <b>235</b> in the direction of the collection return <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The water or other aqueous liquid may flow downward over the material drape <b>110</b> and through one side or both sides of the material drape <b>110</b>, including a wicking effect for upward and downward flows while allowing ambient air to pass through. It should be noted that if a laminar flow of water or other aqueous liquid over the surfaces of the material drape <b>110</b> is created or controlled by the speed or velocity of pump <b>240</b>, evaporation will occur, but the excess moisture while slightly restricting or controlling air movement will have the added benefit of “scrubbing” the air as it moves through the flowing water. This benefit may reduce pollutants, allergens, insects and the like. The gutter <b>255</b> may be filled manually without the use of pump <b>240</b> in some embodiments (not shown). The collection return <b>120</b> may either be independent or attached to a recirculation system as shown. The inline filter <b>135</b> may remove contaminants picked up during the movement of the water or other aqueous liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An ionizing element (not shown) may be incorporated inline to create pH changes in the water or other aqueous liquid for sterilizing purposes. <b>100461</b> The drape <b>110</b> may be mounted for vertical or horizontal movement or retraction or mounted in a fixed manner. If vertically mounted, the drape <b>110</b> may roll to the side or fold when not being utilized. If horizontally mounted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drape <b>110</b> may roll or fold upward or downward with respect to the horizontal.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method provides a pivotal window drape assembly <b>300</b> having pivot hinges <b>305</b>, a latch <b>310</b>, a fixed screen drape material <b>315</b>, a drain opening <b>320</b>, mounting frame <b>325</b>, tubing <b>330</b>, a high volume pump <b>335</b>, collection tray <b>340</b>, collection tray float <b>345</b>, overflow float valve <b>350</b>, solenoid reservoir drain <b>355</b>, a pump power line <b>360</b>, an on/off switch <b>365</b> to a power source <b>370</b> which preferably is a GFCI power line.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this embodiment the window drape assembly <b>300</b> opens inwards within a building or structure and utilizes a high volume pump <b>335</b> to create a waterfall effect upon the fixed screen material <b>315</b>. This waterfall effect provides for a degree of privacy as well as a measurable amount of humidity to interior spaces as air may be allowed to pass.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method provides a walled drape assembly <b>400</b> having a slit <b>405</b>; a gutter <b>410</b>; a pump <b>415</b>; a water main <b>420</b>; a material drape <b>425</b>; a reservoir/catch basin <b>430</b> having sidewalls <b>450</b>, drainage openings <b>460</b> and an overflow level indicator <b>455</b>; a float <b>435</b>; a catch basin solenoid drain <b>440</b>; a catch basin overflow region <b>445</b>; a swivel pump connector <b>465</b>; a water main solenoid <b>470</b>; a pump contact switch <b>475</b>; a feed line <b>480</b>; and a one-way valve <b>485</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The walled drape assembly <b>400</b> is configured to be set back into a wall. The swivel connector <b>465</b> allows for some flexibility in setting the assembly <b>400</b> into a well as desired. The contact switch <b>475</b> turns on the pump <b>415</b> either manually or remotely as desired. The water main <b>420</b> provides water or other aqueous liquid to the pump <b>415</b> and is controlled by solenoid <b>470</b>. The catch basin <b>430</b> retrieves and circulates the water or other aqueous liquid via the feed line <b>480</b>. There is a one-way valve disposed inline with the feed line <b>480</b> to prevent backflow to the catch basin <b>430</b>. The catch basin <b>430</b> utilizes a solenoid drain <b>440</b> in combination with float <b>435</b> to sense and prevent overflow conditions of the basin <b>430</b>. The gutter <b>410</b> receives the liquid from pump <b>415</b> and the liquid subsequently flows from slit <b>405</b> onto drape <b>425</b> accordingly. The drape <b>425</b> may be retractable by use of an elastic spring or stock spring or both (not shown) depending on the size and length of the drape <b>425</b> used. A manually operated embodiment has no pump but may use a seeper hose which moistens the drape <b>425</b> and then fills the catch basin <b>430</b>. However, the catch basin <b>430</b> may overflow and therefore requires manual draining via drain <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method provides a water curtain assembly <b>500</b> having a water gutter <b>505</b>, a water drainage slit <b>510</b>, a material drape <b>515</b>, hydraulic telescopic piston sleeves <b>520</b>, a drape storage cavity <b>525</b>, a water inlet <b>535</b>, a plurality of return drains <b>540</b>, and a diverter pump or dedicated pump <b>545</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The connection between the water gutter <b>505</b> and the piston sleeves <b>520</b> may be configured at a ninety degree angle thereby reducing the flow of water or other aqueous liquid to gutter <b>505</b> and subsequently to slit <b>510</b>. This embodiment may be applicable to hot tubs and the like. A diverter pump or dedicated pump <b>545</b> may provide pressurized water for a hot tub or other primary source <b>530</b> to piston sleeves <b>520</b> thereby causing the sleeves <b>520</b> to expand telescopically from an initial position to a desired height or length. As the piston sleeves <b>520</b> expand, the drape <b>515</b> may freely unravel and move upward with the sleeves <b>520</b>. The water or other aqueous liquid will propagate within the sleeves <b>520</b> into the gutter <b>505</b> and out the slit <b>510</b> upon the drape <b>515</b> creating a water curtain effect. When the water pressure from the pump lessens or ceases the piston sleeves <b>520</b> will lower and return to the initial position and the drape <b>515</b> will reside and be disposed within storage cavity <b>525</b> accordingly. The water or other aqueous liquid propagating down the drape <b>515</b> may be recycled through a plurality of return drains <b>540</b> back to the hot tub or primary source <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although an example of the water curtain is shown using a fiber glass mesh drape, it will be appreciated that other structured materials can be used. Also, although the water curtain is useful to increase humidity in the air flow it can also be used to create insect barriers, sound baffling or barriers, privacy screens or fences, reflect indirect light, grab dust or allergens, perform active cooling with forced air flows, and/or passive cooling with air flows alone.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An illustrative embodiment of an active evaporative cooler and air purifier is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The evaporative cooler <b>600</b> can include a housing <b>602</b> having an upper surface <b>604</b> and at least one vertical wall <b>606</b> defining an interior chamber (not shown). In addition, the evaporative cooler <b>600</b> can include a base <b>608</b> for supporting the housing <b>602</b>. The base <b>608</b> can be configured with casters <b>610</b> or any other device so as to permit the evaporative cooler <b>600</b> to be easily mobile for transport from location to location. The evaporative cooler <b>600</b> can be disposed outdoors, for example to cool a patio area, or the cooler <b>600</b> can be mounted in a window or entryway for outdoor to indoor evaporative cooling of a building or enclosure. The evaporative cooler can further include the electrical circuitry and piping previously described to provide the power, safety and drainage features described in connection with the previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The evaporative cooler <b>600</b> can be generally configured for active cooling in which the surrounding ambient air can be forced drawn into and expelled from the housing <b>602</b>. Accordingly, the upper surface <b>604</b> can include one or more slots or vents <b>612</b> through which ambient or surrounding air can be drawn into the inner chamber of the housing <b>602</b>. Vents <b>612</b> are shown as running in the longitudinal direction of the housing <b>602</b>, but other configurations are possible such as, for example, running in the transverse direction of housing <b>602</b> or being located on a vertical wall <b>606</b> of the housing <b>602</b>. The air drawn into the housing <b>602</b> can be filtered, humidified and cooled by being passed through a material drape or screening element <b>614</b> disposed along a vertical wall <b>606</b> of the housing <b>602</b> with a fluid layer flowing over the surface of the screening element <b>614</b>. The screening element <b>614</b> can be disposed within vertical wall <b>606</b> so as to be framed in a portion of the vertical wall <b>606</b> or alternatively, the screen element can be secured within the framework of the housing <b>602</b> such that the screen <b>614</b> substantially forms the vertical wall <b>606</b> in its entirety. The screen <b>614</b> can be further disposed so as to be substantially parallel to the vertical wall <b>606</b> or alternatively, the screen <b>614</b> can be positioned so as to be at an angle relative to the vertical wall <b>606</b>. As is described in greater detail below, the screening element <b>614</b> can be coupled to a drain assembly such that a fluid can be moved over the screen <b>614</b> so as to filter, humidify and/or cool the air passing through the screening element <b>614</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The housing <b>602</b> is shown as being substantially block rectangular or prism-like in shape. Accordingly, the housing <b>602</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes four supporting vertical walls <b>606</b>. In one embodiment of the evaporative cooler <b>600</b>, the vertical walls <b>606</b> defining the elongate sides of the housing <b>602</b> can be configured with a screen <b>614</b> so as to form parallel evaporative cooling screens. Alternatively, only one of the parallel screens <b>614</b> can be configured for evaporative cooling in which the fluid layer is conveyed over the one screen. The other of the parallel screen element <b>614</b> can be configured to act as a drape, shield or barrier to minimize or reduce the scatter of fluid around and/or external to the housing <b>602</b> that may be dispersed by air moving over the one evaporative cooling screen. Further, each vertical wall <b>606</b> of the evaporative cooler <b>600</b> can include a screen <b>614</b> or further in the alternative, a single vertical wall <b>606</b> can include a screening element <b>614</b>. Generally, the evaporative cooler <b>600</b> can be fitted with as many screens <b>614</b> as can be effectively coupled to or in communication with the drain assemblies of the evaporative cooler <b>602</b> so as to provide the evaporative cooling and filtering effects as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the evaporative cooler <b>600</b> in which the upper surface <b>604</b> and the vertical walls <b>606</b> can define an interior chamber <b>616</b>. Each of the parallel elongate vertical walls <b>606</b> of the housing <b>602</b> has a screening element <b>614</b>. The screening element <b>614</b> defines an interior surface and an exterior surface relative to the interior chamber <b>616</b>. The screening element <b>614</b> can be configured as a single layer element. Moreover, the screening element <b>614</b> can be constructed by weaving, pressing or other forming process so as to form the single layer element.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The screening element <b>614</b> can be further constructed and disposed within the housing <b>602</b> so as to permit air to flow from the interior chamber <b>616</b> to the outer environment. The screening element <b>614</b> can define a mesh opening size so as to provide an airflow suitable for a given application of cooler <b>600</b>. For example, the screen <b>614</b> can include a mesh opening ranging from about 1/64 inch to about ⅜ inch, although other mesh sizes are possible, as required to produce the desired evaporative cooling effect and fluid flow characteristics for air passing through and fluid flowing over the screen element <b>614</b>. More specifically, the mesh size of the screen element <b>614</b> can be configured so as to alter the pressure or air volume requirements of the cooler <b>600</b>. For example, where the mesh size of the screen element is ¼ inch, the cooler <b>600</b> may not need a large air conveyor to move air through the screens <b>614</b> as compared to a cooler <b>600</b> configured with a screen element <b>614</b> having a smaller mesh size. In addition, the mesh openings of the screen element <b>614</b> can be sized and configured so as to effect the fluid flowing over the screen <b>614</b>. The screen element <b>614</b> can be generally configured such that fluid dispensed over the screen <b>614</b> forms a two-dimensional or surface fluid layer. Where the screen element <b>614</b> is configured as a single layer element and fluid flow is restricted to the surface of the screen <b>614</b>, the wet bulb temperature of the ambient air can be optimized or maintained over a longer period of time so as to deliver sustained evaporative cooling of the air. In addition, the screen <b>614</b> can be configured such that fluid flowing over the screen <b>614</b> defines a decorative pattern that can be aesthetically pleasing. Moreover, the screen <b>614</b> can be constructed from a translucent material such that, in combination with the transparent/translucent fluid layer flowing over the screen <b>614</b>, a translucent barrier can be defined to provide privacy and adequate lighting to an area framed or fenced by the evaporative cooler <b>600</b>. To facilitate the visual effects provided by the screen <b>614</b> and the fluid flowing thereover, the housing can be constructed from translucent material.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The upper portion of the housing <b>602</b> can define a hood basin area <b>618</b>. The hood basin area <b>618</b> can include an air conveyor <b>620</b> disposed and configured for drawing air into the chamber <b>616</b> through vents <b>612</b>. The air conveyor <b>620</b> can be, for example, a fan or similar device configured to rotate about an axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the housing <b>602</b>. The air conveyor <b>620</b> can provide the force for expelling the air from the chamber <b>616</b> through the screening elements <b>614</b>. Moreover, the air conveyor <b>620</b> can provide the positive pressure within the chamber <b>616</b> such that air moving through the evaporator <b>600</b> moves from the inner chamber <b>616</b> to the outer environment. Where the screen <b>614</b> has been configured so as to minimize the size requirements of the air conveyor <b>620</b>, the noise generated by the air conveyor <b>620</b> can be minimized or reduced so as not to disrupt the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The hood area <b>618</b> can further provide an area from which the screening elements <b>614</b> can be supported and coupled to or in communication with drain slit assemblies <b>622</b>. Drain slit assemblies <b>622</b> can be configured and disposed relative to the screens <b>614</b> to provide a controlled flow of fluid such as, for example, water over the screens <b>614</b>. The drain slit assemblies <b>622</b> can be configured, for example, in a manner substantially similar to the piston sleeve and gutter assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Accordingly, each of the drain slit assemblies <b>622</b> can be coupled to or disposed relative to a screen element <b>614</b> so as to deposit a fluid film or surface fluid layer over the screen <b>614</b>. The screen <b>614</b> can be coupled to or in communication with the drain slit assembly <b>622</b> such that the fluid film can be deposited on either the interior or exterior surface of the screen <b>614</b>, or alternatively on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the screen <b>614</b> so as to define the surface fluid layer. In addition, the drain slit assembly <b>622</b> can be configured and coupled or disposed relative to the screen element <b>614</b> such that the fluid layer has a continuous laminar flow over the screening element <b>614</b>. Thus air passing through the vents <b>612</b> of the evaporative cooler <b>600</b> can be conveyed through the screen elements <b>614</b> and the flowing fluid layer so as to be filtered and humidified for delivery into the external environment. The fluid layer flowing over the screen elements <b>614</b> can be collected in a re-circulating pool <b>624</b> formed within the base <b>608</b>. The screen <b>614</b> is shown in-part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for ease of viewing to illustrate that the screen elements <b>614</b> can be configured so as to extend into the re-circulating pool <b>624</b> thereby minimizing spill over or splashing of the fluid outside of the housing <b>602</b>. A pumping device <b>626</b> can further be disposed within the base <b>608</b> to circulate the collected fluid back to the drain slit assemblies <b>622</b> through fluid return piping <b>628</b>. Alternatively, the cooling unit <b>600</b> can derive its fluid source externally. More specifically, the cooling unit <b>600</b> can be disposed within, for example, a pool of water, with the base <b>608</b> and pumping device in communication with the pool of water to deliver the fluid to the drain slit assemblies <b>622</b>.</p>

Each drain assembly <b>622</b> can include return piping <b>628</b> feeding circulated fluid from the re-circulating pool <b>624</b> into the fluid holding area <b>630</b> of the drain slit assembly <b>622</b>. The drain slit assembly <b>622</b> can include a slit <b>632</b> configured to secure the screen element <b>614</b> and through which fluid can flow onto the screen element <b>614</b>. Alternatively, the screen <b>614</b> can be secured to a portion of the hood area <b>618</b> and spaced relative to the drain slit assembly <b>622</b> such that fluid can be discharged from the slit <b>632</b> and dispersed over the screen <b>614</b>. The rate of the fluid flow over the screen element <b>614</b> can be controlled by, for example as earlier described, the velocity of the pumping mechanism <b>626</b>. Alternatively, the drain slit assembly <b>622</b> can include a pump independent of pumping mechanism <b>626</b> to deliver and control the fluid flow over the screen element <b>614</b>. Further in the alternative, the flow characteristics of the fluid layer over the screening element <b>614</b> can depend upon the head pressure of fluid above the slit <b>632</b> and the geometry of the slit <b>632</b>.
