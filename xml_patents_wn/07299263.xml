<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to data messages. More specifically, data message mirroring and redirection is disclosed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many contexts, an enterprise or other stakeholder may be required and/or may desire to keep track of and/or exercise control over network or other communications, e.g., communications among employees of a corporation and/or between such employees and third parties, such as the corporation's customers and/or members of the general public. The requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Association of Securities Dealers, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and various anti-harassment and anti-discrimination laws are among the many legal and regulatory requirements that may give rise to a need on the part of a corporation or other entity to be able to monitor, record, archive, index, retrieve, analyze, and/or control employee (or other user) communications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The task of monitoring and controlling communications is made more challenging by the proliferation in recent years of new communication technologies, such as e-mail, chat, instant messaging, and short message service (SMS) technology (the basic text character form of which is sometimes referred to as “text messaging”, e.g., via a mobile phone or other mobile device, and technologies related to SMS such as Enhanced Message Service (EMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), which enable longer messages and rich, multimedia content such as video to be sent. Some modern communication technologies involve the use of mobile communication devices and/or infrastructure beyond the control of the responsible entity, further complicating the task of monitoring and controlling user communications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for an effective way to monitor and/or control communications, including without limitation communications made using mobile and/or data messaging technology.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an apparatus, a system, a composition of matter, a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network wherein program instructions are sent over optical or electronic communication links. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Data message mirroring and redirection is disclosed. In one embodiment, a sending client system or device (e.g., a computer or a mobile communication device such as a mobile telephone) is configured to mirror data messages to a compliance system by encapsulating a copy of each message sent using the client system or device and sending the encapsulated copy to the compliance system. In one embodiment, the same infrastructure that is used to deliver the original message to its intended recipient (i.e., the destination to which the sender addressed it) may be used to send the encapsulated copy of the message to the compliance system. In some embodiments additional and/or different infrastructure may be used. In one embodiment, a sending client device or system may be configured to redirect a data message to a compliance system, which in one embodiment may be configured to relay the message to its intended recipient provided the message is not required to be blocked, e.g., per a policy or other rule the compliance system is configured to enforce.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating data message redirection as implemented in one embodiment. Sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to receive as input, e.g., from a user, message data associated with a message to be sent to an intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, all or part of the message data may preexist on (e.g., in memory) and/or be generated internally by sending equipment <b>102</b>, instead of and/or in addition to being received as input. In some embodiments, the message data received as input by (or generated by or otherwise available to) sending equipment <b>102</b> includes address information associated with intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> and message contents data representing content desired to be sent to the intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>. Depending on the embodiment, the message may comprise an electronic mail message, an instant message, a chat message, data in xml or another suitable format, an SMS text or multi-media message, a voice-mail message, or any other message comprising any one or more types of content suitable for being rendered or otherwise processed, used, and/or stored by intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>. In the example shown, sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to prepare a message intended for intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> based on the message data received as input and redirect the message to a compliance system <b>106</b> via communication path <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to redirect the message to compliance system <b>106</b> by preparing a message addressed to intended recipient <b>104</b> and encapsulating the message in a manner suitable for sending the encapsulated message to the compliance system <b>106</b> via communication path <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the communication path <b>108</b> may be the same as or different, in whole or in part, than the normal path (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) by which the message would otherwise have been sent directly to the intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>. For example, in the case of an SMS text message desired to be sent using sending equipment <b>102</b> to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>, e.g., from one mobile phone to another, in one embodiment sending equipment <b>102</b> would be configured to prepare the SMS text message addressed to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>, encapsulate the SMS text message, and send the encapsulated SMS text message to compliance system <b>106</b> via communication path <b>108</b>. Depending on the embodiment, the encapsulated message may itself comprise an SMS message and communication path <b>108</b> may include at least in part the same or similar communication infrastructure (e.g., the same mobile phone network) as would otherwise (i.e., absent the redirection described herein) have been used to send the SMS text message directly from sending equipment <b>102</b> to the intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the encapsulated message may be delivered to the compliance system <b>106</b> at least in part by other and/or additional infrastructure, e.g., as an e-mail message or other type of data message that includes (in its content or as an attachment, depending on the technology used and the particular embodiment) the message desired to be sent using sending equipment <b>102</b> to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to redirect messages to compliance system <b>106</b> by modifying or otherwise configuring firmware associated with sending equipment <b>102</b> to perform such redirection. In one embodiment, the redirection may be implemented in sending equipment <b>102</b> by hardware design or modification. In one embodiment, the redirection may be implemented by software running on a processor associated with sending equipment <b>102</b>. Any suitable technique for causing sending equipment <b>102</b> to redirect to compliance system <b>106</b> message intended to be sent to recipients such as intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, compliance system <b>106</b> is connected to a database <b>110</b> configured to store data. In one embodiment, the database <b>110</b> is used by the compliance system <b>106</b> to maintain an archive of at least a subset of the data messages sent by sending equipment <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, all messages sent by sending equipment <b>102</b> are archived. In one embodiment, metadata associated with each message sent by sending equipment <b>102</b> is processed to determine whether that message should be archived, e.g., per an applicable policy or other rule the compliance system <b>106</b> is configured to enforce. In one embodiment, all or part of the content of each message (or selected messages) is processed to determine whether that message should be archived. In one embodiment, for those messages to be archived the compliance system <b>106</b> stores the message contents (or a portion or representation thereof, such as an index) and associated metadata in database <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the compliance system <b>106</b> may be configured to implement one or more policies and/or rules for determining which messages sent by sending equipment <b>102</b> are to be archived. In one embodiment, processing may be performed on the message contents and/or associated metadata to enforce and/or monitor compliance with additional policies and/or rules, such as by detecting the unauthorized transmission of proscribed data, such as trade secret or other confidential business information, insider information, information related to a pending transaction, information relating to an ongoing criminal or other investigation, or communications that may be considered harassing, obscene, discriminatory, or otherwise inappropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, compliance system <b>106</b> is configured to quarantine messages that violate a policy or rule the compliance system <b>106</b> is configured to enforce. For example, in one embodiment if a message contains proscribed content, the message may be intercepted by compliance system <b>106</b> and not processed for delivery to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, for messages the compliance system <b>106</b> is not configured to block, the message is relayed by compliance system <b>106</b> to the intended recipient <b>104</b> via communication path <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, compliance system <b>106</b> may be configured to cure or otherwise respond to a message that triggers a policy or rule the compliance system <b>106</b> is configured to enforce, e.g., by modifying the message contents, such as by deleting or changing non-compliant content and/or adding additional content, such as by appending a notice, warning, or other content. For example, in the case of a message that based on processing and analysis by compliance system <b>106</b> is identified as on that may be considered a prediction of future corporate financial results, a standard “forward-looking statement” disclaimer may be appended in an effort to take advantage of the safe harbor provided for such statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating data message redirection as implemented in one embodiment. In this example, the sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to redirect an SMS or other data message to be sent via a mobile network to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> to compliance system <b>106</b> by encapsulating the original message in an SMS (or other) message addressed to the compliance system <b>106</b>. In the example shown, intended recipient <b>104</b> is associated on mobile network <b>140</b> with address 555-1212, which in this example is the fictional telephone number associated with intended recipient <b>104</b> on mobile network <b>140</b>. The compliance system <b>106</b> similarly is associated with telephone number 888-1234. Sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to prepare an SMS message <b>142</b> addressed to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> at telephone number 555-1212 and redirect the SMS message <b>142</b> to compliance system <b>106</b> by encapsulating the SMS message <b>142</b> in SMS message <b>144</b> addressed to compliance system <b>106</b> at telephone number 888-1234.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Note that one or more of sending equipment <b>102</b>, intended recipient <b>104</b>, and compliance system <b>106</b> may comprise equipment that is not mobile equipment, notwithstanding the fact that in the example shown the communications between the various equipments are shown as traversing mobile network <b>140</b>. Any equipment configured to access mobile network <b>140</b> directly or indirectly, e.g., through a gateway, modem, or other device, may be used in the example shown. In other embodiments, networks other than and/or in addition to mobile network <b>140</b> may be used to complete all of part of the communication between sending equipment <b>102</b> and compliance system <b>106</b> and/or the communication between compliance system <b>106</b> and intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>, including without limitation a direct or indirect physical connection or a network connection via the Internet, the public switched telephone network, one or more local area and/or wide area networks, or any other public or private network. In such alternative embodiments, the encapsulated message <b>144</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> would comprise a message having the format and contents required to send the encapsulated message to compliance system <b>106</b> via the applicable communication path(s).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the encapsulated message <b>144</b> is sent by sending equipment <b>102</b> into the mobile network <b>140</b>, where it is processed normally and delivered to compliance system <b>106</b> based at least in part on the address information provided by sending equipment <b>102</b>, e.g., in a header and/or other address portion associated with message <b>144</b> (i.e., in this example telephone number 888-1234). The message <b>144</b> is delivered to compliance system <b>106</b> by mobile network <b>140</b> and processed. In one embodiment, the processing comprises removing the encapsulation and processing the underlying message <b>142</b> intended for intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>, e.g., as described above (e.g., archiving, relaying, blocking, modifying, etc., as appropriate). In the example shown, if appropriate the original message <b>142</b> is relayed by compliance system <b>106</b> to intended recipient equipment <b>142</b>. In this example compliance system <b>106</b> sends the original message <b>142</b> to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> via mobile network <b>140</b>, which processes the messages normally and delivers it to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, address translation, source address spoofing, and/or other techniques may be used to make it appear to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> that the original message <b>142</b> was received directly from sending equipment <b>102</b>, as opposed to from compliance system <b>106</b>. In the example shown, the compliance system <b>106</b> sends to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> the original message <b>142</b> prepared by sending equipment <b>102</b>. In one alternative embodiment, the compliance system <b>106</b> instead prepares for sending to intended recipient equipment <b>104</b> its own message having the same contents as the original message <b>142</b> prepared by sending equipment <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, sending equipment <b>102</b> also is configured to receive messages. In this case there are several methods for processing messages through compliance system <b>106</b>. In one method, the address of compliance system <b>106</b> is the return address of the message sent by sending equipment <b>102</b>. Messages sent by sending equipment <b>102</b> have a reply address which corresponds to the address of compliance system <b>106</b>. In this manner, all messages in reply to messages sent by sending equipment <b>102</b> are actually sent to compliance system <b>106</b>. Compliance system <b>106</b> applies policies and based on these determines if the replied to message is to be sent to sending equipment <b>102</b>. Compliance system <b>106</b> determines the correct recipient from the header information, or through a comparison of known sent messages, or through analysis of the content, or any combination of these. In another method, compliance system <b>106</b> is the message address associated with a user associated with the sending equipment <b>102</b>. For example, the user gives out his/her message address as 888-1234. This is what the user believes is his/her message address. In reality the actual message address associated with sending equipment <b>102</b> is 777-4321. The compliance system is the correct recipient of messages to 888-1234 (i.e. messages addressed to 888-1234 go to compliance system <b>106</b> since that is its address). In one embodiment, compliance system <b>106</b> can receive and process messages addressed to more than one address. Messages are then sent to compliance system <b>106</b> at address 888-1234. Compliance system <b>106</b> applies the relevant policies/rules and takes action accordingly. In one embodiment, if an incoming message is authorized to be delivered to sending equipment <b>102</b>, the responsive action would include sending the message to sending equipment <b>102</b> at its actual (but hidden) address which is 777-4321. This example can also be illustrated using email addresses. In the case of email communications, in one embodiment the user gives out his/her email address as 888-1234@emc.com. This is what the user believes is his/her message address. In reality the actual email address as known by sending equipment <b>102</b> is 777-4321@emc.com. The compliance system is the correct recipient of messages to 888-1234@emc.com (i.e. messages addressed to 888-1234@emc.com go to compliance system <b>106</b> since that is its address.) Emails are then sent to compliance system <b>106</b> at address 888-1234@emc.com. Compliance system <b>106</b> applies the relevant policies/rules and takes action accordingly. In one embodiment, if an incoming message is authorized to be delivered to sending equipment <b>102</b>, the responsive action would include sending the message to sending equipment <b>102</b> at its actual (but hidden) address which is 777-4321@emc.com. Security can be further enhanced my making sending equipment <b>102</b> only receive messages from compliance system <b>106</b> and no other sources. Messages from other sources are rejected. In another method, messages are sent to sending equipment <b>102</b> directly and sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to send an encapsulated copy of the received message to compliance system <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, the message is received by sending equipment <b>102</b> without notification or display to the user (of sending equipment <b>102</b>) pending approval by compliance system <b>106</b>. Upon receipt of a message, sending equipment <b>102</b> sends an encapsulated copy of the received message to compliance system <b>106</b>. Compliance system <b>106</b> applies policies and if appropriate compliance system <b>106</b> archives the message and sends an approval message to the sending equipment <b>102</b>. Upon receipt of the approval message, sending equipment <b>102</b> then displays the message to the user. If compliance system <b>106</b> does not approve of the message, sending equipment <b>102</b> is so informed and the originally received message is not displayed and is deleted. In one alternative embodiment, sending equipment <b>102</b> is configured to send to compliance system <b>106</b> an encapsulated copy of messages it receives but does not wait for any response before allowing the user/recipient to view the message. Compliance system <b>106</b> receives the encapsulated message and processes it according to policies.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process used in one embodiment to redirect a data message. In one embodiment, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be implemented on equipment used to send data messages, such as sending equipment <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Message data is received (<b>302</b>). In one embodiment, all or part of the message data is received via a user interface. In one embodiment, all or part of the message data is generated locally. In one embodiment, all or part of the message data is stored or otherwise available locally. A message to an intended recipient is prepared (<b>304</b>). In one embodiment, the message data received at <b>302</b> may comprise address or other information that identifies the intended recipient. The message to the intended recipient may be generated by creating new content data based on input received locally (e.g., from a user), by incorporating content received from another source (e.g., in the case of a previously received message, file, or other content that is being forwarded or otherwise included in the message), by incorporating content that otherwise preexists locally (e.g., content generated locally at a prior time and stored), or any combination of the above. The message is encapsulated (<b>306</b>). In one embodiment, the original message prepared at <b>304</b> is encapsulated in a manner suitable to redirect the message to a compliance system, such as by encapsulating the message prepared at <b>304</b> within, or otherwise including the original message in and/or appending it to, a message addressed to the compliance system. The encapsulated message is sent to the compliance system (<b>308</b>), after which the process ends (<b>310</b>). In one embodiment, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is performed for each message, e.g., each time a new set of message data is received.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process used in one embodiment to process a redirected data message. The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is implemented in one embodiment on a compliance system, such as compliance system <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. An encapsulated message is received (<b>402</b>). The encapsulation is removed (<b>404</b>). In one embodiment, removing the encapsulation comprises removing an encapsulation header. In one embodiment, the original message is not encapsulated and is instead forwarded as an attachment, and in such an embodiment <b>404</b> comprises opening or otherwise accessing the attachment. Metadata is extracted from the message (<b>406</b>). In one embodiment, metadata is extracted by examining the contents of a header or other message portion comprising address and/or other information associated with the message. In one embodiment, metadata is extracted by analyzing all or part of the message contents. The extracted metadata includes in one embodiment such information as the sender's address, the recipient's address, and data indicative of the contents of the message, such as a sample of the content, one or more keywords, a subject line or field, etc. It is determined whether the message is to be archived (<b>408</b>). In one embodiment, the determination whether to archive a message is based at least in part on metadata extracted in <b>406</b>. In one embodiment, the determination whether to archive a message is based at least in part on the contents of the message and/or the results of an analysis thereof. In one embodiment, a policy or rule may be applied to metadata and/or content associated with a message to determine whether the message is required to be archived. In one alternative embodiment, all messages are archived and <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> are omitted from the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. If the message is required to be archived, the message contents and associated metadata are stored (<b>410</b>). If the message is not required to be archived, or once the message contents and associated metadata have been stored, it is determined whether the message is required to be blocked (<b>412</b>). In one embodiment, a message may be blocked if it fails a test and/or violates a policy or rule. The determination whether to block a message may be based on an analysis of the message contents and/or metadata associated with the message. For example, messages containing content determined to be obscene, harassing, or discriminatory may be blocked. Likewise, message to and/or from a particular address and/or range of addresses may be blocked. A combination of messages contents and metadata may also be used to determine whether a message should be blocked, e.g., to prevent the disclosure of trade secret and/or other confidential business information to a recipient that is not part of the sender's organization. If it is determined that the message is to be blocked, the message is discarded (<b>414</b>) and is not forwarded on to the intended recipient. In one embodiment, the discard process includes sending a notification to the sender and/or an administrator. If the message is not required to be blocked, it is determined whether the message is required to be modified (<b>416</b>). For example, in one embodiment a compliance system may be configured to cure certain defects in a message, such as by deleting offensive language or content and/or replacing such language with more appropriate language or content. In one embodiment, a message that does not satisfy a policy or rule may be cured by appending a disclaimer, warning, or other statement or content to the message. If the message is required to be modified, any required modifications are made (e.g., modifying the content and/or appending any content required to be added) (<b>418</b>) prior to sending the modified message on to its intended final destination (<b>420</b>). Otherwise, the message is sent to the intended final destination in its original form (<b>420</b>).</p>

In one embodiment, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is implemented on sending equipment, such as sending equipment <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Message data is received (<b>602</b>). A message to an intended recipient associated with the message data is prepared (<b>604</b>). The message is encapsulated and sent to a compliance system for processing and to obtain prior authorization for sending the original message to the intended recipient (<b>606</b>). A reply indicating whether the message is authorized to be sent to the intended recipient is awaited (<b>608</b>). If the message is approved (<b>610</b>), it is sent (<b>612</b>). Otherwise, it is discarded (<b>614</b>). In one embodiment, if the message is approved the sending equipment is configured to send the message without further action on the part of a user associated with the sending equipment, with the result that the redirection and pre-approval process is transparent to such a user. In one embodiment, if a message is rejected the sending equipment is configured to provide a notification of the rejection to a user of the sending equipment. In one embodiment, the response from the compliance system may require that the message be modified prior to being sent. In such an embodiment, additional processing not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> would be performed to implement the required modifications. In one such embodiment, the modified message is sent directly to the intended recipient. In one alternative embodiment, the modified message is sent to the compliance system for approval prior to being sent.</p>

An encapsulated message is received (<b>702</b>). The encapsulation is removed and metadata is extracted (<b>704</b>). If it is determined that the message is required to be archived (<b>706</b>), the message and associated metadata are stored (<b>708</b>). It is determined whether the message should be blocked, e.g., for failing to comply with a policy or other rule (<b>710</b>). If the message is to be blocked, a rejection message is sent to the sending equipment that originated the message (<b>712</b>). In one embodiment, a notice is also sent to an administrator and/or the event logged. If the message is not required to be blocked, it is determined whether the message is required to be modified (<b>714</b>). If a modification is required, a qualified approval is sent (<b>716</b>). In one embodiment, the qualified approval message specifies the required modification. In one embodiment, the qualified approval message includes a modified version of the original message in which the required modification has been made. If the message is not required to be blocked or modified, an approval message is sent to the sending equipment to indicate that the message is authorized to be sent in its original form (<b>718</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram illustrating data message mirroring as implemented in one embodiment. Sending equipment <b>802</b> is configured to receive message data, prepare a message to an intended recipient <b>804</b> associated with the data, send a copy of the message to compliance system <b>806</b>, and then send the original message to intended recipient <b>804</b>. The compliance system <b>806</b> is configured to store data associated with at least selected messages in a database <b>810</b>. Compliance system <b>806</b> may be configured to perform other functions, such as generating an alert, log entry, or other notification or event based on an analysis of message content and/or metadata associated with a message of which it receives a copy. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the compliance system <b>806</b> has no way of preventing the message from being sent to the intended recipient. However, the archiving, analysis, monitoring, and reporting functions described herein may still be performed based on the copy received by the compliance system <b>806</b>. In one embodiment, the sending system <b>802</b> is configured to only send the message to the intended recipient once a copy of the message has first been sent to the compliance system <b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process used in one embodiment to provide a copy of a data message to a compliance system. In one embodiment, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is implemented on sending equipment, such as sending equipment <b>802</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Message data is received (<b>902</b>). A message to an intended recipient associated with the message data is prepared (<b>904</b>). A copy of the message is encapsulated and sent to a compliance system (<b>906</b>). The message is then sent to the intended recipient (<b>908</b>), after which the process ends (<b>910</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram illustrating data message mirroring as implemented in one embodiment. In this example, the sending equipment <b>802</b> is configured to first send a message to its intended recipient equipment <b>804</b> and only then send an encapsulated copy of the message to compliance system <b>806</b>. One advantage of the approach used in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is that the message is sent to intended recipient equipment <b>804</b> without delay. One possible disadvantage is that mirroring of the message to the compliance system <b>806</b> may be interrupted, delayed, and/or avoided, at least in theory, by shutting down and/or otherwise disrupting operation of the sending equipment <b>802</b> after the message has been sent to the intended recipient equipment <b>804</b> but before the encapsulated copy has been sent to the compliance system <b>806</b>. The approach used in any particular case may depend on such factors as how critical it is that the data message be timely delivered to the intended recipient equipment <b>804</b> and how essential it is that the message be received and processed by the compliance system. In some embodiments, the approaches illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref> may be combined and each message processed using one or the other of the approaches depending on the configuration of the sending equipment and/or the content of the message and/or associated metadata.</p>
