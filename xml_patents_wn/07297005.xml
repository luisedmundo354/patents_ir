<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a connector pedestal for use in a connector assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the electronics industry, packaging constraints are becoming ever more difficult. The size, weight, heat and location of electronic components are making these requirements an increasing challenge to designers. As such, it would be desirable to have a transition connector which can be used to either raise or lower the position of a connector with respect to a main printed wiring board. It would further be desirable to provide an interface to a mating connector which can be modified to accommodate the dimensions of the mating connector without changing or customizing the connector itself.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides such a transition connector in the form of a connector pedestal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A connector pedestal has a body including interior and exterior surfaces, upper and lower edges, and interface portion, and first and second sets of traces. The interface portion is provided proximate to the upper edge. The first set of traces extends along the interior surface from the upper edge to the lower edge and around the lower edge onto the exterior surface. The second set of traces extends along the exterior surface from the upper edge to the lower edge and around the lower edge onto the interior surface. The connector pedestal is formed by a two-shot or double-shot injection molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a connector assembly, the connector pedestal is mounted to a main circuit board by the traces of the first and second sets proximate to the lower edge of the connector pedestal being soldered to the main circuit board. The connector assembly further includes a guide cage mounted to the main circuit board and a secondary circuit board which is positioned on and guided into position by the guide cage such that the secondary circuit board is positioned off of the main circuit board by a predetermined distance. A connector is further included which is secured to the secondary circuit board and connected to the interface portion of the connector pedestal.</p>

The first molded product stays on the core and is rotated to be placed into a second cavity as an insert and a plateable or non-plateable thermoplastic and is injected therein and molded against the first molded product, commonly known as overmolding, to form a second molded product formed of a combination of the non-plateable and plateable thermoplastics. The second molded product is then subjected to an etching process and electroless plating bath, such that metal from the electroless bath adheres only to the plateable thermoplastic of the second molded product.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the connector pedestal <b>20</b> of the present invention, nearly all of the L-shaped body <b>28</b> is formed with the non-plateable thermoplastic whereas only those portions of the L-shaped body <b>28</b> positioned below the first and second set <b>48</b>, <b>52</b> of traces <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> are formed with the plateable thermoplastic, such that the traces <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> can be formed on the L-shaped body <b>28</b> by the electroless bath. Also, in the connector pedestal <b>20</b> of the present invention, nearly all of the first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> are formed with the non-plateable thermoplastic whereas only those portions of the first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> positioned proximate to the soldering feet <b>76</b>, <b>96</b> can be formed on the first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> by the electroless bath.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The connector pedestal <b>20</b> is preferably utilized in a connector assembly <b>100</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. The connector assembly <b>100</b> includes the connector pedestal <b>20</b>, the connector <b>22</b>, the main PWB <b>24</b>, a guide cage <b>102</b>, and a secondary circuit board <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The connector pedestal <b>20</b> is mounted onto the main PWB <b>24</b> using conventional assembly and soldering techniques. The solder feet <b>55</b> are soldered to the main PWB <b>24</b>, using standard surface mount technology (“SMT”) processing, thus securing the connector pedestal <b>20</b> to the main PWB <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the positioning and soldering feet <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>; <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> of the first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b>, respectively, of the connector pedestal <b>20</b> are provided, these may also be used to properly position the connector pedestal <b>20</b> to the main PWB <b>24</b>, as well as to provide increased hold down strength of the connector pedestal <b>20</b> to the main PWB <b>24</b>. If the first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> are provided with the positioning and soldering feet <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>; <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, respectively, the main PWB <b>24</b> preferably includes two separated pairs of apertures (not shown) therein. The connector pedestal <b>20</b> is mounted onto the main PWB <b>24</b> by positioning the positioning feet <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> of the first wing member <b>60</b> into one of the pairs of apertures of the main PWB <b>24</b>, and by positioning the positioning feet <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> of the second wing member <b>80</b> into the other one of the pairs of apertures of the main PWB <b>24</b>. The soldering feet <b>76</b>, <b>96</b> are then soldered to the main PWB <b>24</b> using conventional techniques in order to secure the first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b>, and thus the connector pedestal <b>20</b>, to the main PWB <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The guide cage <b>102</b>, which is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes a first guide member <b>106</b>, a second guide member <b>108</b>, and a plurality of cross-members <b>110</b> extending between the first and second guide members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. The bottom edges of the first and second guide members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are mounted to the main PWB <b>24</b> using conventional techniques. The upper edges <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> of the first and second guide members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are preferably folded over inwardly toward one another and above the cross-members <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The secondary circuit board <b>104</b> has an upper surface <b>116</b>, a lower surface (not shown) and first, second, third, and fourth edges <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>. The secondary circuit board <b>104</b> is provided with various electronics thereon that must be interconnected to the main PWB <b>24</b>. This is accomplished by mounting the connector <b>22</b>, which is preferably an XFP connector, for instance a <b>70</b> position XFP connector, onto the upper surface <b>116</b> of the secondary circuit board <b>104</b> proximate to the first edge <b>120</b>, and between the second and fourth edges <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The secondary circuit board <b>104</b>, with the connector <b>22</b> mounted thereon, is slid/moved, with the first edge <b>120</b> leading, into the guide cage <b>102</b> between the first and second guide members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and between the cross-members <b>110</b> and the folded-over upper edges <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> of the first and second guide members <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. The connector <b>22</b> is thus mounted on the secondary circuit board <b>104</b> in such a position that the connector <b>22</b> will mate with the interface portion <b>26</b> of the second portion <b>44</b> of the L-shaped body <b>28</b> of the connector pedestal <b>20</b>, as this portion <b>26</b> has a reduced thickness, thus forming the completed connector assembly <b>100</b>. The secondary circuit board <b>104</b> may preferably rest on the cross-members <b>110</b> of the guide cage <b>102</b>. The first and second set <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> of traces <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> thus interconnect the electronics on the main PWB <b>24</b> to the electronics on the secondary circuit board <b>104</b>, through the upper edge <b>40</b> of the pedestal connector <b>22</b>. The upper edge <b>40</b> thereby is a substitute for having a connector to mate with the connector <b>22</b>. Because it is not necessary to have a mating connector, the pedestal provides design flexibility as well as reduced overall system costs and complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that the size of the connector pedestal <b>20</b> and the guide cage <b>102</b> can be varied depending on the desired distance to be provided between the main PWB <b>24</b> and the secondary circuit board <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, which are rear views of the connector assembly <b>100</b>, in partial and whole form, all of the traces of <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> are exposed in the rear, on the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the offset portion <b>46</b> of the first portion <b>42</b> of the L-shaped body <b>28</b> of the connector pedestal <b>20</b>, thus allowing for ease in inspection of the solder joints which join the traces <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> to the main PWB <b>24</b>. Thus, by using half the contacts in the connector <b>22</b>, such as a <b>70</b> position XFP connector, it is possible to route the traces <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> on the connector pedestal <b>20</b> in a way that all of the SMT contacts (traces <b>50</b>, <b>54</b>) soldered to the main PWB <b>24</b>, are exposed on the rear of the connector pedestal <b>20</b>. This eliminates the concern about inspection of the solder joints after assembly for joints that may be under the device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> are provided on the connector pedestal <b>20</b> in order to provide support for the connector assembly <b>100</b> both during assembly and use. As explained, the positioning and soldering feet <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>; <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> may be provided on the first and second wing members <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> in order to provide hold down strength as well as positioning of the connector assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The size of the interface portion <b>26</b> of the connector pedestal <b>20</b> can also be modified as desired, e.g., length, thickness, depth, etc., in order to accommodate the dimensions of the connector <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the foregoing description and the attached claims.</p>
