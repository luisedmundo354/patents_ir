<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a printing apparatus which performs printing by using a printhead having a printing element unit for performing printing and a memory block, the control circuit of the printing apparatus main body outputs a command for acquiring specific information from information held by the memory block. Upon reception of this command, the command control unit of a carriage control unit generates an access signal containing an address for reading out information designated by the command from the memory block. The command control unit accesses the memory block by the access signal, and acquires specific information corresponding to the command from the memory block.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a printing apparatus control method and, more particularly, to a method of controlling a printing apparatus which can read out printhead feature information held by, e.g., an ink-jet printhead.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Printing apparatuses which print information such as a desired character or image on a sheet-like printing medium such as a paper sheet or film are widely used as an information output apparatus in a word processor, personal computer, facsimile apparatus, and the like. These printing apparatuses are used as printers in current business offices, in other business affairs departments, and for personal use. On the other hand, the printing apparatuses have been developed and improved for achieving further cost reduction, higher resolution, and the like while strongly requiring high density and high-speed printing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Of these printing apparatuses, an ink-jet printing apparatus which discharges ink from the orifices of printing elements to perform printing as quiet nonimpact printing can realize high density and high-speed printing because of its structural feature, and is widely spread as a low-cost color printer or the like. The ink-jet printing apparatus performs printing by discharging ink in accordance with desired printing information by using a printhead having a printing element (nozzle) with an orifice and an electrothermal transducer which generates discharge energy for discharging ink from the orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the printhead structure, various printheads in which a plurality of printing elements are aligned in one or a plurality of lines have conventionally been known. In a printhead of this type, N printing elements are designed as one block, and several or several tens of driving integrated circuits which can be simultaneously driven are mounted on a single board. Image data are aligned in correspondence with printing elements, and arbitrary printing is done on a printing medium such as a paper sheet by driving the recording elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With recent increases in resolution and image quality, the printhead performance has greatly been improved. The number of printing elements to be simultaneously driven increases because the number of printing elements has been increased for higher resolution and higher image quality or in order to increase the printing speed. Various types of printheads are proposed in accordance with the performance of the printer main body, and a printhead having, information for identifying the type of printhead is also available. An ink-jet printhead has various pieces of printhead information necessary for the printer main body, such as the ink use amount of an expendable ink cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the printhead, as the number of printing elements to be simultaneously driven becomes larger, energy necessary for driving also becomes larger. A printing element driving method corresponding to the capacitance of a power supply circuit is required. For a printing element which performs printing by using heat, continuous driving of one printing element accumulates heat, changing the printing concentration or destructing the printing element itself. In the presence of a factor such as manufacturing variations, proper printing element energy cannot be obtained for application energy, which degrades the printhead durability or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A printing element is also influenced by an adjacent printing element. For example, in an ink-jet printing apparatus, when adjacent printing elements are simultaneously driven, nozzles receive pressure interference owing to a pressure generated in ink discharge. The pressure interference (crosstalk) may change the printing concentration. It is, therefore, desirable to set an idle time for dissipating heat or avoiding crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, many demands have arisen for driving control corresponding to the printing agent use amount of a cartridge which stores a printing agent, particularly, the ink cartridge use amount of an ink-jet printhead. These demands vary for the difference in ink color information or manufacturing date, the difference in ink viscosity, the difference in use purpose, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To cope with these problems and demands, there is proposed an arrangement in which the printhead incorporates a means for detecting a printhead temperature, a means capable of arbitrarily changing a driving method by an external input signal, and a means for detecting the difference between printheads due to manufacturing variations, and if necessary, pieces of information are extracted and controlled (see, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 7-241992). A circuit arrangement in which printing elements are grouped into a plurality of blocks every predetermined number of printing elements and the blocks are driven in time division is put into practical use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a printing apparatus using such printhead, the number of printing elements in the printhead tends to increase for the purpose of high printing speed and high printing density. Accordingly, the number of blocks in the above-mentioned time division driving increases, and the number of control signal lines also increases even in the use of a decoder circuit or the like. As the image quality and function are improved, the printhead structure becomes complicated, and its control becomes cumbersome, overloading the control unit of the main body apparatus on which the printhead is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, the control unit must manage/execute a control sequence of, e.g., changing a driving pattern in accordance with the operation mode of the printhead, manage and calibrate the influence of the difference in printing state on an image owing to printhead manufacturing variations or the difference between lots, determine the type of head, or sequentially monitor the driving status.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To cope with the above problems, a recent printhead has a data holding function such as a nonvolatile memory (to be simply referred to as a memory hereinafter). The memory stores, as printhead feature information, data such as manufacturing variation information of a printing element or temperature sensor, manufacturing time information containing a printhead manufacturing date, printhead structure information, and a printhead printing dot count value. The printhead memory holds data such as the feature information in a non-rewritable or rewritable state. When, for example, the printhead is mounted on the main body apparatus, all data stored in the memory are read out. Necessary information is reflected in the internal register of the main body apparatus or the like, realizing control corresponding to each printhead. The recording apparatus refers to mapping information which makes the type of information and a storage position correspond to each other, extracts information necessary for control from all data read out from the printhead memory, and utilizes the information for various control operations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In real-time driving control of performing driving coping with, e.g., temperature detection during printing, processing in correspondence with mapping during read of all data (feature information or the like) from the memory decreases the throughput, failing to achieve high-speed, high-image-quality printing. Especially for a thermal head and ink-jet printhead that ejects ink by utilizing heat, the printing temperature greatly influences a printed image. Hence, driving energy control corresponding to the printhead temperature is important, and is an indispensable function for a printing apparatus requiring high-image-quality. The printing apparatus must send a large amount of printing data to the printhead at a high speed, and it is difficult to execute control during detection of printhead information in terms of the processing time.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">More specifically, the printing apparatus is used in various ways with different ink colors at different viscosities. In real-time driving control of performing driving coping with the difference in the ink storage amount of the ink tank (change in negative pressure in the ink tank or the like), processing in correspondence with mapping during read of all data (feature information or the like) from the memory decreases the throughput, failing to achieve high-speed, high-image-quality printing. In a general low-cost nonvolatile memory, the access time to the memory is several 150 μs to 10 ms (write) even for one address. It becomes difficult to leave and refer to the log by frequent accesses.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One problem of the prior art is that read of data from the printhead takes a long time because all data in the printhead are read out to the printing apparatus and necessary data are selected and used in the printing apparatus. This can be ignored when data is read out from the printhead at a timing when a sufficient time can be used for read (e.g., a timing when the printing apparatus is powered on). However, when data must be extracted from the printhead within a short time for the above-mentioned real-time driving control or the like, no long time can be ensured, and many pieces of information cannot be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Every time the number of types of printheads increases, mapping information of the memory for each printhead must also be set, and read processing in the printing apparatus must be changed for each type of printhead. To allow the printing apparatus to extract common specific information from various types of printheads by the same read processing, the memory storage method and storage address must be common between different types of printheads. In this case, the degree of freedom of using a memory for each printhead is greatly limited.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Considering the above conventional drawbacks, it is desired to provide a printing apparatus control method which can efficiently extract information held by a printhead at a high speed, and does not limit the degree of freedom of using a memory regardless of the type of memory and the access method in the printhead.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">“Ink” (to be also referred to as “liquid”) should be interpreted as broadly as the definition of “printing (print)”. “Ink” represents a liquid which is applied to a printing medium to form an image, design, pattern, or the like, process the printing medium, or contribute to ink processing (e.g., solidification or insolubilization of a coloring material in ink applied to a printing medium).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">“Nozzles” include orifices, liquid channels communicating with the orifices, and elements which generate energy used to discharge ink, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view showing an ink-jet printing apparatus as a typical embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a lead screw <b>5004</b> rotates via driving force transfer gears <b>5011</b> and <b>5009</b> while interlocking with forward/reverse rotation of a carriage motor <b>5013</b>. A carriage HC has a pin (not shown) which engages with a helical groove <b>5005</b> of the lead screw <b>5004</b>, and reciprocates in directions indicated by arrows a and b along with rotation of the lead screw <b>5004</b>. The carriage HC supports an ink-jet cartridge IJC. The ink-jet cartridge IJC comprises a printhead IJH and an ink tank IT which stores printing ink.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The printhead IJH includes printheads for monochrome printing and color printing, and either printhead can be properly selected and mounted on the carriage HC by the user in accordance with the purpose. In the use of the printhead for monochrome printing, an ink tank IT which stores monochrome ink (black ink) is mounted. In the use of the printhead for color printing, four ink tanks IT which respectively store four inks, namely, yellow, magenta, cyan, and black inks, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The ink-jet cartridge IJC is constituted by an ink tank and printhead which may be integrated or separable.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Reference numeral <b>5002</b> denotes a sheet press plate which presses a paper sheet against a platen <b>5000</b> in the carriage moving direction. The platen <b>5000</b> is rotated by a convey motor (not shown), and conveys a printing sheet P. Reference numerals <b>5007</b> and <b>5008</b> denote photosensors serving as home position detection means for detecting the presence of a carriage lever <b>5006</b> in a corresponding region and switching the rotational direction of the motor <b>5013</b>; <b>5016</b>, a member which supports a cap member <b>5022</b> that caps the front surface of the printhead; <b>5015</b>, a suction means which sucks the interior of the cap and performs suction recovery of the printhead via an intra-cap opening <b>5023</b>; <b>5017</b>, a cleaning blade; and <b>5019</b>, a member capable of moving the blade back and forth. These members are supported by a main body support plate <b>5018</b>. The blade is not limited to this form, and this embodiment can employ a known cleaning blade. Reference numeral <b>5021</b> denotes a lever which starts suction for suction recovery, and moves along with movement of a cam <b>5020</b> engaged with the carriage. A driving force from the driving motor is controlled by a known transfer mechanism such as a clutch switch.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Capping, cleaning, and suction recovery are executed by desired processes at corresponding positions by the operation of the lead screw <b>5004</b> when the carriage comes to the home-position region. This embodiment can adopt any arrangement as long as desired operations are done at known timings.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A control arrangement for executing printing control of the above-described apparatus will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing the arrangement of the control circuit of the printing apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>1700</b> denotes an interface which inputs a printing signal; <b>1701</b>, an MPU; <b>1702</b>, a ROM which stores a control program executed by the MPU <b>1701</b>; <b>1703</b>, a DRAM (to be referred to as a RAM hereinafter) which stores various data (printing signal, printing data supplied to the head, and the like); and <b>1704</b>, a gate array (G.A.) which controls supply of printing data to a printhead IJH, and also controls data transfer between the interface <b>1700</b>, the MPU <b>1701</b>, and the RAM <b>1703</b>. A control circuit <b>101</b> has this arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Reference numeral <b>1709</b> denotes a convey motor (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for conveying a printing sheet P; <b>1706</b>, a motor driver for driving the convey motor <b>1709</b>; and <b>1707</b>, a motor driver for driving the carrier motor <b>5013</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The operation of the control arrangement will be explained. When a printing signal is input to the interface <b>1700</b>, the printing signal is converted into printing data between the gate array <b>1704</b> and the MPU <b>1701</b>. The motor drivers <b>1706</b> and <b>1707</b> are driven, and the printhead IJH is driven through a carriage control unit <b>102</b> in accordance with the printing data sent to the carriage HC to print an image on the printing sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For optimal driving in driving the printing element unit of the printhead IJH, the driving condition of each printing element is determined by referring to feature information held in the memory <b>131</b> of the printhead IJH.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing a basic arrangement for acquiring feature information stored in the memory <b>131</b> of a printhead IJH according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The printhead IJH comprises a printing element which performs printing in accordance with a received control command and an arrangement which outputs various pieces of feature information on printing. Similar to the prior art, the printhead IJH is mounted on the carriage HC and electrically connected to it. The printhead IJH and carriage HC can be electrically connected by various methods such as a contact pad having a gold-plated terminal. A carriage control unit <b>102</b> in the carriage HC can selectively read out printhead feature information from the printhead IJH in accordance with a control command sent from the main body control unit. This function of the carriage control unit <b>102</b> allows even a conventional printhead to acquire printhead feature information in accordance with a control command from the main body control circuit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing a control instruction communication system according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Outline arrows represent control instruction line transmission, and black arrows represent general signal exchange. The first embodiment assumes, e.g., a sequence of issuing an instruction for acquiring printhead manufacturing variation information from the printhead (control instruction line <b>1</b>), reading the manufacturing variation information from a predetermined area of the memory <b>131</b> in the printhead IJH as driving control information based on the instruction (read line), and correcting printing energy on the basis of the information (control instruction line <b>2</b>). For example, the manufacturing variation information is information available to correct variations of printhead temperature sensor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">If control instruction line <b>1</b> is executed in the control circuit <b>101</b> of the printing apparatus, the control circuit <b>101</b> sends a control instruction <b>111</b> for “reading out” “driving control information” of the printhead, to the carriage. In the carriage control unit <b>102</b>, the control instruction <b>111</b> is received by a memory control unit <b>121</b>. The memory control unit <b>121</b> reads out and acquires necessary information from a memory <b>131</b> of the printhead IJH in accordance with the received control instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart for explaining the control instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The operation of the command control unit <b>120</b> which has received the control instruction <b>111</b> will be explained with reference to the flow chart.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The command control unit <b>120</b> waits for transmission of a control instruction from the control circuit <b>101</b> in step S<b>101</b>, and if receives the control instruction <b>111</b>, determines the type of control instruction (whether the control instruction is a memory read instruction) in step S<b>102</b>. If the received control instruction <b>111</b> is determined to be a memory read instruction, the processing advances to step S<b>103</b> (the control instruction is transferred to the memory control unit <b>121</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Processes in steps S<b>103</b> to S<b>106</b> are executed by the memory control unit <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step S<b>103</b>, an address at which information designated by the control instruction <b>111</b> is stored is acquired among addresses in the nonvolatile memory (memory block <b>131</b>) of the ink-jet head IJH. In the example of the first embodiment, an address at which driving control information is stored is acquired. In step S<b>104</b>, the command control unit <b>120</b> generates an access signal (memory read instruction+address) <b>122</b> to the memory <b>131</b> so as to read information from the address.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Information representing the correspondence between information and its storage address in the memory <b>131</b> is held as a table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by the memory control unit <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, an address corresponding to information (information identification name) designated by the control instruction <b>111</b> is obtained by looking up the table, and a proper access signal <b>122</b> is generated as a control signal. In this example, read of driving control information is designated, and an access signal is so generated as to read information stored at addresses 0xSSSS to 0xTTTT. Driving control information is read out from the memory <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In order to cope with a plurality of types of printheads, a table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is prepared for each printhead, and an access signal is generated by looking up a table corresponding to a currently mounted printhead. A plurality of types of tables are stored in the memory of the memory control unit <b>121</b> in advance, and a table to be looked up is selected and used from head type information of the mounted printhead. In this case, the storage address of the head type information in the memory <b>131</b> must be common between all types of printheads. Alternatively, a table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be stored at a predetermined address in the memory of the printhead, and read out and held by the command control unit <b>120</b> upon mounting the printhead (or powering on the apparatus).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this way, in step S<b>104</b>, the memory control unit <b>121</b> generates an access signal by using the address acquired in step S<b>103</b>, and accesses the memory block <b>131</b> in accordance with the access signal <b>122</b>. Thus, only necessary information can be read from the memory. Then in step S<b>105</b>, the memory control unit <b>121</b> reads out the information (driving control information) designated by the control instruction <b>111</b>, and acquires the information as memory read data <b>123</b>. In step S<b>106</b>, the acquired memory read data <b>123</b> is sent to the control circuit <b>101</b> which has issued the control instruction <b>111</b> (read line), as the execution result (memory read data <b>112</b>) of control instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the above example, the carriage control unit <b>102</b> sends back the read printhead driving control information to the control circuit <b>101</b>. The driving control information may be utilized for feedback control in the carriage control unit <b>102</b>. When the control system must control driving in real time, control is completed by only the carriage control unit <b>102</b>, thereby quickly controlling the printhead. This example will be described in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At the end of control instruction line <b>1</b> by the control circuit <b>101</b>, control instruction line <b>2</b> is executed in accordance with the sequence. In control instruction line <b>2</b>, “driving energy change information” is transferred as a “control instruction”. More specifically, driving energy change information is generated on the basis of the memory read data <b>112</b> (driving control information) acquired by control instruction line <b>1</b>. A command <b>113</b> of changing driving control of the printing element is generated in accordance with the driving energy change information.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this processing, if reception of a command is confirmed in step S<b>101</b>, the received command is determined in step S<b>102</b> not to be a memory read instruction. The processing advances to step S<b>107</b> to determine whether the received command is a head driving control instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the command control unit <b>120</b> of the carriage control unit <b>102</b> determines that the control instruction <b>113</b> has been received, the processing advances from step S<b>107</b> to step S<b>108</b>. Steps S<b>108</b> and S<b>109</b> are executed by a driving control unit <b>124</b>. The driving control unit <b>124</b> changes energy in accordance with the driving energy change information of the control instruction <b>113</b>, and transmits the instruction to a head driving control unit <b>132</b>. Optimal driving of each printing element in a printing element unit <b>134</b> can therefore be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">If another control instruction is received, the processing advances to step S<b>110</b> to execute corresponding processing. For example, the cumulative driving count of the printing element may be written in the memory at a specific timing, or the information may be properly read out to perform head driving optimal for the cumulative driving count. Several control operations by memory access are conceivable, but a description of these processes will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram for explaining the arrangement of a printhead applicable to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the printhead IJH is divided into a head block <b>130</b> and the memory block <b>131</b>.

When the memory capacity of the memory block <b>131</b> is large, the memory block <b>131</b> may be mounted separately from the head block <b>130</b>. The head block <b>130</b> incorporates the printing element unit <b>134</b>, the head driving control unit <b>132</b>, and a head detection unit <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the printing element unit <b>134</b> has a plurality of printing elements <b>1</b> which are in one-to-one correspondence with circuit elements (to be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) in the head driving control unit <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the head detection unit <b>133</b> incorporates a printhead temperature sensor <b>12</b> and a resistance element <b>11</b> for correcting and monitoring proper application energy to the printhead (resistance element for monitor). When control relating to detection of the sensor is completed, the head detection unit <b>133</b> may include a control circuit which functions these units. For an arrangement capable of outputting logic, an arrangement <b>10</b> may be included.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the memory block <b>131</b>, reference numeral <b>23</b> denotes a printhead memory block which holds printhead data in correspondence with an individual address. For example, the contents of the memory block <b>23</b> are manufacturing variation information on the printing element in the printing element unit <b>134</b> or the temperature sensor in the head detection unit <b>133</b>, manufacturing time information containing a printhead manufacturing date, printhead structure information, and a printhead printing dot count value (rewritable).

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the control unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, reference numeral <b>6</b> denotes an AND circuit which outputs a control signal of the function element <b>2</b>; <b>7</b>, a decoder; <b>8</b>, a latch; and <b>9</b>, a shift register. Reference symbol CLK denotes a clock signal; DATA, an image data signal; LAT, a latch pulse; BENB, a block selection signal; and ENB, a driving pulse signal. When the image data signal DATA is input, image data are sequentially transferred to the shift register <b>9</b> in response to the image data transfer clock CLK, and aligned in the latch <b>8</b> in correspondence with respective printing elements.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the block selection signals BENB are sequentially activated within the cycle of the latch pulse signal LAT, and as a result, time division driving can be achieved.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a printing apparatus having various printing modes, the pattern of the block selection signals BENB input to the decoder <b>7</b> in the cycle of the latch pulse signal LAT may not be kept constant but may be changed depending on the printing mode.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As the above-described circuit arrangement, many circuit arrangements have been proposed in accordance with the printing element driving method. In order to minimize the circuit arrangement, the circuit may be comprised of a latch circuit, and shift registers which can sequentially drive blocks obtained by grouping printing elements into several blocks. For a long printhead in which image data is transferred in advance and the divisional driving order can be arbitrarily set in the next cycle, the circuit may preferably comprise a latch circuit, and shift registers corresponding to printing elements. The divisional control circuit <b>7</b> is a circuit such as a decoder or shift register.</p>

This arrangement makes it possible to reliably acquire only information necessary for the printing apparatus main body even in the use of a printhead having a different memory specification or different feature information storage address. The degree of freedom of the printhead memory design also increases.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The command control unit adopted to implement an arrangement in which a command from the printing apparatus is interpreted and necessary data is acquired can be arranged in the carriage of the printing apparatus, similar to the second embodiment, the printhead, similar to the third embodiment, or the element base which constitutes the printhead (element base having a heating element).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As described in detail above, according to the embodiment, printhead control by the printing apparatus main body can be simplified into command communication even for complicated driving control accompanying the improvement of the printhead function. Processing can be completed within a short time because, for example, even access to the memory which is arranged in the printhead and holds pieces of information can be controlled by accessing, reading out, and referring to arbitrary information. These control operations can be executed in parallel with another processing, greatly shortening the conventional printhead control time.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The arrangement according to each embodiment is achieved by setting a command format corresponding to the printhead. The command format functions as a control line which links the printhead and the printing apparatus supporting the printhead. In the use of a conventional printhead, the carriage control unit controls a command from the control unit of the printing apparatus main body in accordance with the purpose, which provides a command format system.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Even if the printhead is further advanced, the advanced printhead can be exploited by adding a command format corresponding to the advanced function. The command system is held, and a conventional command can be kept utilized. More advanced control can also be realized using a sequence command which is a combination of commands.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Control according to the present invention can be applied regardless of the electrical/mechanical arrangement, software sequence, and the like as long as the present invention provides an arrangement which links the printing apparatus, carriage control unit, and print head by command communication.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The above embodiments have been explained by assuming that a droplet discharged from a printhead is ink and a liquid contained in an ink tank is ink. However, the content of the ink tank is not limited to ink. For example, the ink tank may contain a processing solution to be discharged onto a printing medium to increase the fixing properties, water resistance, or quality of a printed image.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The above-described embodiments have exemplified an ink-jet printing apparatus. However, the present invention can also be applied to another type of printing apparatus such as a thermal printing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The above embodiments can increase the density and resolution of printing by using a system which includes a means (e.g., an electrothermal transducer or laser beam) for generating heat energy as energy used to discharge ink and causes a state change of ink by this heat energy, among other inkjet printing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As the typical arrangement and principle, it is preferable to use the basic principle disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,723,129 and 4,740,796. This system is applicable to both a so-called on-demand apparatus and continuous apparatus. The system is particularly effective in an on-demand apparatus because at least one driving signal which corresponds to printing information and gives a rapid temperature rise exceeding nucleate boiling is applied to an electrothermal transducer which is arranged in correspondence with a sheet or channel holding a liquid (ink), heat energy is generated by the electrothermal transducer to effect film boiling on the heat acting surface of the printhead, and consequently a bubble can be formed in the liquid (ink) in one-to-one correspondence with the driving signal. The liquid (ink) is discharged from an orifice by growth and shrinkage of this bubble, forming at least one droplet. This driving signal is more preferably a pulse signal because growth and shrinkage of a bubble are instantaneously appropriately performed to discharge the liquid (ink) with a good response characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">This pulse driving signal is preferably a signal described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,463,359 or 4,345,262. Note that superior printing can be performed by the use of conditions described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,313,124 which is the invention concerning the rate of temperature rise on the thermal action surface.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The above embodiments concern a serial type printing apparatus which scans a printhead to perform printing. The printing apparatus may be a full-line type printing apparatus using a printhead having a length corresponding to the width of a printing medium. The full-line type printhead can take a structure which attains this length by combining a plurality of printheads as disclosed in the above-mentioned specifications, or can be a single integrated printhead.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In addition, it is possible to use not only a cartridge type printhead explained in the above embodiments in which an ink tank is integrated with a printhead itself, but also an interchangeable chip type printhead which can be electrically connected to an apparatus main body and supplied with ink from the apparatus main body when attached to the apparatus main body.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">It is preferable to add a printhead recovery means or preliminary means to the arrangement of the printing apparatus because printing operation can further stabilize. Concrete examples of the additional means are a capping means for the printhead, a cleaning means, a pressurizing or suction means, an electrothermal transducer, another heating element, and a preliminary heating means as a combination of the electrothermal transducer and heating element. A predischarge mode in which discharge is performed independently of printing is also effective for stable printing.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The printing mode of the printing apparatus is not limited to a printing mode using only a main color such as black. The apparatus can adopt at least either of a composite color mode using different colors and a full color mode using color mixture, regardless of whether the printhead is an integrated head or a combination of a plurality of heads.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The above embodiments assume that ink is a liquid. It is also possible to use ink which solidifies at room temperature or less and softens or liquefies at room temperature. A general inkjet system performs temperature control such that the viscosity of ink falls within a stable discharge range by adjusting the ink temperature within the range of 30° C. (inclusive) to 70° C. (inclusive). Hence, ink need only be a liquid when a printing signal used is applied to it.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The printing apparatus according to the present invention can take the form of any of an integrated or separate image output terminal of an information processing apparatus such as a computer, a copying apparatus combined with a reader or the like, and a facsimile apparatus having a transmission/reception function.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As has been described above, according to the present invention, necessary information can be efficiently extracted at a high speed from information held by a printhead.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Also, the degree of freedom of using a memory mounted in the printhead can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the claims.</p>
