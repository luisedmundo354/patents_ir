<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a national phase application of International Application No. PCT/JP2004/002681 filed on Mar. 3, 2004, and claims priority from such International application pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 365. In addition, the present application claims priority from Japanese Application No. 2003-059027 filed on Mar. 5, 2003. The entire disclosures of the above-identified International and Japanese applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cationic electrodeposition coating composition substantially free of lead compounds, which is excellent in curability and can be finish-coated with a splendid appearance, and an article coated with the composition.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cationic electrodeposition coating compositions have been used for undercoating bodies and parts of automobiles, and required to form coating films with high corrosion resistance. The coating films need to be sufficiently cured at a predetermined baking temperature to achieve the high corrosion resistance. Dibutyltin compounds are generally used as a curing catalyst for lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating compositions. For example, dibutyltin oxide, which is usable as a catalyst for cross-linking reaction of a cationic electrodeposition coating composition, is described in JP-A-5-65438. Further, a cationic electrodeposition coating composition containing an organotin compound is disclosed in JP-A-7-258586, and a cationic electrodeposition coating composition containing a dialkyltin aromatic carboxylic acid salt as a curing catalyst is disclosed in JP-A-2001-55538.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in general, the dibutyltin compounds are disadvantageously volatile. For example, surface temperature of electrodeposition coating films is raised to 150 to 180° C. in a process of baking the films, coating the film with an upper film of a chipping primer, an intermediate coating, etc., or baking the upper film. The dibutyltin compounds are volatilized from the surface of the electrodeposition coating films at such a high temperature, transferred into the adjacent upper film of the chipping primer or the intermediate coating, and thereby negatively affects the film performances or appearance of the finish coating film in some cases.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a lead-free electrodeposition coating composition excellent in curability and a coated article, the composition being capable of forming a coating film, which emits less tin compounds to have no influence on appearance of a finish coating film and film performances.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention comprises a binder resin and one or more organotin compounds as a curing catalyst, wherein the binder resin comprises a cationic base resin and a crosslinking agent, the mass ratio of the organotin compounds to the solid contents of the binder resin is 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the organotin compounds comprise more than 50% by mass of a monoalkyltin compound based on the total mass of the organotin compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention preferably comprises 100 to 2,000 ppm of zinc ions. And the cationic base resin is preferably an amino-epoxy resin. The monoalkyltin compound may be monobutyltin oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A coated article of the present invention comprises a substrate and an electrodeposition coating film formed thereon, which comprises the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition. The coated article has at least a film of a chipping primer on the electrodeposition coating film in many cases. In the present invention, the excellent film performances can be achieved even in the case where the chipping primer is such that the adhesion or the appearance is negatively affected easily by transfer of tin atoms from the electrodeposition coating film.</p>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is described in detail below. In the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention, the term “lead-free” means that the composition substantially contains no lead (including lead in lead compounds). The detection limit of lead has been lowered year after year by advancement of analytical instruments, and in the present invention, the term “lead-free” specifically means that the lead content of the composition is 10 ppm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention comprises one or more organotin compounds as a curing catalyst (or a dissociation catalyst for a blocked polyisocyanate compound). The organotin compounds comprise the monoalkyltin compound. The monoalkyltin compound is particularly preferably monobutyltin oxide though there are no particular restrictions thereon. Examples of the monoalkyltin compounds include monobutyltin trioctanoate, monobutyltin triacetate, monobutyltin tribenzoate, monobutyltin trioctylate, monobutyltin trilaurate, monobutyltin trimyristate, monomethyltin triformate, monomethyltin triacetate, monomethyltin trioctylate, monooctyltin triacetate, monooctyltin trioctylate, monooctyltin trilaurate, monolauryltin triacetate, monolauryltin trioctylate, and monolauryltin trilaurate. These alkyltin compounds may be used singly or in combination of 2 or more compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The monoalkyltin compound may be used with other organotin compounds. Examples of the other organotin compounds include dialkyltin compounds such as dibutyltin oxide, dioctyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate, and dibutyltin diacetate. In the present invention, the mass ratio of the monoalkyltin compound to the total of the organotin compounds needs to be more than 50% by mass. When the mass ratio is 50% by mass or less, the excess other organotin compounds are transferred into a film adjacent to the electrodeposition coating film to worsen the film performances and the appearance of the finish coating film. The mass ratio of the monoalkyltin compound to the total of the organotin compounds is preferably 60 to 100% by mass, more preferably 75 to 100% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the mass ratio of the organotin compounds to the solid contents of the binder resin comprising the cationic base resin and the crosslinking agent is less than 0.1% by mass, the catalytic activity is insufficient. On the other hand, when the mass ratio of the organotin compounds is increased to more than 10% by mass, the catalytic activity cannot be correspondingly improved, and further, there is a case where the electrodeposition coating film is decomposed by over baking. The mass ratio of the monoalkyltin compound to the solid contents of the binder resin comprising the cationic base resin and the crosslinking agent is preferably 0.5 to 7.0% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method for introducing the organotin compounds into the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition is not particularly restricted. In the case where the organotin compounds are solid, the organotin compounds is preferably dispersed using a dispersing resin as well as pigments. Further, in the case where the organotin compounds are liquid, they may be dissolved in or mixed with the binder resin and introduced as a part of the binder component.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention may contain zinc ions. An inorganic zinc compound such as zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide or an organic zinc compound may be used to maintain the zinc ion content of the composition at the predetermined degree. The zinc compounds may be used alone or in combination of 2 or more compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Examples of the organic zinc compounds include zinc salts of organic mono- or di-acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid, octylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, neodecanoic acid, acrylic acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, undecylenic acid, oleic acid, erucic acid, sorbic acid, linolic acid, linolenic acid, bisphenylacetic acid, bisphenylbutyric acid, bisphenylpropionic acid, biscyclopentane carboxylic acid, bisacetoacetic acid, benzoic acid, methylbenzoic acid, bismethoxybenzoic acid, bis(tert-butyl)benzoic acid, bishydroxybenzoic acid, phthalic anhydride, terephthalic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, and fumaric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The zinc ion content of the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition is preferably 100 to 2,000 ppm, more preferably 300 to 1,000 ppm. When the zinc ion content is less than 100 ppm, there is a case where the dissociation catalyst to be hereinafter described cannot show sufficient activity, resulting in insufficient curing of the electrodeposition coating film. On the other hand, when the zinc ion content is more than 2,000 ppm, appearance of the film and the electrodeposition coating workability are deteriorated in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cationic base resin used in the present invention is preferably such that the electrodeposition coating film has higher corrosion resistance. Examples of such cationic base resins include amino-epoxy resins, amino group-containing acrylic resins, amino group-containing polyester resins, etc. Among them, preferred are amino-epoxy resins. The amino-epoxy resins can be obtained that epoxy rings of an epoxy resin is opened by an amine compound such as an acid salt of a primary, secondary or tertiary amine, and cationized.</p>

The epoxy resin is preferably the modified epoxy resin having an oxazolidone ring. The modified epoxy resin can be obtained by a dealcoholization reaction of an epoxy resin with a bisurethane compound prepared by a reaction between a diisocyanate compound and one active hydrogen compound or with a heterourethane compound prepared by a reaction between a diisocyanate compound and 2 or more active hydrogen compounds.

The etherified melamine resins are obtained by etherifying melamine with an alcohol such as methanol and butanol. The etherified melamine resin is subjected to a transetherification with the cationic base resin to promote the crosslinking reaction in the baking process after the electrodeposition coating as the blocked polyisocyanate compound.</p>

The amount of the other dissociation catalyst may be 200 parts by mass or less per 100 parts by mass of the organotin compounds of the main catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, crosslinking resin particles, pigments, and various additives may be added to the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention if necessary. Efficiency of maintaining the thickness of the edge portion of the coated article can be improved by adding the crosslinking resin particles. The crosslinking resin particles may be generated from an acrylic resin, an epoxy resin, a phenol resin, a melamine resin, etc. The crosslinking resin particles are particularly preferably such as using an acrylic resin from the viewpoint of production easiness.

In the case where the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition contains such a pigment, the composition may further contain a resin for dispersing the pigment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention is preferably prepared by dispersing the components in an aqueous medium of the organic solvent and water containing the above-mentioned water-soluble organic acid or the above-mentioned inorganic acid as the neutralizer.</p>

The composition may be electrodeposited onto the conductive substrate to form the electrodeposition coating film, which may be coated with an overcoating film if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The conductive substrate may comprise any material that can be electrodeposition-coated, such as iron materials, steel materials, and aluminium materials. It is preferred that the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention is diluted with deionized water to have the solid concentration of 5 to 40% by mass, preferably 15 to 25% by mass, and the pH value of the composition is adjusted to 5.5 to 8.5, and then the composition is introduced into an electrodeposition bath, to form the electrodeposition coating film. The electrodeposition coating is preferably carried out under conditions of an electrodeposition bath temperature of 20 to 35° C., a coating voltage of 100 to 450 V, and a coating time of 1 to 5 minutes.

Examples of such polyolefins include ethylene-propylene copolymers containing 50 mol % or more of propylene, and the acid component of the acid-grafted polyolefin may be maleic acid, maleic anhydride, etc. Such maleated polyolefin resins are described in JP-A-9-208882, JP-A-4-363371, etc., and T-5H manufactured by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd., BOR-904 manufactured by Sakai Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., etc. are commercially available maleated polyolefin resins. In the coated article of the present invention, a large amount of the monoalkyltin compound is used as the catalyst for curing the electrodeposition coating film as described above, whereby the amount of the dialkyltin compounds is relatively small. Thus, only a small amount of the dialkyltin compounds are volatilized in the process of baking each films, etc., whereby the coated article excellent in film performances and appearance can be obtained even in the case where the chipping primer is such that the adhesion or the appearance is negatively affected easily by transfer of tin atoms from the electrodeposition coating film.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It was clear from the above results that the lead-free electrodeposition coating compositions, which contain a particular amount of the monobutyltin compound and a particular concentration of the zinc ions based on the solid contents of the binder resin comprising the cationic base resin and the crosslinking agent, showed sufficient film curability and emitted less tin compounds. On the other hand, the composition of Comparative Example 1 using a small amount of dibutyltin oxide showed insufficient film curability, and the compositions of Comparative Examples 2 and 3 using a large amount of dibutyltin oxide emitted more tin compounds, thereby resulting in reduction of adhesion between the coating films.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention contains a particular amount of the monoalkyltin compound to show excellent film curability. Further, the monoalkyltin compound has low volatility, and thereby, is hardly transferred to the chipping primer film or the intermediate coating film in the processes of forming the electrodeposition coating film. Thus, the composition can form the electrodeposition coating film with excellent film performances. Furthermore, the amino-epoxy resin can be used as the cationic base resin to increase the corrosion resistance. Therefore, the coated article of the present invention can be used for products requiring high quality and splendid appearance, such as automobile bodies and home electric appliances.</p>
