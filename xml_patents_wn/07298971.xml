<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is related to the field of optical communications, and in particular, to communication systems the provide hybrid ring/mesh protection.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Communication nodes may exchange communications with one another over a work path in an optical ring. If the work path in the optical ring experiences a fault, the nodes may transfer the affected communications over a protect path in the opposite direction around the optical ring. The protect path must have the same capacity as the work path. Unfortunately, the protect path may be much longer than the work path and costly to implement.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Line protection may be used as an alternative to path protection in the optical ring. A work path is typically comprised of a series of work lines that are coupled together to form the work path. These work lines can have corresponding protect lines that are physically or geographically diverse from the work lines. If a work line in the optical ring experiences a fault, the nodes may transfer the affected communications over a corresponding protect lineâ€”possibly in the opposite direction around the optical ring. The protect line must have the same capacity as the work line. Unfortunately, the protect line may be much longer than the work line and costly to implement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Both path protection and line protection in an optical ring are referred to below as ring protection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Communication nodes may also exchange communications with one another over links in an optical mesh. If a link in the optical mesh experiences a fault, the nodes re-route the affected communications through the optical mesh around the fault. Unfortunately, the mesh protection may be slower than ring protection.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Ring protection and mesh protection have not been effectively integrated into a hybrid protection system.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention helps solve the above problems by effectively integrating ring protection and mesh protection into a hybrid protection system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some examples of the invention include a communication system that comprises a. plurality of optical fibers, a plurality of Point of Presence (POP) nodes coupled to the optical fibers, and a plurality of switch nodes coupled to the optical fibers. The POP nodes are configured to exchange communications with external systems. The switch nodes are configured to exchange the communications with the POP nodes and to exchange the communications with one another. In the event of a fault, the POP nodes and the switch nodes are configured to implement ring protection for the communications between the POP nodes and the switch nodes and to implement mesh protection for the communications between the switch nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Some examples of the invention include a communication system that comprises a plurality of optical fibers, a plurality of two degree nodes coupled to the optical fibers, and a plurality higher degree nodes coupled to the optical fibers. The two degree nodes and the higher degree nodes are configured to exchange communications. In the event of a fault, the two degree nodes and higher degree nodes are configured to implement ring protection for the communications with the two degree nodes and to implement mesh protection for the communications between the higher degree nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some examples of the invention include a communication system that comprises a plurality of optical fibers and a plurality of nodes coupled to the optical fibers. The nodes are configured to exchange communications, and in the event of a fault, the nodes are configured to implement ring protection for a first set of the communications and to implement mesh protection for a second set of the communications. A communication system customer selects the first set of the communications for the ring protection and selects the second set of the communications for the mesh protection.</p>

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Prior Communication Systemsâ€”<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref></p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A brief discussion of a prior communication system is first provided to facilitate a better understanding of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates communication system <b>100</b> in an example of the prior art. Communication system <b>100</b> includes switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b>, Point-of-Presence (POP) nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b>, optical rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b>, and Digital Cross-Connect (DCS) <b>130</b>. Switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>104</b> and POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>116</b> are connected to optical ring <b>131</b>. Switch nodes <b>105</b>-<b>108</b> and POP-nodes <b>117</b>-<b>122</b> are connected to optical ring <b>132</b>. Optical ring <b>131</b> is coupled to optical ring <b>132</b> by DCS <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Optical rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b> are comprised of optical fibers where rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b> could each use one or more optical wavelengths within the optical fibers. POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> could each comprise a Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) Add/Drop Multiplexer (ADM) that is coupled to optical rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b>. Switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b> could each comprise a SONET ADM that is coupled to optical rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b> and a class <b>4</b> telephone switching system that is coupled to the SONET ADM.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> exchange communications with systems that are external to communication system <b>100</b>. POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> exchange these communications with switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b>. In some examples, communication system <b>100</b> is a long distance telephone network, and POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> exchange the communications with local telephone networks and business enterprise networks. Thus, POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> provide access to communication network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> are individually homed to switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b>. Homing means that a particular POP node exchanges its traffic with a particular home switch node. To home POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> to switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b>, bidirectional connections are established between individual POP nodes and individual home switch nodes through optical rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this example, path protection is used, but line protection could be used as an <b>10</b> alternative. A work path and a protect path are established between each POP node and home switch node around opposite sides-of the optical ring. Thus, each POP node is homed to a switch node on the same optical ring by a geographically diverse work path and protect path. POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b> are homed to switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b> as indicated in the following table.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b> exchange communications with POP nodes <b>111</b>-<b>122</b>, and exchange these communications with one another. If communication system <b>100</b> is a long distance telephone network, an originating switch node that receives a call into network <b>100</b> selects the terminating switch node that will transfer the call from network <b>100</b>. The originating switch node exchanges call communications with the terminating switch node. The originating and terminating switch nodes exchange these call communications with their respective POP nodes to complete the call path through network <b>100</b>. Thus, switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b> route user communications through communication network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To perform the routing, each switch node has a bidirectional connection to other switch nodes for-switch-to-switch communications. Between two switch nodes, the connection includes a geographically diverse work path and protect path around opposite sides of the optical rings. These connections between switch nodes <b>101</b>-<b>108</b> are established through DCS <b>130</b> and optical rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Consider a telephone call where a caller will exchange communications with POP node <b>115</b>, and the called party will exchange communications with POP node <b>120</b>. During call set-up, the originating switch node <b>104</b> processes the called number to select terminating switch node <b>107</b>. During the call, POP node <b>115</b> exchanges communications between the caller and switch node <b>104</b>. POP node <b>120</b> exchanges the communications between the called party and switch node <b>107</b>. Switch node <b>104</b> exchanges the communications with switch node <b>107</b>. Without a fault, the work paths are used for the call.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If an optical ring experiences a fault, the nodes transfer the affected communications from the work path to the protect path. Thus, the communications are re-routed around the other side of the faulty optical ring. For example, if optical ring <b>131</b> is cut between switch node <b>101</b> and POP node <b>111</b> as indicated by the X mark on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, then nodes <b>101</b> and <b>111</b> re-route their communications over the protect path in the opposite direction around optical ring <b>131</b>. Likewise during the fault, switch nodes <b>101</b> and <b>105</b> may re-route their communications over their protect path in the opposite direction around optical ring <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Note that communication system <b>100</b> uses ring protection for both POP-to-switch communications and switch-to-switch communications.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates communication system <b>200</b> in another example of the prior art. Communication system <b>200</b> could be similar to communication system <b>100</b> in various aspects, but communication system <b>200</b> has a different ring architecture from communication system <b>100</b>. Communication system <b>200</b> includes switch nodes <b>201</b>-<b>204</b>, POP nodes <b>211</b>-<b>230</b>, and optical rings <b>231</b>-<b>232</b>. Switch nodes <b>201</b>-<b>204</b> and POP nodes <b>211</b>-<b>224</b> are connected to optical ring <b>231</b>. Switch nodes <b>201</b>-<b>204</b> and POP nodes <b>225</b>-<b>230</b> are connected to optical ring <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Communication system <b>200</b> is an example of stacked rings. Optical rings <b>231</b>-<b>232</b> are stacked because optical ring <b>231</b> cannot effectively handle additional POP nodes <b>225</b>-<b>230</b>, so another optical ring <b>232</b> is added to handle additional POP nodes <b>225</b>-<b>230</b>. All switch nodes <b>201</b>-<b>204</b> are connected to both stacked rings <b>231</b>-<b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">POP nodes <b>211</b>-<b>230</b> are individually homed to switch nodes <b>201</b>-<b>208</b> over bidirectional connections that are established between individual POP nodes and individual home switch nodes through optical rings <b>231</b>-<b>232</b>. Between each POP node and home switch node, a work path and a protect path are established around opposite sides of the optical ring. POP nodes <b>211</b>-<b>230</b> are homed to switch nodes <b>201</b>-<b>204</b> as indicated in the following table.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this example, path protection is used, but line protection could be used as an alternative. Each switch node has a bidirectional connection to every other switch node for switch-to-switch communications. Between two switch nodes, the connection includes a geographically diverse work path and protect path around opposite sides of the optical rings. The connections between switch nodes <b>201</b>-<b>204</b> are established through optical rings <b>231</b>-<b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Consider a telephone call where a caller will exchange communications with POP node <b>211</b>, and the called party will exchange communications with POP node <b>228</b>. During call set-up, the originating switch node <b>201</b> processes the called number to select terminating switch node.<b>203</b>. During the call, POP node <b>211</b> exchanges communications between the caller and switch node <b>201</b>. POP node <b>228</b> exchanges the communications between the called party and switch node <b>203</b>. Switch node <b>201</b> exchanges the communications with switch node <b>203</b>. Without a fault, the work paths are used for the call.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If an optical ring experiences a fault, then the nodes transfer the affected communications from the work path to the protect path. Thus, the communications are re-routed around the other side of the faulty optical ring. For example, if optical rings <b>231</b>-<b>232</b> are cut between switch node <b>203</b> and POP nodes <b>218</b> and <b>228</b> as indicated by the X marks on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, then nodes <b>203</b> and <b>228</b> re-route their communications over the protect path in the opposite direction around optical ring <b>232</b>. Likewise during the fault, switch nodes <b>201</b> and <b>205</b> re-route their communications over their protect path in the opposite direction around optical ring <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Path-based ring protection requires end-to-end protect paths between POP nodes and switch nodes and between switch nodes and switch nodes. Unfortunately, restoration by re-routing over a protect path around the opposite side of a ring can be inefficient and expensive. If two neighboring switch nodes on a ring exchange a high traffic volume over their short work path, then an equally high capacity protect path, which is typically much longer, must be established all the way around the other side of the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, consider an optical ring that traverses the eastern United States along the following routeâ€”New Yorkâ€”Washington DCâ€”Atlantaâ€”Dallasâ€”Chicagoâ€”New York. If a network customer requires a large amount of bandwidth between their sites in Washington DC and New York, the ring must be upgraded to provide a high-capacity work path between Washington DC and New York. Unfortunately, the ring must also be upgraded to provide a high-capacity protect path over the longer route through Atlanta, Dallas, and Chicago.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates communication system <b>300</b> in an example of the invention. Communication system <b>300</b> includes switch nodes <b>301</b>-<b>308</b>, POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b>, cross-connect (X-CON on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3-4</figref>) <b>330</b>, optical rings <b>331</b>-<b>332</b>, and optical link <b>333</b>. Switch nodes <b>301</b>-<b>304</b> and POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>316</b> are connected to optical ring <b>331</b>. Switch nodes <b>305</b>-<b>308</b> and POP nodes-<b>317</b>-<b>322</b> are connected to optical ring <b>332</b>. Optical ring <b>331</b> is coupled to optical ring <b>332</b> by cross-connect <b>330</b> and by optical link <b>333</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Cross-connect <b>330</b> could be optical or electrical. Optical rings <b>331</b>-<b>332</b> are comprised of optical fibers where rings <b>331</b>-<b>332</b> could each use one or more optical wavelengths within the optical fibers. POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> could each comprise a SONET ADM that is coupled to optical rings <b>331</b>-<b>332</b>. Switch nodes <b>301</b>-<b>308</b> could each comprise a SONET ADM and cross-connect that is coupled to optical rings <b>131</b>-<b>132</b> and a switching system that is coupled to the SONET ADM and cross-connect. The switching system could be a class <b>4</b> switch, class <b>5</b> switch, internet protocol router, asynchronous transfer mode switch, frame relay switch, multi-protocol label switch, or some other type of switching system.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> exchange communications with systems that are external to communication system <b>300</b>. POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> exchange these communications with switch nodes <b>301</b>-<b>308</b>. In some examples, communication system <b>300</b> is a long-distance telephone network, and POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> exchange the communications with local telephone networks and business enterprise networks. Thus, POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> provide access to communication network <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> are individually homed to switch nodes <b>301</b>-<b>308</b>. To home POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> to switch nodes <b>301</b>-<b>308</b>, bidirectional connections are established between individual POP nodes and individual home switch nodes through optical rings <b>331</b>-<b>332</b>. Path protection is used in this example, so a work path and a protect path are established between each POP node and home switch node around opposite sides of the optical ring. Thus, each POP node is homed to a switch node on the same optical ring by physically or geographically diverse work and protect paths. Alternatively, line protection could be used instead of path protectionâ€”where both path and line protection are referred to as ring protection. POP nodes <b>311</b>-<b>322</b> are homed to switch nodes <b>301</b>-<b>308</b> as indicated in the following table.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each switch node has a bidirectional connection to other switch nodes for switch-to-switch communications. The connections are established through cross-connects <b>330</b> and <b>441</b>-<b>448</b> over their respective links. Note that geographically diverse work and protect paths around opposite sides of the optical rings are not required to interconnect switch nodes. In the event of a fault, cross-connects <b>330</b> and <b>441</b>-<b>448</b> re-route switch-to-switch traffic through the mesh links around the fault.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, consider a telephone call where a caller will exchange communications with POP node <b>316</b>, and the called party will exchange communications with POP node <b>320</b>. During call set-up, originating switch node <b>301</b> processes the called number to select terminating switch node <b>307</b>. During the call, POP node <b>316</b> exchanges communications between the caller and switch node <b>301</b>. POP node <b>320</b> exchanges the communications between the called party and switch node <b>307</b>. Switch node <b>301</b> exchanges the communications with switch node <b>307</b>. Without a fault, the work paths are used for the call communications between POP node <b>316</b> and switch node <b>301</b> and between POP node <b>320</b> and switch node <b>307</b>. The cross-connect links are used for the call communications between switch node <b>301</b> and switch node <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If optical ring <b>331</b> experiences a fault between POP node <b>316</b> and switch node <b>301</b> as indicated by the X mark on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, then nodes <b>301</b> and <b>316</b> transfer their communications from their work path to their protect path. Thus, the POP-to-switch communications use ring protection to re-route communications around the other side of faulty optical ring <b>331</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Unlike some prior art systems, switch-to-switch communications are not re-routed over a protect path in the opposite direction on ring <b>33</b> <b>1</b>. As indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by X marks, the fault on ring <b>331</b> disrupts communications between cross-connect <b>441</b> and cross-connect <b>448</b>, between cross-connect <b>330</b> and cross-connect <b>448</b>, and between cross-connect <b>330</b> and cross-connect <b>444</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the call, switch <b>401</b> of node <b>301</b> exchanges communications with switch <b>407</b> of node <b>307</b>. Because of the mesh, cross-connect <b>441</b> and cross-connect <b>447</b> have multiple links that may be used to re-route these switch-to-switch communications around the fault between switches <b>401</b> and <b>407</b>. One-half of the affected communications could be re-routed by cross-connect <b>441</b> and <b>447</b> through cross-connect <b>330</b>. The other half of the affected communications could be re-routed by cross-connect <b>441</b> and <b>447</b> through cross-connect <b>442</b>-<b>446</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, in the event of a fault, POP-to-switch communications affected by the fault are re-routed using ring protection. Switch-to-switch communications that are affected by the fault are re-routed using mesh protection. Ring protection and mesh protection may be wavelength based or sub-wavelength based. The hybrid ring/mesh protection described above is fully applicable to stacked rings as well.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Advantageously, mesh protection between switch nodes does not require inefficient and lengthy protect paths around the other side of a ring because mesh protection may be distributed among multiple shorter links that can be shared. If a particular work path requires a large capacity upgrade, then the mesh protection for the work path may be implemented over multiple links without the need to build a large and lengthy protect path.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Mesh protection could be based on many factors. Links that form a protect connection with latency that is low enough to avoid echo cancellation may be preferred. If the faulty link has a particular class-of-service, then links that form a protect connection that maintains the class-of-service may be preferred. Links that form a protect connection with latency that is low enough to maintain a service level agreement may be preferred. Links that form a protect connection with latency that is low enough to support the requirements a specific protocol being used may be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Hybrid ring/mesh protection could be selected by the customer based on need and cost. Ring protection has the fastest restoration but costs the more. Mesh protection could be broken into two classesâ€”planned and best effort. Planned mesh protection uses links that are pre-selected for the given fault condition to build the protect connection. Planned mesh protection is relatively fast and is cheaper than ring protection. Best effort mesh protection assesses the fault condition after the fault-to select the best available links to build the protect connection. Best-effort mesh protection offers the slowest and cheapest restoration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, a customer may desire expensive ring protection for a critical connection because of better restoration speed. The customer may desire planned mesh protection for an important connection because the restoration is fast enough, but the higher cost of ring protection is avoided. The customer may desire best-effort mesh protection for less important connections because the restoration is adequate and saves more money.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Two degree nodes <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>509</b>, <b>514</b>, and <b>516</b> are connected to an optical ring. Higher degree nodes <b>503</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>505</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>511</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>513</b>, and <b>515</b> are connected to an optical mesh and possibly to the optical ring. The two degree nodes are connected to the other nodes over the optical rings with work and protect paths or lines. Thus, the higher degree nodes are connected to the two degree nodes over these work and protect paths or lines. The higher degree nodes are connected to the other higher degree nodes over the optical mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the event of a fault, nodes communicating over the optical ring transfer their affected communications over the protect path or line in the optical ring. Nodes communicating over the optical mesh re-route their affected communications around the fault, through the mesh. Thus, communications with two degree nodes are ring protected. Communications between higher degree nodes and not with two degree nodes are mesh protected.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the first example given above, the POP nodes were two degree nodes and the switch nodes were three degree nodes. Thus, the POP-to-switch communications were ring protected and the switch-to-switch communications were mesh protected.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a variation to this example, select communications between three and four degree nodes could be ring protected instead of mesh protected. In this way, the various classes of protection could be selected by the customer for implementation by communication system <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, in the event of a fault, nodes <b>501</b>-<b>516</b> could implement ring protection for a first set of communications and implement mesh protection for a second set of communications. The customer of the communication system could select the first set of the communications for the ring protection and select the second set of the communications for the mesh protection. Typically, the ring protection would be more expensive than the mesh protection. In addition, the mesh protection may use links pre-planned for the fault for a first portion of the second set of communications and use links selected after the fault for a second portion of the second set of communications. Typically, the mesh protection using the pre-planned links is more expensive than the mesh protection using links selected after the fault.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Mesh protection could also use a hierarchy approach where a pre-planned protection scheme for the specific fault condition is implemented, first (static mesh protection), but if there is no pre-planned protection scheme for the specific fault condition, then an algorithm can be used to dynamically assess the fault to devise and implement a protection scheme (dynamic mesh protection).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Hybrid ring mesh protection could also use a hierarchy where ring protection is used first. If ring protection is not available, then static mesh protection is used. If static mesh protection is not available, then dynamic mesh protection is used.</p>
