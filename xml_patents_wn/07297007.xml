<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to a conductive terminal and, more particularly, to a conductive terminal used in an electrical connector which can transit signals between an electronic component and a circuit board via a solder ball connected with the circuit board.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Referring to FIG. 1 to 3, as disclosed in T.W. patent application No. 087216147, publication No. 392975, an electrical connector <b>1</b> is a zero insertion force (“ZIF”) electrical connector for electrically interconnecting a central processing unit (“CPU”) and a mainboard used in computer device. The electrical connector <b>1</b> comprises an insulative housing <b>10</b> and a plurality of conductive terminals <b>2</b>. Each of the conductive terminals <b>2</b> electrically connects with the circuit board <b>30</b> through surface mounting technology (“SMT”) by pre-setting a solder ball <b>23</b> onto an end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The insulative housing <b>10</b> of the electrical connector <b>1</b> has a mounting surface <b>12</b> on the bottom surface thereof which is positioned proximate to the circuit board <b>30</b> and a receiving surface <b>11</b> on the top surface thereof for supporting the electronic component. The insulative housing <b>10</b> also defines a plurality of through holes <b>13</b> extending between the mounting surface <b>12</b> and the receiving surface <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each of the conductive terminals <b>2</b> respectively received in the corresponding through holes <b>13</b> forms a contact portion <b>20</b> extending toward the receiving surface <b>11</b> and an end portion <b>21</b> opposite extending to the mounting surface <b>12</b>. The end portion <b>21</b> has a bottom surface <b>22</b> for soldering with the corresponding solder ball <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To improve the success rate of pre-setting the solder ball <b>23</b> onto the end portion <b>21</b> of the conductive terminals <b>2</b>, the end portion <b>21</b> forms a disk-shape plane approximately 90 degrees bending to the contact portion <b>20</b> so that the end portion <b>21</b> and the mounting surface <b>12</b> of the insulative housing <b>10</b> are approximately located in the same plane. The plane disk-shape end portion <b>21</b> provides a larger area of pre-setting the solder ball <b>23</b> so as to steadily pre-set the solder ball <b>23</b>. In addition, a plurality of protrusions <b>25</b> is integrity extending from the side of the end portion <b>21</b> for preventing the solder ball <b>23</b> dropping from the bottom surface <b>22</b> of the end portion <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To applying the SMT of pre-setting the solder ball <b>23</b>, one end of the conductive terminal <b>2</b> must have a structure of easily locating and connecting the solder ball <b>23</b>. The above method is only one of the resolving schemes with which the end portion of the conductive terminal <b>2</b> has different structures to locate and connect the solder ball <b>23</b>. The present invention provides an improved conductive terminal to locate and connect the solder ball <b>23</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a conductive terminal that easily locates a solder ball and an electrical connector using the conductive terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide a conductive terminal enhancing steadiness of soldering with a solder ball.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The conductive terminals of the present invention are received in a plurality of terminal channels of an insulative housing of the electrical connector which can transmit signal between an electronic component and a circuit board. The conductive terminal has a first wall, a second wall connecting with the first wall in a certain angle and a third wall connecting with the second wall in a certain angle and opposite to the first wall. The conductive terminal forms a contact portion electrically connecting with the electronic component and a mounting portion electrically connecting with the circuit board via the solder ball. The mounting portion comprises a horizontal portion extending and bending from one end of the first wall toward the third wall, and an vertical portion on the third wall and corresponding to the horizontal portion in a certain angle. The horizontal portion and the vertical portion adhere to the solder ball in two different directions so as to steadily locate the solder ball.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A gap is defined between the vertical portion and a side face of the horizontal portion near the vertical portion. When the solder ball melts, tin flows into the gap so as to enhance steadiness of soldering between the solder ball and the mounting portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While the invention may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there is shown in the drawings, and herein will be described in detail, a specific embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to that as illustrated and described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a conductive terminal <b>4</b> of the present invention used in an electrical connector is similar with the prior art and connects between an electronic component (not shown) and a circuit board (not shown). The conductive terminal <b>4</b> pre-sets a solder ball <b>6</b> onto an end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The electrical connector comprises an insulative housing <b>5</b> and a plurality of conductive terminals <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The insulative housing <b>5</b> has a mounting surface <b>51</b> which is positioned proximate to the circuit board (such as motherboard of a computer) and a receiving surface <b>52</b> for supporting the electronic component (such as central processing unit, CPU). The insulative housing <b>5</b> defines a plurality of terminal channels <b>53</b> extending through the mounting surface <b>51</b> and the receiving surface <b>52</b>. To easily illuminate, it is drawn in the FIGS. that the insulative housing <b>5</b> has a single terminal channel <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each conductive terminal <b>4</b> is respectively received in the corresponding terminal channels <b>53</b>. The conductive terminal <b>4</b> has a first wall <b>41</b>, a second wall <b>42</b> connecting with one side of the first wall <b>41</b> in an approximately 90 degrees angle and a third wall <b>43</b> connecting with the other side of the second wall <b>42</b> in an approximately 90 degrees angle and opposite to the first wall <b>41</b> in some distance. The connecting corner of the first wall <b>41</b> and the second wall <b>42</b> defines a plurality of hollows <b>44</b> so as to make the connecting corner of the first wall <b>41</b> and the second wall <b>42</b> have lower intensity and the first wall <b>41</b> easily bend along the hollows <b>44</b>. Similarly, the connecting corner of the third wall <b>43</b> and the second wall <b>42</b> defines a plurality of hollows <b>44</b> so as to make the third wall <b>43</b> easily bend along the hollows <b>44</b> to the second wall <b>42</b>. When the conductive terminal <b>4</b> is respectively received in the corresponding terminal channel <b>53</b>, one end of the conductive terminal <b>4</b> adjacent to the mounting surface <b>51</b> forms a mounting portion <b>401</b> and the opposite end to the mounting portion <b>401</b> of the conductive terminal <b>4</b> adjacent to the receiving surface <b>52</b> forms a contact portion <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The mounting portion <b>401</b> comprises a horizontal portion <b>45</b> extending and bending in an approximately 90 degrees from one end of the first wall <b>41</b> adjacent to the mounting surface <b>51</b> toward the third wall <b>43</b>, and an vertical portion <b>46</b> extending from the third wall <b>43</b> and corresponding to the horizontal portion <b>45</b> in an approximately 90 degrees angle. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the horizontal portion <b>45</b> and the mounting surface <b>51</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b> are approximately in a same plane. And the vertical portion <b>46</b> is extending out of the mounting surface <b>51</b> and forms a L-shaped structure with the horizontal portion <b>45</b> to locate the solder ball <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The contact portion <b>402</b> comprises a first spring arm <b>47</b> formed on one side of the first wall <b>41</b> adjacent to the receiving surface <b>52</b> and a second spring arm <b>48</b> formed on one side of the second wall <b>42</b> adjacent to the receiving surface <b>52</b>. A free end of the first spring arm <b>47</b> and a free end of the second spring arm <b>48</b> are adjacent to form a spring receiving structure to provide an insert arm of an electrical component (not shown) inserting. Because the contact portion <b>402</b> is not the point of novelty of the present invention and its principle of electrically connecting is similar with a corresponding structure of the conductive terminal of the ZIF electrical connector (not shown), here it is not illuminated in detail. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in assembly, the conductive terminal <b>4</b> can be inserted into the corresponding terminal channels <b>53</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b> from the mounting surface <b>51</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and the conductive terminal <b>4</b> can also be inserted into the corresponding terminal channels <b>53</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b> from the receiving surface <b>52</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). When the conductive terminal <b>4</b> is inserted into the corresponding terminal channels <b>53</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b> from the mounting surface <b>51</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b>, a user can hold the vertical portion <b>46</b> of the mounting portion <b>401</b> of the conductive terminal <b>4</b> during insertion. Contrary, when the conductive terminal <b>4</b> is inserted into the corresponding terminal channels <b>53</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b> from the receiving surface <b>52</b> of the insulative housing <b>5</b>, one end of the second wall <b>42</b> forms a handle <b>49</b> corresponding to the first spring arm <b>47</b> and the second spring arm <b>48</b>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the mounting portion <b>401</b> of the conductive terminal <b>4</b> locates the solder ball <b>6</b> by its horizontal portion <b>45</b> and vertical portion <b>46</b>. When the solder ball <b>6</b> contacts the surface of the horizontal portion <b>45</b>, the vertical portion <b>46</b> prevents the solder ball <b>6</b> moving along the extending direction of the horizontal portion <b>45</b> because the vertical portion <b>46</b> is in an approximately 90 degrees and forms a L-shaped structure with the horizontal portion <b>45</b>. Therefore, when the solder ball <b>6</b> is put into the L-shape space defined by the horizontal portion <b>45</b> and the vertical portion <b>46</b>, the solder ball <b>6</b> respectively connects the horizontal portion <b>45</b> and the vertical portion <b>46</b>, and locates by them in two different directions. So the solder ball <b>6</b> need not accurately align the surface of the horizontal portion <b>45</b> and easily to locate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, to improve veracity of the solder ball <b>6</b> aligning, the horizontal portion <b>45</b> defines a recess <b>451</b>. When the solder ball <b>6</b> connects with the horizontal portion <b>45</b>, the solder ball <b>6</b> is received in the recess <b>451</b> of the horizontal portion <b>45</b> and enhances steadiness of locating the solder ball <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a gap <b>452</b> is defined between the vertical portion <b>46</b> and a side face of the horizontal portion <b>45</b> near the vertical portion <b>46</b>. When the solder ball <b>6</b> melts, tin flows into the gap <b>452</b> so that the solder ball <b>6</b> not only can respectively solder with the surfaces of the horizontal portion <b>45</b> and the vertical portion <b>46</b> in two different directions but also some tin of the solder ball <b>6</b> fasten in the gap <b>452</b> by embedding so as to enhance steadiness of soldering between the solder ball <b>6</b> and the mounting portion <b>401</b> of the conductive terminal <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The conductive terminal <b>4</b> has the first wall <b>41</b>, the second wall <b>42</b> and the third wall <b>43</b>. The conductive terminal <b>4</b> enhances steadiness of locating the solder ball <b>6</b> by the L-shape space defined by the horizontal portion <b>45</b> extending from the first wall <b>41</b> and the vertical portion <b>46</b> extending from the third wall <b>43</b>. The gap <b>452</b> is defined between the vertical portion <b>46</b> and a side face of the horizontal portion <b>45</b> near the vertical portion <b>46</b> to provide tin of the melting solder ball <b>6</b> flows therein and enhance steadiness of soldering with the solder ball <b>6</b>.</p>
