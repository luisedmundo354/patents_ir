<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Japanese Application(s) No(s). P2003-365853 filed Oct. 27, 2003, which application(s) is/are incorporated herein by reference to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a battery pack which has both a primary battery and a secondary battery such as a lithium ion battery or the like and which enables the secondary battery to be charged by the primary battery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Arts</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Secondary batteries are widely used in portable electronic apparatuses. Since a lithium ion battery is weak against an overcharge or an overdischarge, in general, it has a construction of a battery pack in which a battery cell and a protecting circuit are integrated. The protecting circuit has three functions of protection against the overcharge, the overdischarge, and an overcurrent. Those protecting functions will be simply explained hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The overcharge protecting function will now be described. When the lithium ion battery is charged, a battery voltage continues to rise even after exceeding a full charge state. When the battery enters such an overcharge state, a possibility that the battery enters a dangerous state occurs. Therefore, it is necessary to charge the battery at a constant current and a constant voltage and by a charge control voltage that is equal to or less than a rated value (for example, 4.2 V) of the battery. However, there is a risk of occurrence of the overcharge due to a failure of a charger or use of a charger for a different kind of battery. When the battery is overcharged and the battery voltage is equal to a certain value or more, the protecting circuit turns off a charge control FET, thereby shutting off a charge current. Such a function is the overcharge protecting function.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The overdischarge protecting function will now be described. When the battery is discharged to a rated discharge terminating voltage or less and enters the overdischarge state where the battery voltage is equal to, for example, 2 to 1.5 V or less, there is a case where the battery fails. When the battery is discharged and the battery voltage is equal to a certain voltage value or less, the protecting circuit turns off a discharge control FET, thereby shutting off a discharge current. Such a function is the overdischarge protecting function.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The overcurrent protecting function will now be described. When (+) and (−) terminals of the battery are short-circuited, a large current flows, so that there is a risk of abnormal heat generation. When a discharge current of a certain value or more flows, the protecting circuit turns off the discharge control FET, thereby shutting off the discharge current. Such a function is the overcurrent protecting function.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A conventional secondary battery pack is constructed only by a secondary battery and it is necessary to charge it by using a dedicated charger from a power source for household use at home or the like. Therefore, when a residual capacity of the battery is extinguished at a place where the user has gone to, there is such inconvenience that portable electronic apparatuses such as cellular phone, PDA (Personal Digital Assistants), digital camera, camcoder (a general abbreviated name of “camera and recorder”, video camera+recorder), and the like cannot be used.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As one of methods of solving such a problem, in cellular phones, a charging apparatus comprising only a primary battery which can be connected to a main body has been put into practical use. However, there is such a problem that the user has to separately carry a charging pack. To solve such a problem, a battery pack in which both a primary battery and a secondary battery are integrated is used and when a voltage of the secondary battery drops, the secondary battery is charged by the primary battery has been disclosed in JP-A-2000-324703.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the battery pack disclosed in JP-A-2000-324703, a comparator for comparing a voltage of the primary battery with that of the secondary battery is provided and when the voltage of the primary battery is larger than that of the secondary battery, the secondary battery is charged by the voltage of the primary battery through a regulator.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the battery pack disclosed in JP-A-2000-324703, although there is a disclosure that the battery is charged by an external charger, the battery pack does not have a function for automatically switching the primary battery as a charging power source and the external charger and a voltage from the external charger is not controlled. Further, when the battery is charged by the primary battery, the voltage of the primary battery is controlled by the regulator. If the voltage is controlled by the regulator, efficiency is low and a large electric power is wastefully consumed. Further, since the regulator is not small, a circuit cannot be miniaturized by the method of controlling by the regulator,</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a battery pack in which a charge from an external charger and a charge by a primary battery are automatically switched.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the invention is to provide a battery pack in which if a DC/DC converter is used instead of a regulator when a voltage of a primary battery is controlled, efficiency can be improved and miniaturization of a size and reduction of costs can be further realized.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To accomplish the above objects, according to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a battery pack having a secondary battery, comprising: a holding unit for detachably holding a primary battery; a switch for switching a voltage of the primary battery and a voltage at an external terminal; a voltage converter to which either the primary battery voltage or the external terminal voltage selected by the switch is inputted and which supplies a stabilized output voltage to a positive polarity of the secondary battery; and control means for controlling the switch so as to select the external terminal voltage in a normal state and, when the primary battery is attached, select the primary battery voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a battery pack having a secondary battery, comprising: a holding unit for detachably holding a primary battery; a switch for switching a voltage of the primary battery and a voltage at an external terminal; a voltage converter to which either the primary battery voltage or the external terminal voltage selected by the switch is inputted and which supplies a stabilized output voltage to a positive polarity of the secondary battery; and control means for controlling the switch so as to select the primary battery voltage in a normal state and, when the external terminal voltage is supplied, select the external terminal voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the invention, even at a place where there is no power source for household use in the case where the user has gone or the like, if he has the primary battery, he can charge the secondary battery merely by attaching the primary battery.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention, by controlling the switch by the control means, the charge by the external terminal voltage from an external charger and the charge by the primary battery voltage can be automatically switched.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the invention, by using a DC/DC converter as a charging voltage converter for controlling the voltage of the primary battery, the efficiency can be improved and the miniaturization and the reduction in costs can be realized as compared with the case of using the regulator.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the invention, by providing the switch for switching the charging power sources, the state where a current flows reversely from the charger side to the primary battery when the primary battery is attached can be prevented and the state where the current from the charger and the current from the primary battery side flow simultaneously can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the primary battery holder <b>2</b> has a concave portion for enclosing the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>and an upper portion of the holder <b>2</b> is covered with a lid <b>2</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> again. The secondary battery pack <b>1</b> has: a secondary battery <b>11</b>; a protecting circuit (IC) <b>12</b>; FETs <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>; parasitic diodes <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>; a DC/DC converter <b>17</b>; and a charge change-over switch <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Any of a lithium ion battery, a lithium polymer battery, a nickel hydrogen battery, a nickel-cadmium (Ni—Cd) battery, a lithium metal battery, and the like can be used as a secondary battery <b>11</b>. In the case of the lithium ion battery, for example, it is constructed as a rectangular battery and the whole secondary battery <b>11</b> is covered by a battery can of iron. In the case of the lithium polymer battery, it is sealed by a laminated film of aluminum. The secondary battery can be also replaced with a secondary battery of a kind which will be developed in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The DC/DC converter <b>17</b> is a circuit for converting an input voltage from the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> into a stabilized DC voltage. Any of various kinds of converters can be used as a DC/DC converter <b>17</b>. That is, one of the following constructions can be used: a charger pump system using a capacitor and a switching element; a step-up converter (step-down converter) using a diode, an inductor, a capacitor, and a switching element; a switching regulator using a transformer and a switching element; and a piezoelectric inverter using a piezoelectric transformer. Efficiency of those DC/DC converters are better than that of a series regulator using a bipolar transistor device. Since a very small device of about 4 mm square has already been developed as a voltage converter of the charger pump system or a switching regulator, the DC/DC converter <b>17</b> can be relatively easily built in the secondary battery pack <b>1</b> together with the protecting circuit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A positive polarity of the secondary battery <b>11</b> is connected to an external terminal <b>21</b>,and a negative polarity is connected to an external terminal <b>22</b> through the FET <b>13</b> as a switch for a discharge current and the FET <b>14</b> as a switch for a charge current. A voltage of the secondary battery <b>11</b> which is outputted across the external terminals <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is set to, for example, about 2.5 to 4.3 V.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The FETs <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are, for example, FETs of the n-channel type. The parasitic diodes <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are connected in parallel with the FETs <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. The FETs <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are controlled by a discharge control signal and a charge control signal from the protecting circuit <b>12</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The protecting circuit <b>12</b> has a general circuit construction. The FETs <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are controlled by the protecting circuit <b>12</b> and the overcharge protection, the overdischarge protection, and the overcurrent protection are performed. If the battery is in a normal state where the battery voltage is within a set voltage range, both of the discharge control signal and the charge control signal are set to “1” (this means a logical level) and the FETs <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are turned on. Therefore, the discharge from the secondary battery <b>11</b> to a load and the charge from the charger to the secondary battery <b>11</b> can be freely executed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the battery voltage is lower than the set voltage range, the discharge control signal is set to “0” (this means a logical level) and the FET <b>13</b> is turned off, thereby inhibiting the discharge current from flowing. After that, when the charger is connected, the battery is charged through the diode <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the battery voltage is higher than the set voltage range, the charge control signal is set to “0” and the FET <b>14</b> is turned off, thereby inhibiting the charge. The discharge to the load is performed through the diode <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, the external terminals <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are short-circuited, the overdischarge current flows and there is a possibility that the FET is broken. Therefore, when the discharge current reaches a predetermined current value, the discharge control signal is set to “0” and the FET <b>13</b> is turned off, thereby inhibiting the discharge current from flowing.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Reference numeral <b>23</b> denotes a charging terminal to which an external terminal voltage is supplied from an external charger, that is, an AC adapter (not shown). The AC adapter converts a household AC power source (100V) into, for example, 5V. If the charger is not connected, the charging terminal <b>23</b> is opened. However, a pull-down resistor (not shown) is connected to the charging terminal <b>23</b> so that the charging terminal <b>23</b> is set to 0V when the charger is not connected. The charging terminal <b>23</b> is connected to one input terminal (a) of the charge change-over switch <b>18</b>. An output terminal (c) of the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> is connected to an input terminal of the DC/DC converter <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the other input terminal (b) of the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> is connected to a cathode of a diode <b>19</b>. An anode of the diode <b>19</b> is connected to positive polarities of the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c</i>. Negative polarities of the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>are connected to the external terminal <b>22</b>. The diode <b>19</b> prevents the current from reversely flowing from the secondary battery side to the primary battery side. Since the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> is provided, it is possible to prevent the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>from being charged by the external terminal voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The charge change-over switch <b>18</b> is controlled by a detection signal from the detecting switch <b>4</b> as control means. The detecting switch <b>4</b> is turned on or off in accordance with whether or not the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>have been attached to the battery holder as mentioned above. Although an amplifier, a pulse generator, and the like are actually connected to the detecting switch <b>4</b>, they are omitted in the diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the normal state where the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>are not attached to the battery holder, the detecting switch <b>4</b> is turned off, the detection signal is set to, for example, “0” (this means “0” as a logic value), and the input terminal (a) and the output terminal (c) of the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> are connected. The voltage which is supplied from the external charger to the charging terminal <b>23</b> is inputted to the DC/DC converter <b>17</b>. The secondary battery <b>11</b> is charged by an output of a predetermined value of the DC/DC converter <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>are attached to the battery holder, the detecting switch <b>4</b> is turned on, the detection signal is set to, for example, “1” (this means “1” as a logic value), and the input terminal (b) and the output terminal (c) of the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> are connected through the diode <b>19</b>. The voltage which is supplied from the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>is inputted to the DC/DC converter <b>17</b>. The secondary battery <b>11</b> is charged by an output voltage of a predetermined value of the DC/DC converter <b>17</b>, for example, a charging voltage of 4.2V.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As mentioned above, both the voltage from the primary battery side and the voltage from the charger side are controlled by the DC/DC converter <b>17</b>. The DC/DC converter <b>17</b> has a step-up/down type construction in which when the charging voltage is lower than the set voltage value, the voltage is stepped up, and when the charging voltage is higher than the set voltage value, the voltage is stepped down. The secondary battery is charged by the voltage which was controlled to the rated charging voltage value. When the battery is charged, it is prevented by the DC/DC converter <b>17</b> from being charged by a voltage higher than the rated charging voltage value of the secondary battery <b>11</b>, for example, the lithium ion secondary battery.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the embodiment has been described above on the assumption that the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> is an electronic switch which is controlled by the detection signal, the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> can be realized by a mechanical switch. That is, the charge change-over switch <b>18</b> can be also constructed in such a manner that the input terminal (a) (on the side of the external charger) and the output terminal (c) are connected in the normal state and when the primary batteries <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c </i>are attached, the switch <b>18</b> is mechanically switched to the state where the input terminal (b) (on the side of the primary battery) and the output terminal (c) are connected.</p>
