<heading id="h-0004" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates to methods for stimulating oil and/or gas production through a plurality of perforations in a casing of a wellbore penetrating one or more subterranean formations. More particularly, the invention relates to methods of forming particulate packs in a plurality of perforations in a casing of a wellbore.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To produce hydrocarbons (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, etc.) from the earth, a wellbore can be drilled that penetrates one or more hydrocarbon-bearing strata or subterranean formations, also known as reservoir formations. As used herein, the “perforated interval” or “production interval” is the section of a wellbore that has been prepared for production by creating channels between the reservoir formation and the wellbore. In many cases, long reservoir sections will be perforated in several intervals, with short sections of unperforated casing between each interval to enable isolation devices, like packers, to be set for subsequent treatments or remedial operations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, after a wellbore has been drilled to a desired depth, completion operations can be performed, which is the assembly of downhole tubulars and equipment required to enable production from an oil or gas well. Completion operations can involve the insertion of casing into a wellbore, and thereafter the casing, if desired, can be cemented into place. To produce hydrocarbon from the subterranean formation, one or more perforations can be created that penetrate through the casing, through the cement, and into the production interval.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">At some point in the completion operation, a stimulation operation can be performed to enhance hydrocarbon production from the wellbore. Stimulation is a treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly conductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and generally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near-wellbore area. Thus, stimulation operations can include hydraulic fracturing, acidizing, fracture acidizing, or other suitable stimulation operations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">After the stimulation operation, the wellbore can be placed into production. Generally, the produced hydrocarbons flow from the reservoir, through the perforations of the production intervals with the wellbore and through the wellbore to the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Problems can result in stimulation operations where the wellbore penetrates multiple production intervals due to the variation of fracture gradients between these intervals. The most depleted of the production intervals typically have the lowest fracture gradients among the multiple production intervals. When a stimulation operation is simultaneously conducted on all of the production intervals, the treatment fluid can preferentially enter the most depleted intervals. Therefore, the stimulation operation often does not obtain the full benefit of the stimulation in those production intervals having relatively higher fracture gradients.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One method conventionally used to overcome problems encountered during the stimulation of a subterranean formation having multiple production intervals has been to use packers and/or bridge plugs to isolate the particular production interval before the stimulation operations. This can be problematic, however, due to the existence of open perforations in the wellbore and the potential sticking of these mechanical isolation devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another method conventionally used to overcome problems encountered during the stimulation of a subterranean formation having multiple production intervals has been to perform a remedial cementing operation prior to the stimulation operation to plug the open perforations in the wellbore. This hopefully prevents the undesired entry of the stimulation fluid into the most depleted intervals of the wellbore. After the pre-existing perforations of a depleted production interval have been plugged with cement, the particular production interval can later be re-perforated, isolated, and then stimulated. While these remedial cementing operations can plug the pre-existing perforations and thus reduce the entry of the stimulation fluid into undesired portions of the formation, remedial cementing operations are often complicated and time consuming. This can require multiple remedial cementing operations to ensure complete plugging of all the pre-existing perforations. In addition, remedial cementing operations can damage near wellbore areas of the subterranean formation and/or require further remedial operations to remove undesired cement damage from the near-wellbore area before the well can be placed back into production.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method of the invention provides packing perforated and stimulating intervals with a consolidating proppant that will resist fracturing and allow diversion of treatment fluids to newly perforated intervals. Packing proppant into existing perforations prior to remedial stimulation can be done in a variety of methods.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/004,441, filed on Dec. 3, 2004, having named inventors Loyd E. East, Jr., Travis W. Cavender, and David J. Attaway, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes a method of packing perforations by running pipe to the first interval from the bottom up and then circulating particulate and carrier fluid to achieve a particulate pack (i.e., simultaneously packing all the open perforations).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method of the invention advantageously provides a method of serially packing perforations by running pipe to the first interval from the top to bottom and then circulating particulate and carrier fluid to achieve a particulate pack (i.e., packing each level of open perforations separately). By isolating individual packing levels during a packing operation to serially pack all the perforations in the casing, the invention advantageously packs all perforations completely, thereby avoiding leaking into the wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method of the invention provides forming packs in a plurality of perforations in a casing of the wellbore, the method comprising the steps of: (a) forming a plug of a plugging particulate material in the bore of a casing, wherein the plug covers at least one perforation in the casing; (b) forming a pack of a first packing particulate material in at least one perforation in the casing located above the plug; (c) removing at least an upper portion of the plug to expose the at least one perforation in the casing that had been previously covered by at least the upper portion of the plug; and (d) forming a pack of a second packing particulate material in the at least one perforation exposed by removing at least the upper portion of the plug, wherein the second packing particulate material can be the same or different from the first packing particulate material.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The invention relates to methods for stimulating oil and/or gas production through a plurality of perforations in a casing of a wellbore penetrating one or more subterranean formations. More particularly, the invention relates to methods of forming particulate packs in a plurality of perforations in a casing of a wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While the methods of the invention are useful in a variety of applications, they can be particularly useful for stimulation operations in coal-bed-methane wells, high-permeability reservoirs suffering from near-wellbore compaction, or any well containing multiple perforated intervals that need stimulation. Among other applications, the methods of the invention allow for covering perforations in certain production intervals of a wellbore so that a desired production interval or intervals of the subterranean formation can be stimulated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The wellbore can be a primary wellbore or a branch wellbore that extends from a primary wellbore. Although the invention is described with respect to a wellbore shown in a vertical orientation, the methods according to the invention can be advantageously practiced in a section of a wellbore in any orientation, regardless of being substantially vertical, horizontal, or any orientation in between.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, illustrated is a cross-sectional side view of a vertical wellbore <b>100</b> that penetrates multiple production intervals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The wellbore is generally indicated at <b>100</b>. While wellbore <b>100</b> is depicted as a generally vertical wellbore, the methods of the invention can be performed in generally horizontal, inclined, or otherwise oriented portions of a wellbore. Accordingly, as used herein, the term “upper” as used in the phrases “upper portion of the plug,” “next upper portion,” “uppermost,” and the like means toward the “up-hole” side of the wellbore, including for applications where the wellbore is horizontal. As used herein, terms such as “first,” “second,” “third,” “next,” etc. are arbitrarily assigned and are merely intended to differentiate between two or more parts that are similar or corresponding in structure and/or function. It is to be understood that the words “first” and “second” serve no other purpose and are not part of the name or description of the following terms. Furthermore, it is to be understood that that the mere use of the term “first” does not require that there be any “second” similar or corresponding part, either as part of the same element or as part of another element. Similarly, the mere use of the word “second” does not require that there by any “third” or “next” similar or corresponding part, either as part of the same element or as part of another element, etc. In addition, wellbore <b>100</b> can include multilaterals, wherein wellbore <b>100</b> can be a primary wellbore having one or more branch wellbores extending therefrom, or wellbore <b>100</b> can be a branch wellbore extending from a primary wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Wellbore <b>100</b> penetrates subterranean formation <b>102</b> and has casing <b>104</b> disposed therein. Casing <b>104</b> may or may not be cemented in wellbore <b>100</b> by a cement sheath (not shown). While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts wellbore <b>100</b> as a cased wellbore, a portion of wellbore <b>100</b> can be left openhole.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Generally, subterranean formation <b>102</b> contains multiple production intervals, including uppermost or first production interval <b>106</b>, second production interval <b>108</b>, third production interval <b>110</b>, and fourth production interval <b>112</b>. The intervals of casing <b>104</b> adjacent to production intervals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are perforated by plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, such as perforations <b>142</b> of first production interval <b>106</b>, wherein plurality of perforations penetrate through casing <b>104</b>, through the cement sheath (if present), and into production intervals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. The intervals of casing <b>104</b> adjacent to production intervals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are first casing interval <b>107</b>, second casing interval <b>109</b>, third casing interval <b>111</b>, and fourth casing interval <b>113</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of the wellbore <b>100</b>, wherein a plug <b>136</b> has been formed in the wellbore <b>100</b> of the casing <b>104</b>, wherein the plug <b>136</b> covers at least one perforation in the casing <b>104</b>, such as perforations <b>144</b> of second production interval <b>108</b>. Although typically formed of sand, the plug <b>136</b> does not have to comprise sand. The plug <b>136</b> can be made up of any plugging particulate material of any material of a size capable of plugging the wellbore <b>100</b> while the exposed perforations above the plug <b>136</b> are packed with packing particulate material. For example, the plugging particulate material for the plug <b>136</b> can comprise sand or shell carbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The plug <b>136</b> is preferably formed by inserting a conduit <b>128</b> through the wellbore <b>100</b> and injecting plugging particulate material from the conduit <b>128</b> into the wellbore <b>100</b>. The conduit <b>128</b> is shown disposed in wellbore <b>100</b>. Conduit <b>128</b> can be coiled tubing, jointed pipe, or any other suitable conduit for the delivery of fluids during subterranean operations. Annulus <b>120</b> is defined as the space between casing <b>104</b> and conduit <b>128</b>. The setting of the plug <b>136</b> does not have to be precise because a conduit <b>100</b> can be run to the top of the plug <b>136</b> to determine the location of the plug <b>136</b> and confirm that only the perforations <b>142</b> of the uppermost production interval <b>106</b> are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the step of forming a plug <b>136</b> further comprises leaving at least one perforation exposed above the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, perforations <b>142</b> of first production interval <b>106</b> have been left exposed above the second production interval <b>108</b>. Alternatively, the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> can be removed by lowering a conduit <b>128</b> into the wellbore <b>100</b> and circulating a washing fluid through the conduit <b>128</b> to remove the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> could be the uppermost production interval <b>106</b> that is to be packed with packing particulate material, or, alternatively, could comprise only a portion of the uppermost production interval <b>106</b>. For example, the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> can include only some of the perforations <b>142</b> of the first production interval <b>106</b>, such that only some of the perforations are left exposed by the plug <b>136</b>. Also, the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> could be more than one production interval, such that the plugging particulate material of two or more production intervals are removed and packed with packing particular material at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of the wellbore, wherein a pack <b>124</b> of first packing particulate material is formed in the perforations <b>142</b> of the first production interval <b>106</b> in the casing <b>104</b> located above the plug <b>136</b>. To form the pack <b>124</b> of the first packing particulate material in the perforations <b>142</b> in the casing <b>104</b>, a first carrier fluid with the first packing particulate is introduced or pumped into the wellbore <b>100</b> under conditions to form the pack <b>124</b> of the first packing particulate material in at least one perforation <b>142</b> located above the plug <b>136</b> in the casing <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment of the methods of the invention, a carrier fluid with first packing particulate material can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> by pumping the carrier fluid down conduit <b>128</b>. In another embodiment, carrier fluid with first packing particulate material can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> by pumping the carrier fluid down annulus <b>120</b>. The carrier fluid and the packing particulate material will be discussed further below. The method of the invention advantageously does not require the conduit <b>128</b> that introduces the first packing particulate material and first carrier fluid to be positioned adjacent the target perforations to be packed during the packing process. Thus, the new method avoids having to have conduit <b>128</b> below all perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> of a casing <b>104</b> during the packing process, thus avoiding the chances for the conduit <b>128</b> becoming stuck in the wellbore <b>100</b> by the packing particulate material. The carrier fluid and packing particulate material can be pumped down the annulus <b>120</b> and squeezed into the exposed perforations <b>142</b> of the uppermost production interval <b>106</b> until a significant packing pressure is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The packing particulate material in the carrier fluid should be allowed to pack into plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, thereby forming particulate packs <b>124</b> in each of the plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>. Any suitable method can be used to introduce the carrier fluid into wellbore <b>100</b> so that particulate packs <b>124</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Generally, the carrier fluid can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> so that downhole pressures are sufficient for the carrier fluid to squeeze into production intervals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, but the downhole pressures are below the respective fracture gradients until plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> are effectively packed with particulates. Surface pumping pressures can be monitored to determine when particulate packs <b>124</b> have formed in each of the plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>. For example, when the surface pumping pressures of the carrier fluid increase above a pressure necessary for the downhole pressures to exceed the fracture gradients of production intervals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> without fracturing of such intervals, particulate packs <b>124</b> should have formed in each of the plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In certain embodiments, back pressure should be held on annulus <b>120</b>, among other things so that the carrier fluid enters plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and is squeezed into the matrix of subterranean formation <b>102</b>, so that carrier fluid is spread across plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, and so that carrier fluid maintains sufficient velocity for proppant suspension without exceeding fracturing pressures. In one embodiment, back pressure is applied on annulus <b>120</b> by limiting the return of the carrier fluid up through annulus <b>120</b> by utilizing a choke mechanism at the surface (not shown). As the carrier fluid enters plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and is squeezed into the matrix of subterranean formation <b>102</b>, the packing particulate material in the carrier fluid should bridge in plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and thus pack into plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> forming particulate packs <b>124</b> therein. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other suitable methods for squeezing the carrier fluid into the matrix of subterranean formation <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, illustrated is a cross-sectional side view of a perforation <b>142</b> after having a first packing particulate material is placed therein to form the particulate pack <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once the pack <b>124</b> of packing particulate material has achieved sufficient compressive strength, the at least an upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> is removed to expose the at least one perforation in the casing that had been previously covered by at least the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the at least one perforation that is exposed by the removal of the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> are the perforations <b>144</b> of the second production interval <b>108</b>. Thus, the upper portion of the plug, which is the second production interval <b>108</b> in the illustration, is removed to expose the perforations <b>144</b> of the second production interval <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a conduit <b>128</b> being lowered into the wellbore <b>100</b> and washing fluid that is being circulated to remove the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> to expose at least one perforation <b>144</b> in the casing <b>104</b> that had been previously covered by at least the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b>, here the second production interval <b>108</b> of the plug <b>136</b>. While the conduit <b>128</b> is pumped down or lowered to the lower, or second production interval <b>108</b>, any excess of the packing particulate material is removed or circulated out of the wellbore <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of the wellbore <b>100</b>, wherein a pack of second packing particulate material is formed in at least one perforation <b>144</b> exposed by removing at least the upper portion of the plug <b>136</b>. Thus, the perforations <b>144</b> in the casing <b>104</b> adjacent the lower production interval, here the second production interval <b>108</b>, are exposed, and a pack of the first packing particulate material is formed in the perforations <b>144</b> in the casing adjacent the lower production interval <b>108</b> by introducing a second carrier fluid comprising second particulates into the wellbore <b>100</b>. The second packing particulate can be the same or different than the first packing particulate, although it is preferably the same. For example, the first packing particulate material can be introduced into the packs with the first carrier fluid again.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The step of forming a pack of the second packing particulate material can comprise introducing a second carrier fluid with the second packing particulate material into the wellbore under conditions to form the pack of the second packing particulate material in the at least one perforation exposed by removing at least the upper portion of the plug. The carrier fluid and packing particulate material can be pumped down the annulus and squeezed into the exposed perforations of the upper production interval until a significant packing pressure is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment according to the invention, at least a next upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> is removed to expose at least one perforation in the casing that had been previously covered by at least the next upper portion of the plug <b>136</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the next production interval that will be removed is the third production interval <b>110</b> to expose perforations <b>146</b> of the third production interval <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The step of forming a pack of a next packing particulate material in the at least one perforation <b>146</b> exposed by removing the next upper portion of the plug <b>136</b> is then performed. The next packing particulate material can be the same or different from the first packing particulate material and the same or different from the second packing particulate material. The step of forming a pack of the next packing particulate material comprises introducing a next carrier fluid with the next packing particulate material into the wellbore <b>100</b> under conditions to form the pack of the next packing particulate material in the at least one perforation <b>146</b> exposed by removing the next upper portion of the plug <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of the wellbore <b>100</b>, wherein all perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, in the casing <b>104</b> are packed with particulate material by successively repeating the steps of removing at least a next upper portion of the plug and forming a pack of a next packing particulate material. Thus, at least an upper portion of the sand can be removed to expose some of the perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, in the casing <b>104</b> and forming a pack of next packing particulate material in the perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, for each lower production interval <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, or <b>112</b> are repeated until all perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> are packed with next packing particulate material.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After the packs have been packed with packing particulate material, the well can be shut-in to allow the packing particulate material in the perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b> to consolidate and gain compressive strength.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In certain embodiments, once particulate packs <b>124</b> have been formed in plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b>, particulate packs <b>124</b> can be contacted with a filling carrier fluid that contains filling particulate material. Generally, the filling particulate material is of a smaller size than any of the first, second, and next particulates so that the filling particulate material can plug at least a portion of the interstitial spaces between the first, second, and next particulates in particulate packs <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one certain embodiment, the filling carrier fluid containing the filling particulate material can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> as the pad fluid for a stimulation operation performed on first production interval <b>106</b>. The filling carrier fluid and filling particulate material will be discussed in more detail below. The filling carrier fluid for the filling particulate material can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> by any suitable manner, for example, by pumping the carrier fluid down conduit <b>128</b>. Generally, the filling carrier fluid can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> so that downhole pressures are sufficient for the filling carrier fluid to squeeze into particulate packs <b>124</b> and into production intervals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, but the downhole pressures are below production intervals' <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> respective fracture gradients.</p>

When a filter cake has formed at the surface of particulate packs <b>124</b>, the leak off rate of the filling carrier fluid into the matrix of subterranean formation <b>102</b> through particulate packs <b>124</b> should be reduced, as indicated by the rate of pressure fall off during shut-in immediately after pumping the filling carrier fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The method of the invention can also comprise the step of perforating the casing to form at least one perforation in the casing <b>104</b> before or after any step of the method.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The at least one remedial perforation in the casing adjacent to the production interval(s) can be stimulated through the at least one remedial perforation. One advantageous method of perforating and stimulating is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/004,441, processes of remedial perforation and/or stimulation can also be used. For example, a stimulation treatment can be simply pumped down the wellbore. The packed perforations are productive as is without perforation or stimulation. Also, the packed perforations can be stimulated without having to first perform a remedial perforation.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">These perforations are referred to as “remedial” because they are created after an initial completion process has been performed in the well.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, once the desired interval of subterranean formation <b>102</b>, such as first production interval <b>106</b>, has been stimulated, sufficient sand can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> via the stimulation fluid (e.g., annulus fluid, jetting fluid, or both) to form plug <b>136</b> in casing <b>104</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Once the hydraulic pressure is released, the sand should settle to form plug <b>136</b> adjacent to first casing interval <b>107</b> extending above at least one remedial perforation <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In certain embodiments, clean-out fluids optionally can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> by pumping down the conduit <b>128</b> into the wellbore <b>100</b>.

For example, a clean out fluid can be used after completion of the stimulation operations so as to remove the plugs, such as plug <b>136</b> that can be in wellbore <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the clean out fluid can be used after the carrier fluid has been introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> so as to remove any of the packing particulate material that is loose in wellbore <b>100</b>. Generally, the clean-out fluids should not be circulated into wellbore <b>100</b> at sufficient rates and pressures to impact the integrity of particulate packs <b>124</b>. Generally, the cleaning fluid can be any conventional fluid used to prepare a formation for stimulation, such as water-based or oil-based fluids. In some embodiments, these cleaning fluids can be energized fluids that contain a gas, such as nitrogen or air.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While the above-described steps describe the use of conduit <b>128</b> to introduce the carrier fluid and the filling carrier fluid into wellbore <b>100</b>, any suitable methodology can be used to introduce such fluids into wellbore <b>100</b>.

This can save at least one trip out of the wellbore, between the steps of packing the packing particulate material into plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and perforating at least one remedial perforation <b>132</b> because the same downhole equipment can be used for both steps. For example, hydraulic jetting tool <b>126</b> can have a longitudinal fluid flow passageway extending therethrough and optional valve subassembly <b>129</b> can have a longitudinal fluid flow passageway extending therethrough. When optional valve subassembly <b>129</b> is not activated, fluid flows down through work string <b>128</b>, into hydraulic jetting tool <b>126</b>, and out through optional valve subassembly <b>129</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the carrier fluid can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b> by pumping the carrier fluid down work string <b>128</b>, into hydraulic jetting tool <b>126</b>, and out into wellbore <b>100</b> through optional valve subassembly <b>129</b>. Similarly, filling carrier fluid also can be introduced into wellbore <b>100</b>. When desired to perform the above-described remedial perforation and/or stimulation steps, optional valve subassembly <b>129</b> should be activated thereby causing the flow of fluid to discharge through at least one port <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The first, second, and next carrier fluid for the first, second and next packing particulate material, respectively, can include any suitable fluids that can be used to transport packing particulates in subterranean operations. In one embodiment, the first, second, and next carrier fluid are selected to be the same. Suitable fluids for the first, second and third carrier fluid include ungelled aqueous fluids, aqueous gels, hydrocarbon-based gels, foams, emulsions, viscoelastic surfactant gels, and any other suitable fluid. Where the carrier fluid is an ungelled aqueous fluid, it should be introduced into the wellbore at a sufficient rate to transport the packing particulate material. Suitable emulsions can be comprised of two immiscible liquids such as an aqueous liquid or gelled liquid and a hydrocarbon. Foams can be created by the addition of a gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen. Suitable aqueous gels are generally comprised of water and one or more gelling agents.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a one embodiment, the carrier fluid for the packing particulate material is an aqueous gel comprised of water, a gelling agent for gelling the aqueous component and increasing its viscosity, and, optionally, a crosslinking agent for crosslinking the gel and further increasing the viscosity of the fluid. The increased viscosity of the gelled, or gelled and crosslinked, aqueous gels, inter alia, reduces fluid loss and enhances the suspension properties thereof. An example of a suitable crosslinked aqueous gel is a borate fluid system utilized in the “Delta Frac®” fracturing service, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan Okla. Another example of a suitable crosslinked aqueous gel is a borate fluid system utilized in the “Seaquest®” fracturing service, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan, Okla. The water used to form the aqueous gel can be fresh water, saltwater, brine, or any other aqueous liquid that does not adversely react with the other components. The density of the water can be increased to provide additional particle transport and suspension in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As mentioned above, the first, second, and next packing particulate material can be selected to be the same or different. The packing particulate material is selected to be of a size to pack a perforation <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b> in the casing <b>104</b>. Furthermore, the first, second, and next carrier fluid that carries first, second and next packing particulate material can be selected to be the same or different. The packing particulate material as used in accordance with the invention are generally particulate of a size such that the particulate bridge plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> in casing <b>104</b> and form proppant packs <b>124</b> therein. The packing particulate for use in the packing particulate material can have an average particle size in the range of from about 10 mesh to about 100 mesh. A wide variety of particulates can be used as the first, second, and next packing particulate material in accordance with the invention. For example, the first, second, and the next packing particulate material can be independently selected from the group consisting of sand; bauxite; ceramic materials; glass materials; polymer materials; synthetic fluorine-containing polymeric materials, e.g., TEFLON®; nut shell pieces; seed shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising nut shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising seed shell pieces; fruit pit pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising fruit pit pieces; wood; composite particulates; and combinations thereof. Suitable composite particulates can comprise a binder and a filler material wherein suitable filler materials include silica, alumina, fumed carbon, carbon black, graphite, mica, titanium dioxide, meta-silicate, calcium silicate, kaolin, talc, zirconia, boron, fly ash, hollow glass microspheres, solid glass, and combinations thereof. Generally, the packing particulate material can be present in the carrier fluid in an amount in an amount sufficient to form the desired proppant packs <b>124</b> in plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>. In some embodiments, the packing particulate material, can be present in the carrier fluid in an amount in the range of from about 2 pounds to about 12 pounds per gallon of the carrier fluid not inclusive of the packing particulate material.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Generally, the packing particulate material does not degrade in the presence of hydrocarbon fluids and other fluids present in portion of the subterranean formation; this allows the packing particulate material to maintain their integrity in the presence of produced hydrocarbon products, formation water, and other compositions normally produced from subterranean formations. However, in some embodiments of the invention, the packing particulate material can comprise degradable materials. Degradable materials can be included in the packing particulate material, for example, so that proppant packs <b>124</b> can degrade over time. Such degradable materials are capable of undergoing an irreversible degradation downhole. The term “irreversible” as used herein means that the degradable material, once degraded downhole, should not recrystallize or reconsolidate, e.g., the degradable material should degrade in situ but should not recrystallize or reconsolidate in situ.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The degradable materials can degrade by any suitable mechanism. Suitable degradable materials can be water-soluble, gas-soluble, oil-soluble, biodegradable, temperature degradable, solvent-degradable, acid-soluble, oxidizer-degradable, or a combination thereof. Suitable degradable materials include a variety of degradable materials suitable for use in subterranean operations and can comprise dehydrated materials, waxes, boric acid flakes, degradable polymers, calcium carbonate, paraffins, crosslinked polymer gels, combinations thereof, and the like. One example of a suitable degradable crosslinked polymer gel is “Max Seal™” fluid loss control additive, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan, Okla. An example of a suitable degradable polymeric material is “BioBalls™” perforation ball sealers, commercially available from Santrol Corporation, Fresno, Tex.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the degradable material comprises an oil-soluble material. Where such oil-soluble materials are used, the oil-soluble materials can be degraded by the produced fluids, thus degrading particulate packs <b>124</b> so as to unblock plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>. Suitable oil-soluble materials include either natural or synthetic polymers, such as, for example, polyacrylics, polyamides, and polyolefins (such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, and polystyrene).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Suitable examples of degradable polymers that can be used in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, homopolymers, random, block, graft, and star- and hyper-branched polymers. Specific examples of suitable polymers include polysaccharides (such as dextran or cellulose); chitin; chitosan; proteins; aliphatic polyesters; poly(lactide); poly(glycolide); poly(ε-caprolactone); poly(hydroxybutyrate); poly(anhydrides); aliphatic polycarbonates; poly(ortho esters); poly(amino acids); poly(ethylene oxide); polyphosphazenes; copolymers thereof; and combinations thereof. Polyanhydrides are another type of particularly suitable degradable polymer useful in the invention. Examples of suitable polyanhydrides include poly(adipic anhydride), poly(suberic anhydride), poly(sebacic anhydride), poly(dodecanedioic anhydride). Other suitable examples include but are not limited to poly(maleic anhydride) and poly(benzoic anhydride). One skilled in the art will recognize that plasticizers can be included in forming suitable polymeric degradable materials of the invention. The plasticizers can be present in an amount sufficient to provide the desired characteristics, for example, more effective compatibilization of the melt blend components, improved processing characteristics during the blending and processing steps, and control and regulation of the sensitivity and degradation of the polymer by moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Suitable dehydrated compounds are those materials that will degrade over time when rehydrated. For example, a particulate solid dehydrated salt or a particulate solid anhydrous borate material that degrades over time can be suitable. Specific examples of particulate solid anhydrous borate materials that can be used include but are not limited to anhydrous sodium tetraborate (also known as anhydrous borax), and anhydrous boric acid. These anhydrous borate materials are only slightly soluble in water. However, with time and heat in a subterranean environment, the anhydrous borate materials react with the surrounding aqueous fluid and are hydrated. The resulting hydrated borate materials are substantially soluble in water as compared to anhydrous borate materials and as a result degrade in the aqueous fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Blends of certain degradable materials and other compounds can also be suitable. One example of a suitable blend of materials is a mixture of poly(lactic acid) and sodium borate where the mixing of an acid and base could result in a neutral solution where this is desirable. Another example would include a blend of poly(lactic acid) and boric oxide. In choosing the appropriate degradable material or materials, one should consider the degradation products that will result. The degradation products should not adversely affect subterranean operations or components. The choice of degradable material also can depend, at least in part, on the conditions of the well, e.g., wellbore temperature. For instance, lactides have been found to be suitable for lower temperature wells, including those within the range of 60° F. to 150° F., and polylactides have been found to be suitable for wellbore temperatures above this range. Poly(lactic acid) and dehydrated salts can be suitable for higher temperature wells. Also, in some embodiments a preferable result is achieved if the degradable material degrades slowly over time as opposed to instantaneously. In some embodiments, it can be desirable when the degradable material does not substantially degrade until after the degradable material has been substantially placed in a desired location within a subterranean formation.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In certain embodiments of the invention, the packing particulates are coated with an adhesive substance. As used herein, the term “adhesive substance” refers to a material that is capable of being coated onto a particulate and that exhibits a sticky or tacky character such that the proppant particulates that have adhesive thereon have a tendency to create clusters or aggregates. As used herein, the term “tacky,” in all of its forms, generally refers to a substance having a nature such that it is (or can be activated to become) somewhat sticky to the touch. Generally, the packing particulates can be coated with an adhesive substance so that the packing particulate material once placed within plurality of perforations <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> to form particulate packs <b>124</b> can consolidate into the packing particulate material into a hardened mass. Adhesive substances suitable for use in the invention include non-aqueous tackifying agents; aqueous tackifying agents; silyl-modified polyamides; and curable resin compositions that are capable of curing to form hardened substances.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Tackifying agents suitable for use in the consolidation fluids of the invention comprise any compound that, when in liquid form or in a solvent solution, will form a non-hardening coating upon a particulate. A particularly preferred group of tackifying agents comprise polyamides that are liquids or in solution at the temperature of the subterranean formation such that they are, by themselves, non-hardening when introduced into the subterranean formation. A particularly preferred product is a condensation reaction product comprised of commercially available polyacids and a polyamine. Such commercial products include compounds such as mixtures of C<sub>36 </sub>dibasic acids containing some trimer and higher oligomers and also small amounts of monomer acids that are reacted with polyamines. Other polyacids include trimer acids, synthetic acids produced from fatty acids, maleic anhydride, acrylic acid, and the like. Such acid compounds are commercially available from companies such as Witco Corporation, Union Camp, Chemtall, and Emery Industries. The reaction products are available from, for example, Champion Technologies, Inc. and Witco Corporation. Additional compounds which can be used as tackifying compounds include liquids and solutions of, for example, polyesters, polycarbonates and polycarbamates, natural resins such as shellac and the like. Other suitable tackifying agents are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,853,048 and 5,833,000, the relevant disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Tackifying agents suitable for use in the invention can be either used such that they form a non-hardening coating or they can be combined with a multifunctional material capable of reacting with the tackifying compound to form a hardened coating. A “hardened coating” as used herein means that the reaction of the tackifying compound with the multifunctional material will result in a substantially non-flowable reaction product that exhibits a higher compressive strength in a consolidated agglomerate than the tackifying compound alone with the particulates. In this instance, the tackifying agent can function similarly to a hardenable resin. Multifunctional materials suitable for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, aldehydes such as formaldehyde, dialdehydes such as glutaraldehyde, hemiacetals or aldehyde releasing compounds, diacid halides, dihalides such as dichlorides and dibromides, polyacid anhydrides such as citric acid, epoxides, furfuraldehyde, glutaraldehyde or aldehyde condensates and the like, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments of the invention, the multifunctional material can be mixed with the tackifying compound in an amount of from about 0.01 to about 50 percent by weight of the tackifying compound to effect formation of the reaction product. In some preferable embodiments, the compound is present in an amount of from about 0.5 to about 1 percent by weight of the tackifying compound. Suitable multifunctional materials are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,839,510, issued Nov. 24, 1998, with inventors Jim D. Weaver; Philip D. Nguyen; James R. Stanford; Bobby K. Bowles; Steven F. Wilson; Cole R. Clay; Mark A. Parker; Brahmadeo T. Dewprashad, the relevant disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Other suitable tackifying agents are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,853,048, issued Dec. 29, 1998, with inventors Jim D. Weaver; James R. Stanford; Philip D. Nguyen; Bobby K. Bowles; Steven F. Wilson; Brahmadeo Dewprashad; Mark A. Parker.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Solvents suitable for use with the tackifying agents of the invention include any solvent that is compatible with the tackifying agent and achieves the desired viscosity effect. The solvents that can be used in the invention preferably include those having high flash points (most preferably above about 125° F.). Examples of solvents suitable for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, butylglycidyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, butyl bottom alcohol, dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethyleneglycol methyl ether, ethyleneglycol butyl ether, methanol, butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, diethyleneglycol butyl ether, propylene carbonate, d'limonene, 2-butoxy ethanol, butyl acetate, furfuryl acetate, butyl lactate, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, fatty acid methyl esters, and combinations thereof. It is within the ability of one skilled in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, to determine whether a solvent is needed to achieve a viscosity suitable to the subterranean conditions and, if so, how much.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Suitable aqueous tackifier agents are capable of forming at least a partial coating upon the surface of the packing particulates. Generally, suitable aqueous tackifier agents are not significantly tacky when placed onto a particulate, but are capable of being “activated” (that is destabilized, coalesced and/or reacted) to transform the compound into a sticky, tackifying compound at a desirable time. Such activation can occur before, during, or after the aqueous tackifier compound is placed in the subterranean formation. In some embodiments, a pretreatment can be first contacted with the surface of a particulate to prepare it to be coated with an aqueous tackifier compound. Suitable aqueous tackifying agents are generally charged polymers that comprise compounds that, when in an aqueous solvent or solution, will form a non-hardening coating (by itself or with an activator) and, when placed on a particulate, will increase the continuous critical resuspension velocity of the particulate when contacted by a stream of water.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Examples of aqueous tackifier agents suitable for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, acrylic acid polymers, acrylic acid ester polymers, acrylic acid derivative polymers, acrylic acid homopolymers, acrylic acid ester homopolymers (such as poly(methyl acrylate), poly (butyl acrylate), and poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate)), acrylic acid ester co-polymers, methacrylic acid derivative polymers, methacrylic acid homopolymers, methacrylic acid ester homopolymers (such as poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(butyl methacrylate), and poly(2-ethylhexyl methacryate)), acrylamido-methyl-propane sulfonate polymers, acrylamido-methyl-propane sulfonate derivative polymers, acrylamido-methyl-propane sulfonate co-polymers, and acrylic acid/acrylamido-methyl-propane sulfonate co-polymers and combinations thereof. Methods of determining suitable aqueous tackifier agents and additional disclosure on aqueous tackifier agents can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/864,061 and filed Jun. 9, 2004 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/864,618 and filed Jun. 9, 2004, the relevant disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Silyl-modified polyamide compounds suitable for use as an adhesive substance in the methods of the invention can be described as substantially self-hardening compositions that are capable of at least partially adhering to particulates in the unhardened state, and that are further capable of self-hardening themselves to a substantially non-tacky state to which individual particulates such as formation fines will not adhere. Such silyl-modified polyamides can be based, for example, on the reaction product of a silating compound with a polyamide or a mixture of polyamides. The polyamide or mixture of polyamides can be one or more polyamide intermediate compounds obtained, for example, from the reaction of a polyacid (e.g., diacid or higher) with a polyamine (e.g., diamine or higher) to form a polyamide polymer with the elimination of water. Other suitable silyl-modified polyamides and methods of making such compounds are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,439,309, issued Aug. 27, 2002, having named inventors Ronald M. Matherly, Allan R. Rickards, and Jeffrey C. Dawson; the relevant disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Curable resin compositions suitable for use in the consolidation fluids of the invention generally comprise any suitable resin that is capable of forming a hardened, consolidated mass. Many such resins are commonly used in subterranean consolidation operations, and some suitable resins include two component epoxy based resins, novolak resins, polyepoxide resins, phenol-aldehyde resins, urea-aldehyde resins, urethane resins, phenolic resins, furan resins, furan/furfuryl alcohol resins, phenolic/latex resins, phenol formaldehyde resins, polyester resins and hybrids and copolymers thereof, polyurethane resins and hybrids and copolymers thereof, acrylate resins, and mixtures thereof. Some suitable resins, such as epoxy resins, can be cured with an internal catalyst or activator so that when pumped down hole, they can be cured using only time and temperature. Other suitable resins, such as furan resins generally require a time-delayed catalyst or an external catalyst to help activate the polymerization of the resins if the cure temperature is low (i.e., less than 250° F.), but will cure under the effect of time and temperature if the formation temperature is above about 250° F., preferably above about 300° F. It is within the ability of one skilled in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, to select a suitable resin for use in embodiments of the invention and to determine whether a catalyst is required to trigger curing.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, the curable resin composition further can contain a solvent. Any solvent that is compatible with the resin and achieves the desired viscosity effect is suitable for use in the invention. Preferred solvents include those listed above in connection with tackifying compounds. It is within the ability of one skilled in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, to determine whether and how much solvent is needed to achieve a suitable viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The filling carrier fluid that can be used in accordance with the invention can include any suitable fluids that can be used to transport the filling particulates in subterranean operations. Suitable fluids include ungelled aqueous fluids, aqueous gels, hydrocarbon-based gels, foams, emulsions, viscoelastic surfactant gels, and any other suitable fluid. Where the filling carrier fluid is an ungelled aqueous fluid, it should be introduced into the wellbore at a sufficient rate to transport the packing particulate material. Suitable emulsions can be comprised of two immiscible liquids such as an aqueous liquid or gelled liquid and a hydrocarbon. Foams can be created by the addition of a gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen. Suitable aqueous gels are generally comprised of water and one or more gelling agents. In some embodiments, the filling carrier fluid is an aqueous gel comprised of water, a gelling agent for gelling the aqueous component and increasing its viscosity, and, optionally, a crosslinking agent for crosslinking the gel and further increasing the viscosity of the fluid. The increased viscosity of the gelled, or gelled and crosslinked, aqueous gels, inter alia, reduces fluid loss and enhances the suspension properties thereof. An example of a suitable crosslinked aqueous gel is a borate fluid system utilized in the “Delta Frac®” fracturing service, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan Okla. Another example of a suitable crosslinked aqueous gel is a borate fluid system utilized in the “Seaquest®” fracturing service, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan, Okla. The water used to form the aqueous gel can be fresh water, saltwater, brine, or any other aqueous liquid that does not adversely react with the other components. The density of the water can be increased to provide additional particle transport and suspension in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As mentioned above, the filling carrier fluid contains filling particulate material. The filling particulate material used in accordance with the invention are generally particulate materials having an average particle size smaller than the average particle size of the packing particulate material so that the filling particulates can plug at least a portion of the interstitial spaces between the packing particulate material in packs <b>124</b>. In certain embodiments, the filling particulate material used can have an average particle size of less than about 100 mesh. The filling particulate material can be selected to be the same as the first packing particulate material and the second packing particulate material except for the size of the filling particulate material. Examples of suitable particulate materials that can be used as the second particulates include, but are not limited to, silica flour; sand; bauxite; ceramic materials; glass materials; polymer materials; synthetic fluorine-containing polymeric materials, e.g., TEFLON®; nut shell pieces; seed shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising nut shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising seed shell pieces; fruit pit pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising fruit pit pieces; wood; composite particulates; and combinations thereof. Suitable composite particulates can comprise a binder and a filler material wherein suitable filler materials include silica, alumina, fumed carbon, carbon black, graphite, mica, titanium dioxide, meta-silicate, calcium silicate, kaolin, talc, zirconia, boron, fly ash, hollow glass microspheres, solid glass, and combinations thereof. Generally, the filling particulate material should be included in the filling carrier fluid in an amount sufficient to form the desired filter cake on the surface of proppant packs <b>124</b>. In certain embodiments, the filling particulate material can be present in the filling carrier fluid in an amount in the range of from about 30 pounds to about 100 pounds per 1,000 gallons of the filling carrier fluid not inclusive of the filling particulate material. In certain embodiments, the filling particulate material can comprise degradable particulates of the type described above.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The stimulation and jetting fluids that can be used in accordance with the invention can include any suitable fluids that can be used in subterranean stimulation operations. In some embodiments, the stimulation fluid can have substantially the same composition as the jetting fluid. Suitable fluids include ungelled aqueous fluids, aqueous gels, hydrocarbon-based gels, foams, emulsions, viscoelastic surfactant gels, acidizing treatment fluids (e.g., acid blends) and any other suitable fluid. In some embodiments, the stimulation fluid and/or jetting fluid can contain an acid. Where the stimulation or jetting fluid is an ungelled aqueous fluid, it should be introduced into the wellbore at a sufficient rate to transport proppant (where present). Suitable emulsions can be comprised of two immiscible liquids such as an aqueous gelled liquid and a liquefied, normally gaseous, fluid, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen. Foams can be created by the addition of a gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen. Suitable aqueous gels are generally comprised of water and one or more gelling agents.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some embodiments, the jetting fluid and/or stimulation fluid is an aqueous gel comprised of water, a gelling agent for gelling the aqueous component and increasing its viscosity, and, optionally, a crosslinking agent for crosslinking the gel and further increasing the viscosity of the fluid. The increased viscosity of the gelled, or gelled and crosslinked, aqueous gels, inter alia, reduces fluid loss and enhances the suspension properties thereof. The water used to form the aqueous gel can be fresh water, saltwater, brine, or any other aqueous liquid that does not adversely react with the other components. The density of the water can be increased to provide additional particle transport and suspension in the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to determine the appropriate stimulation and/or jetting fluid for a particulate application.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Optionally, proppant can be included in the stimulation fluid, the jetting fluid, or both. Among other things, proppant can be included to prevent fractures formed in the subterranean formation from fully closing once the hydraulic pressure is released. A variety of suitable proppant can be used, for example, sand; bauxite; ceramic materials; glass materials; polymer materials; synthetic fluorine-containing polymeric materials, e.g., TEFLON®; nut shell pieces; seed shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising nut shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising seed shell pieces; fruit pit pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising fruit pit pieces; wood; composite particulates; and combinations thereof.
