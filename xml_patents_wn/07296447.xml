<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wireless lock assembly includes a latch assembly that includes a wireless, electrically operated latching component, and a manually movable latching component. The wireless, electrically operated latching component is movable between activated and inactivated positions. The electrically operated latching component will remain in the activated position for a predetermined period of time, after which it will return to the inactivated position. The lock assembly also includes a handle assembly that is manually movable from a non-enabled position into an enabled position when the electrically operated latching component is moved to its activated position. When the handle assembly is in its enabled position, it can be manually moved so as to move the manually movable latching component from a locking condition to a releasing condition. The handle assembly can be manually moved from its non-enabled position to its enabled position by manual engagement and depression of an exposed surface portion thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to vending machine locks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior art vending machine locks have been known to be subject to vandalism, for example, by drilling. In addition, many of the prior art vending machine locks provide poor access control. Several other shortcomings also exist. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved vending machine lock.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the invention, a wireless lock assembly is provided. The lock assembly includes a latch assembly that includes a wireless, electrically operated latching component, and a manually movable latching component. The wireless, electrically operated latching component is movable between activated and inactivated positions. The electrically operated latching component will remain in the activated position for a predetermined period of time, after which it will return to the inactivated position. The lock assembly also includes a handle assembly that is manually movable from a non-enabled position into an enabled position when the electrically operated latching component is moved to its activated position. When the handle assembly is in its enabled position, it can be manually moved so as to move the manually movable latching component from a locking condition to a releasing condition. The handle assembly can be manually moved from its non-enabled position to its enabled position by manual engagement and depression of an exposed surface portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the invention, a wireless lock assembly for being mounted on a vending machine door and for locking the vending machine door to a vending machine body is provided. The wireless lock assembly includes a latch assembly that includes a wireless, electrically operated latching component, and a manually movable latching component. The manually movable latching component includes a bolt that is engageable with a bolt receiver to be carried by the vending machine body. The lock assembly also includes a handle assembly that includes a handle portion. The handle assembly is manually movable between a non-enabled position in which the handle portion is retracted, and an enabled position in which the handle portion is extended. When the handle portion is extended, it can be manually engaged and moved in a predetermined manner. The handle portion is operatively connected with the manually movable latching component so that manual movement of the handle component in the predetermined manner will operate to move the bolt in a disengaged relation with the bolt receiver. The handle portion can be manually moved from being retracted to being extended when the electrically operated latching component has been actuated. The handle portion is retained in said retracted position by a detent and is moved to the extended position by a spring in response to manual release of the detent.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The lock assembly <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises, among other components, a latch assembly <b>102</b> and a handle assembly <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The latch assembly <b>102</b> includes a steel case shell <b>106</b>, which houses a solenoid assembly <b>108</b>. The solenoid contains coil windings, which, when energized, creates an electromagnetic field that drives an internal plunger <b>111</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that extends through the middle of the coil windings. The distal end of the internal plunger <b>111</b> mates with a plastic plunger attachment <b>110</b>. The plunger <b>111</b> and plunger attachment <b>110</b> both have a central aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A locking bolt assembly <b>112</b>, shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is in the form of an assembly that includes a bolt portion <b>113</b> having threads <b>114</b>, and a driver portion <b>116</b>. End portion <b>118</b> of the driver portion <b>116</b> is received within an axial opening (not shown) in end <b>120</b> of bolt portion <b>113</b>. A pin <b>122</b> is received in an opening <b>124</b> in a side portion of the bolt portion <b>113</b>. The pin <b>122</b> extends through a slot <b>126</b> in end portion <b>118</b> of driver portion <b>116</b>. The driver portion <b>116</b>, at certain operation points, is permitted to move longitudinally, relative to the bolt portion <b>113</b>. The movement is limited by the length of slot <b>126</b>, which receives the pin <b>122</b>. A coil spring <b>128</b> biases the driver portion <b>116</b> away (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from the bolt portion <b>113</b>. A spacer <b>130</b> prevents the end portion <b>118</b> from entering into and binding with coil spring <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The driver portion <b>116</b> has a “double D” cross-sectional configuration and extends through a central aperture in a nylon washer <b>132</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and through the central aperture in the aforementioned plunger <b>111</b> and plunger attachment <b>110</b>. The nylon washer <b>132</b> is in the assembly to create a gap between the plunger <b>111</b> and the bolt <b>113</b>. The bolt is ferrous, so when the plunger <b>111</b> is magnetized (solenoid is powered) it tends to be attracted to the bolt rather than the solenoid assembly <b>108</b> without the washer. The plunger <b>111</b> is not attached to any other component and is allowed to travel axially along the driver <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the handle assembly <b>104</b> includes a main handle member <b>140</b>, which is made from hardened steel. Subsequent to hardening, the steel is chrome finished for aesthetic purposes, as it will constitute essentially the only showing surface when the bolt assembly is in a locking configuration with a vending machine door. The handle member <b>140</b> has a generally “T” shaped configuration, with a stem portion <b>142</b> and a hand engaging portion <b>144</b>. The stem portion <b>142</b> is received within a front bore <b>149</b> of the case shell <b>106</b>, and has an underside surface <b>146</b> that is slightly spaced from a front surface <b>148</b> of the case shell <b>106</b> that surrounds the front bore <b>149</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The stem portion <b>142</b> of the handle member <b>140</b> is essentially cylindrical and hollow in shape and defines an opening <b>143</b>, with a flattened internal surface portion <b>145</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The stem portion <b>142</b> carries therein a cam spring <b>147</b>, having one end <b>150</b> bearing against an inner surface of the handle member <b>140</b>, and an opposite end <b>152</b> bearing against end surfaces <b>154</b> of a cam member <b>156</b>. The stem portion <b>142</b> also contains a detent member <b>160</b>. As will be described, the detent member <b>160</b> is capable of limited movement in a direction along axis A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is perpendicular to the lock axis B. The detent member <b>160</b> has side flanges <b>162</b>, which are received in slots <b>164</b> of cam member <b>156</b>. The detent member <b>160</b> is slidably mounted relative to a detent clip <b>166</b>, which is secured inside the stem portion <b>142</b> by a dowel pin <b>168</b>. The dowel pin <b>168</b> also extends through the center of a coil spring <b>170</b> and a lower opening <b>171</b> in the detent member <b>160</b>. The coil spring <b>170</b> biases the detent member <b>160</b> upwards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, although movement of the detent member <b>160</b> along axis A when the handle assembly <b>104</b> is at rest is prevented due to engagement of the side flanges <b>162</b> in slots <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the lock assembly <b>100</b> is at rest in a locking configuration, an upper end <b>174</b> of the detent member extends through a side opening <b>176</b> in stem portion <b>142</b>, and at least partially extends through an aligned opening <b>178</b> in the case shell <b>106</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, when the lock assembly <b>100</b> is at rest in a locking condition, the threads <b>114</b> of bolt portion <b>113</b> threaded to receiving threads within the vending machine to prevent axial movement of the bolt portion <b>113</b>, and to lock the door that carries the lock assembly <b>100</b>. The coil spring <b>128</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which bears at one end <b>180</b> thereof against the axially fixed bolt portion <b>113</b> and at the other end <b>182</b> against spacer <b>130</b>, and hence end portion <b>118</b>, has the effect of biasing the driver portion to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, into the opening <b>143</b> and against the inner surface of the handle engaging portion <b>144</b>. More specifically, the driver portion <b>116</b> extends through opening <b>184</b> in cam member <b>156</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), opening <b>186</b> of insert <b>188</b>, through nylon spacer <b>190</b>, through the coils of cam spring <b>147</b>, and into opening <b>143</b> so as to bear against an inner surface of the handle engaging portion <b>144</b>. Thus, the driver portion <b>116</b> applies a biasing force to handle member <b>140</b> along axis B, toward the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> when the lock assembly <b>100</b> is at rest. This biasing force results in back region <b>192</b> of the detent member <b>160</b> frictionally bearing against side surface <b>194</b> on the proximate side defining the side opening <b>176</b> in stem portion <b>142</b>. As a further result, upper front region <b>196</b> of the detent member <b>160</b> frictionally bears against the side surface <b>198</b> on the distal side defining the side opening <b>178</b> in case shell <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the solenoid assembly <b>108</b> is activated, it forces the plunger <b>111</b>, and hence plunger attachment <b>110</b>, to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The plunger attachment <b>110</b> will thus be forced against end surface <b>200</b> of cam member <b>156</b>, causing the cam member <b>156</b> to move to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> until the side flanges <b>162</b> reach the portion of slot <b>164</b> which transitions into cam ramp <b>202</b>. At this point, the frictional forces applied to regions <b>192</b> and <b>196</b> of detent member, combined with the force of coil spring <b>170</b>, prevents the detent member <b>160</b> from moving downwards along axis A, and hence prevents the cam member <b>156</b> from moving further to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At this point, the user may elect to manually engage the front surface <b>204</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the handle member <b>140</b> (which is normally essentially flush with the front surface of the vending machine door) to force the handle member <b>140</b> to the right against the force of spring <b>128</b>, causing the driver portion <b>116</b> to move further into the opening <b>120</b> in the bolt portion <b>113</b>, with pin <b>122</b> riding in slot <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a result of handle member <b>140</b> being manually forced inwards (towards the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the detent <b>160</b> is carried therewith so as to be moved to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> so that front region <b>196</b> is moved off of surface <b>198</b> of case shell <b>106</b> to release the frictional engagement therebetween, and with enough force so that the side flanges <b>162</b> are forced to ride down the cam ramp <b>202</b>, against the bias of coil spring <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The detent member <b>160</b> is moved down sufficiently so that the upper end <b>174</b> thereof moves out of locking engagement with the side surface <b>198</b> in the side opening <b>178</b> of case shell <b>106</b>. When the handle member <b>140</b> is released, the detent member <b>160</b> rides back up the ramp, but not enough to allow it to engage the slot in the case. With the solenoid assembly powered, the plunger attachment <b>110</b> remains displaced keeping the cam <b>156</b> displaced as the handle <b>140</b> is released. This minimizes the travel of the detent on the ramp sufficiently to keep it from re-locking as the handle is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When manual inward force to the handle member <b>140</b> is released, the detent member <b>160</b> remains down (it does start to move back “up,” but not enough to engage the case) and the handle member is pushed outwardly along axis B (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) so as to protrude sufficiently beyond the case shell <b>106</b> and front surface of the vending machine door to enable the hand engaging portion to be manually grasped, with fingers reaching under the underside surface <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The user is then able to rotate the handle member <b>140</b> in a counterclockwise direction. This rotation is translated to the locking bolt <b>112</b>, through the insert <b>188</b>. Specifically, the peripheral configuration of insert <b>188</b> cooperates with the inner surface configuration of handle stem portion <b>142</b>, with one end <b>189</b> of the insert <b>188</b> (the lower end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) being received in the flattened surface region <b>145</b> of the stem portion interior and the opposite end <b>191</b> mating with the cylindrical inner surface region of the stem portion interior. Thus, rotation of handle member <b>140</b> rotates the insert <b>188</b>. In addition, the opening <b>186</b> in the insert <b>188</b> has a “double-D” configuration mating with the “double-D” configuration of the bolt driver portion <b>116</b> to cause rotational movement of the driver portion <b>116</b> and hence bolt portion <b>113</b>, through the pin <b>122</b> and slot <b>126</b> connection therebetween. Rotation of bolt portion <b>113</b> enables the threads <b>114</b> thereof to become disengaged with the cooperating threads within the body of the vending machine to enable the bolt <b>113</b> to become released from locking engagement. Thus, the vending machine door can then be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, an anti-drill protective sleeve <b>210</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at least partially surrounds a stem portion <b>212</b> of casing <b>106</b>. The protective sleeve <b>210</b> is made from a hardened steel, such as SAE 1090 or 1095 that substantially prevents vandalism by someone attempting to drill through the lock assembly from the side of the unit. The detent <b>160</b> is the primary component protected by the sleeve <b>210</b>. A micro-circuit <b>300</b>, discussed in further detail below, and the solenoid assembly <b>108</b> also receive additional protection. In addition, the hardened steel of front surface <b>204</b> of the handle member <b>140</b> prevent drilling from the front of the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A bolt spring <b>212</b>, washer <b>214</b>, and e-clip <b>216</b> are placed on the assembly to absorb the energy imparted to the entire assembly when the door is “slammed closed.” As the door of a vending machine is closed, the bolt <b>112</b> is forced into engagement with its mating nut on the body of the machine. The impact of this collision can be substantial depending on the velocity imparted to the door. To negate this energy, the design allows the bolt relative movement to the case along its axis. As this movement occurs, the e-clip <b>216</b> attached to the bolt <b>112</b> presses against a washer <b>214</b> which in turn compresses a spring <b>212</b> against the end of the case. Ultimately the kinetic energy generated by the impact is converted to potential energy in the spring <b>212</b>, keeping the energy dissipation from occurring in the other components of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the solenoid assembly <b>108</b> is operated upon an appropriate electrical signal received from a wireless micro-circuit <b>300</b> which is electrically communicated with the solenoid. The solenoid assembly <b>108</b> and wireless micro-circuit <b>300</b> together form an electrically operated latching component <b>310</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The wireless micro-circuit <b>300</b> has a wireless signal receiver and will energize the solenoid assembly <b>108</b> when it receives a predetermined wireless signal to which it is programmed to receive from a remote control transmitter device that can be carried by service personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the micro-circuit <b>300</b> maintains the solenoid assembly <b>108</b> energized for a predetermined period of time, such as 8-15 seconds, and more preferably 10 seconds. As a result, if within this predetermined period the operator does not apply manual force to the front surface <b>204</b> of the handle member <b>140</b>, the operator will not subsequently be able to manually release the lock unless the solenoid is re-energized again. That is, when the solenoid is energized, the cam member <b>156</b> is axially forced along axis B by the solenoid plunger. The cam member moves so that the slots <b>164</b> are positioned such that the side flanges <b>162</b> are at intersection of the slots <b>164</b> and cam ramp <b>202</b>. In this position, the lock assembly is not unlocked, but is in a position that enables manual unlocking by pushing the front surface <b>204</b> inwards so that the detent member <b>160</b> is moved towards the solenoid and the side flanges <b>162</b> are forced along cam ramp <b>202</b> so as to move the detent member <b>160</b> inwards relative to the handle member <b>140</b>, along axis A, into the unlocking position thereof. However, if the front surface <b>204</b> of the handle member <b>140</b> is not pushed in within the predetermined period of time during which the solenoid remains activated (e.g., 8-15 seconds), then the solenoid will return to its original state, and the cam member <b>156</b> will move therewith so that the side flanges <b>162</b> are positioned closer towards the open end of the slots <b>164</b>, away from cam ramp <b>202</b>. Thus, manual force applied to front surface <b>204</b> after the predetermined activation period will have no effect on the lock assembly <b>100</b>. As a result, inadvertent actuation of the solenoid by service personnel (e.g., when leaving the vending machine) will not enable unlocking of the lock assembly by the public because the lock assembly <b>100</b> will automatically return to a state in which it cannot be manually unlocked with a short time period.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Another embodiment of a lock assembly <b>400</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the lock assembly <b>400</b> includes a handle <b>402</b>, a latch assembly <b>404</b>, and a locking bolt assembly <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The handle <b>402</b> is preferably made from hardened steel, and may have a chrome finish. The handle <b>402</b> has a generally “T” shaped configuration, with a stem portion <b>408</b> and a hand engaging portion <b>410</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The hand engaging portion <b>410</b>, which may also be referred to as a manually engageable portion, is configured to be received by a person's hand, as will be discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The latch assembly <b>404</b> includes a case shell <b>412</b> that is configured to receive a pair of solenoids <b>414</b>. The solenoids <b>414</b> are disposed on opposite sides of a longitudinal axis <b>416</b> that extends through the case shell <b>412</b>. The case shell <b>412</b> receives the stem portion <b>408</b> of the handle <b>402</b> at one end, and the locking bolt assembly <b>406</b> at an opposite end, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The locking bolt assembly <b>406</b> includes a bolt <b>418</b> that has threads <b>420</b> on an exterior surface thereof, and a coupler <b>422</b> that is connected to the bolt <b>418</b> at one end and to a driver <b>424</b> at an opposite end. The coupler <b>422</b> and the case shell <b>412</b> are constructed and arranged so that the coupler <b>422</b> may be connected to the case shell <b>412</b> with a clip <b>425</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the case shell <b>412</b> and the coupler <b>422</b> are configured such that the coupler <b>422</b> is received by the case shell <b>412</b> via an opening in the case shell <b>412</b>, and is positioned relative to the case shell <b>412</b> via a shoulder <b>427</b>. The clip <b>425</b> secures the coupler <b>422</b> so that the coupler <b>422</b> is fixed in the axial direction, i.e., along the longitudinal axis <b>416</b>, but may rotate about the longitudinal axis <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the bolt <b>418</b> is received by the coupler <b>422</b> and is connected to the coupler <b>422</b> via a pin <b>426</b> that extends from one outer surface of the coupler <b>422</b>, through a slot <b>428</b> in the bolt <b>418</b>, and to the opposite outer surface of the coupler <b>422</b>. This configuration allows the bolt <b>418</b> to move a limited distance, i.e., the length of the slot <b>428</b>, relative to the coupler <b>422</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>416</b>, and also allows the bolt <b>418</b> to rotate about the longitudinal axis <b>416</b> with the coupler <b>422</b>. A spring <b>430</b> may be disposed between one end <b>432</b> of the bolt <b>418</b> and an interior surface <b>434</b> of the coupler <b>422</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, so that the bolt <b>418</b> may be biased outward from the coupler <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The driver <b>424</b> may be connected to the coupler <b>422</b> via a pin <b>436</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the pin <b>436</b> may extend from one outer surface of the coupler <b>422</b>, through a slot <b>438</b> in the driver <b>424</b>, and to the opposite outer surface of the coupler <b>422</b>. This configuration allows the driver <b>424</b> to move a limited distance, i.e., the length of the slot <b>438</b>, relative to the coupler <b>422</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>416</b>. As shown, a spring <b>440</b> may be disposed between one end <b>442</b> of the driver <b>424</b> and the end <b>432</b> of the bolt <b>418</b>, so that the driver <b>424</b> may be biased away from the bolt <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The handle <b>402</b> may be connected to the driver <b>424</b> via a pin <b>444</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. As shown, the handle <b>402</b> receives the driver <b>424</b> in an opening <b>446</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in the stem portion <b>408</b> of the handle <b>402</b> such that at least a portion of the driver <b>424</b> is contained within the handle <b>402</b> after assembly. The pin <b>444</b> may extend through the driver <b>424</b> and be received by a slot <b>448</b> in the stem portion <b>408</b> of the handle <b>402</b> so that the handle <b>402</b> may move relative to the driver <b>424</b>, as discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each solenoid <b>414</b> includes a coil <b>450</b>, a plunger <b>452</b>, and a spring <b>454</b>. The spring <b>454</b> biases the plunger <b>452</b> outward from the coil <b>450</b>. When the coil <b>450</b> is energized, which will be discussed in further detail below, the plunger <b>452</b> overcomes the bias of the spring <b>454</b> and retracts into the coil <b>450</b>. As described above, each solenoid <b>414</b> is placed in the case shell <b>412</b>. A casing <b>456</b> may be used to cover the solenoids <b>414</b> and a substantial portion of the case shell <b>412</b>. The casing <b>456</b> may be a single piece, or may be a plurality of pieces, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A plurality of fasteners <b>460</b> may be used to connect the casing <b>456</b> to the case shell <b>412</b>. As shown in the Figures, a strain relief device <b>461</b> may be positioned between one of the fasteners <b>460</b> and the casing <b>456</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each plunger <b>452</b> is configured to engage a solenoid engaging portion <b>458</b> in the stem portion <b>408</b> of the handle <b>402</b>, thereby locking the handle <b>402</b> in a locked position relative to the case shell <b>412</b>. The solenoid engaging portion may be a recess, or an opening. The illustrated embodiment is not intended to be limiting in any way. When the coils <b>450</b> are initially energized, the plungers <b>452</b> may not be able to retract into the coils <b>450</b> because of a shear force that is present between the plungers <b>452</b> and the stem portion <b>408</b> of the handle <b>402</b>, due to the biasing force of the spring <b>440</b> on the driver <b>424</b> and handle <b>402</b>. Pushing the handle <b>402</b> against the bias of the spring <b>440</b> relieves the shear force, thereby allowing the plungers <b>452</b> to retract into the coils <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once the plungers <b>452</b> have disengaged from the solenoid engaging portions <b>458</b>, the hand engaging portion <b>410</b> of the handle <b>402</b> may be grasped by the user and pulled outward and away from the case shell <b>412</b> so that the user may then more easily rotate the handle <b>402</b>, thereby causing rotation of driver <b>424</b>, the coupler <b>422</b>, and the bolt <b>418</b>. The handle <b>402</b> may be rotated until the bolt <b>418</b> unscrews from the remainder of the vending machine. Once the bolt <b>418</b> has been unscrewed, the door of the vending machine may be opened. To relock the vending machine, the user may close the door, grasp the handle <b>402</b>, rotate the handle <b>402</b> so that the bolt <b>418</b> reengages the matching threads in the machine and secure the door in a closed position. When the bolt <b>418</b> is fully reengaged, the solenoid engaging portions <b>458</b> in the stem portion <b>408</b> of the handle realign with the plungers <b>452</b> of the solenoids <b>414</b> that are no longer energized. The biasing force of the springs <b>454</b> on the plungers <b>452</b> move the plungers <b>452</b> to engage the solenoid engaging portions <b>458</b>, thereby locking the handle <b>402</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment, the solenoids <b>414</b> may be energized upon an appropriate signal received from a wireless micro-circuit <b>462</b>. The micro-circuit <b>462</b> may be attached to the case shell <b>412</b> with an adhesive <b>464</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, or with any other appropriate connector. The micro-circuit <b>462</b> has a wireless signal receiver that is configured to energize the solenoids when it receives a predetermined wireless signal to which it is programmed to receive from a remote control transmitter device that can be carried by service personnel, i.e. the aforementioned “user.’</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an embodiment, the micro-circuit <b>462</b> maintains the solenoids <b>414</b> in an energized state for a predetermined period of time, such as 8-15 second, and more preferably 10 seconds. As a result, if within this predetermined period of time the user does not apply the manual force to the handle <b>402</b> to relieve the shear force between the plungers <b>452</b> and the solenoid engaging portions <b>458</b> in the stem portion <b>408</b> of the handle <b>402</b>, the user will not subsequently be able to manually release the bolt <b>418</b> unless the solenoids are re-energized again. This ensures that the lock assembly <b>400</b> will relock in a short period of time, even if the user accidentally energized the solenoids <b>414</b>. Many of the tamper resistant attributes described above may also be used in the lock assembly <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>.</p>
