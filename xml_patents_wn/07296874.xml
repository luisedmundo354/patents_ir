<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) on Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-306881 filed on Aug. 29, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an inkjet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A serial inkjet recording apparatus which incorporate a nozzle head having nozzles has conventionally been known wherein ink is ejected from the nozzles while the nozzle head is moved in the width direction of a recording medium, whereby recording on the recording medium is performed (see, for example, the publication of Japanese Patent No. 2875636). An inkjet recording apparatus which incorporates a line head having nozzles arranged to cover the entire width of a recording medium in view of higher recording rate has conventionally been known wherein recording is performed without moving the head. (For example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-52910.)</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the inkjet recording apparatuses, ink remaining on a nozzle surface is sometimes condensed because of evaporation of moisture to have high concentration and high viscosity. In other cases, dust, or the like, is adhered on the nozzle surface. Accordingly, the nozzle surface is contaminated during continuous recording by ink ejection. Thus, in the inkjet recording apparatuses, it is necessary to periodically clean the nozzle surface. For example, a recording apparatus disclosed in the publication of Japanese Patent No. 2875636 has a blade for wiping the nozzle surface and an absorber attached to the nozzle surface for absorbing ink adhered on the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ink (including the dust, or the like) remaining on the nozzle surface can be collected by wiping the nozzle surface with the blade. However, the remaining ink is sometimes squeezed into nozzles by the wiping operation. Especially, the recording apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.10-52910 has an elongated line head, and therefore, a large amount of remaining ink is collected by wiping the nozzle surface with the blade in the longitudinal direction. Accordingly, the possibility that the remaining ink is squeezed into the nozzles increases.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was conceived in view of the above problems. An objective of the present invention is to surely clean a nozzle surface of an inkjet recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention is an apparatus for ejecting ink through nozzles onto a recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The recording apparatus comprises: a nozzle head including a nozzle surface in which two or more nozzles are provided; and an absorber which abuts the nozzle surface to absorb ink adhered on the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A portion of the absorber which corresponds to openings of the nozzles is removed such that the absorber abuts the nozzle surface except for a region near the nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this structure including the absorber, ink adhered on the nozzle surface of the nozzle head is absorbed by the absorber. Thus, the blade does not collect a large amount of remaining ink when it wipes the nozzle surface. Therefore, squeeze of the remaining ink into the nozzles is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A portion of the absorber which corresponds to the openings of the nozzles is removed, such that the absorber abuts the nozzle surface except for a region near the nozzles. If the absorber should abut an opening of a nozzle, the absorber would absorb ink inside the nozzle head. However, according to the present invention, the absorber does not abut an opening of a nozzle, and therefore, such absorption of ink inside the nozzle head is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention comprises: a nozzle head including a nozzle surface in which two or more nozzles are provided; a blade for wiping the nozzle surface; and an absorber which abuts the nozzle surface to absorb ink adhered on the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The absorber abuts the nozzle surface to absorb the ink before a wiping operation of the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this structure, ink adhered on the nozzle surface of the nozzle head is absorbed by the absorber before the blade wipes the nozzle surface. Thus, the blade does not collect a large amount of remaining ink when it wipes the nozzle surface. Therefore, squeeze of the remaining ink into the nozzles is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention comprises: a line head including two or more nozzle heads arranged along the width direction of the recording medium, each of the nozzle heads having a nozzle surface in which two or more nozzles are provided; a blade for wiping the nozzle surface; and an absorber which surrounds the nozzle heads of the line head.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a line head including a plurality of nozzle heads arranged side by side, ink remains in a gap between adjacent nozzle heads. The ink is sometimes condensed to have high concentration and high viscosity and sticks to the blade again. In this case, if the blade onto which the remaining ink has stuck is used in a wiping operation, the nozzle surface can be contaminated the remaining ink, or the remaining ink can be squeezed into the nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the inkjet recording apparatus having the above structure of the present invention, the remaining ink is absorbed by the absorber which surrounds each nozzle head. With this feature, contamination of the nozzle surface and squeeze of the remaining ink into the nozzles are prevented.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">(General Structure of Recording Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An inkjet head recording apparatus of this embodiment ejects ink droplets from an inkjet head onto a recording medium by utilizing the piezoelectric effect of a piezoelectric actuator, thereby performing recording on the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The recording apparatus A has four inkjet heads <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The four inkjet heads <b>11</b> include the inkjet head <b>11</b> for ejecting black ink, the inkjet head <b>11</b> for ejecting yellow ink, the inkjet head <b>11</b> for ejecting magenta ink and the inkjet head <b>11</b> for ejecting cyan ink. The recording apparatus A is capable of color printing with four colors of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A recording medium <b>12</b> is transferred under the inkjet heads <b>11</b> in a predetermined transfer direction (X direction) by a plurality of rollers <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The recording medium <b>12</b> may be provided in the form of a roll of paper (not shown) such that paper (recording medium <b>12</b>) is fed from the roll.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each inkjet head <b>11</b> extends in the width direction (Y direction) of the recording medium <b>12</b>. The four inkjet heads <b>11</b> are arranged along X direction in parallel to each other with predetermined intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each inkjet head <b>11</b> has a line head <b>4</b> which extends in Y direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>. The line head <b>4</b> has a plurality of nozzles <b>44</b> for ejecting ink and a plurality of piezoelectric actuators (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>) for expelling the ink from the nozzles <b>44</b>. The nozzles <b>44</b> are distributed over the entire width of the recording medium <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, each inkjet head <b>11</b> has the nozzles <b>44</b> distributed over the entire width of the recording medium <b>12</b>. Thus, in a recording operation, ink is ejected from predetermined nozzles <b>44</b> at predetermined timings while the recording medium <b>12</b> is transferred in the transfer direction. That is, a desired image can be formed on the recording medium <b>12</b> over the entire width thereof (e.g., JIS: A2 width) without moving the inkjet heads <b>11</b> along the width direction of the recording medium <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The recording apparatus A includes four purge units <b>5</b> for cleaning the line heads <b>4</b> of the inkjet heads <b>11</b>. These purge units <b>5</b> are placed at external positions which deviate in Y direction from the transfer position of the recording medium <b>12</b>. The plurality of purge units <b>5</b> are installed along X direction in parallel to each other with predetermined intervals so as to correspond to the inkjet heads <b>11</b>. Details of the structure of the purge units <b>5</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each inkjet head <b>11</b> is supported by a ball screw <b>16</b> and a linear guide <b>17</b> which extend in Y direction. The ball screw <b>16</b> is rotated by a motor <b>18</b> which is attached to an end of the ball screw <b>16</b>. The motor <b>18</b> rotates the ball screw <b>16</b>, whereby the inkjet head <b>11</b> reciprocates along Y direction while being guided by the ball screw <b>16</b> and the linear guide <b>17</b>. In this way, each inkjet head <b>11</b> moves between a recording position which is the transfer position of the recording medium <b>12</b> and a cleaning position which is the position where the purge unit <b>5</b> is provided. The four ball screws <b>16</b> are rotated by separate motors <b>18</b>. Thus, each of the four inkjet heads <b>11</b> is capable of independently moving between the recording position and the cleaning position.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Each inkjet head <b>11</b> is supported by the linear guide <b>17</b> and the ball screw <b>16</b> through a first rotation stage <b>11</b><i>a </i>which rotates around Z axis (extending in the vertical direction) and a second rotation stage <b>11</b><i>b </i>which rotates around X axis. The first rotation stage <b>11</b><i>a </i>adjusts the inclination of the line head <b>4</b> with respect to the width direction of the recording medium <b>12</b>. The second rotation stage <b>11</b><i>b </i>adjusts the inclination of a line head bottom surface (nozzle surface) with respect to the recording surface of the recording medium <b>12</b>. Since each line head <b>4</b> has an elongated shape, the distance between the nozzle surface and the recording medium changes due to the inclination of the line head <b>4</b> with respect to the surface of the recording medium <b>12</b>. As a result, ink falls on a displaced position. Further, since a plurality of line heads <b>4</b> which eject different colors of inks are provided in parallel to each other along the transfer direction of the recording medium <b>12</b>, a positional displacement is caused between the heads with respect to the recording medium <b>12</b>, and as a result, color misalignment is caused. In view of such, the inclination of each line head <b>4</b> with respect to the recording medium <b>12</b> is adjusted by the first and second rotation stages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. With such a feature, an ink droplet falls onto a desired position over the recording medium <b>12</b>, while displacement of the positions of ink droplets among a plurality of inkjet heads <b>11</b> is prevented. As a result, the image quality is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The recording apparatus A has four ink tanks <b>13</b>. The four ink tanks <b>13</b> include the ink tank <b>13</b> for containing black ink, the ink tank <b>13</b> for containing yellow ink, the ink tank <b>13</b> for containing magenta ink and the ink tank <b>13</b> for containing cyan ink. The four inkjet heads <b>11</b> and the four ink tanks <b>13</b> are connected on a one-to-one basis through ink tubes <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Ink contained in the ink tanks <b>13</b> are supplied to the inkjet heads <b>11</b> through the ink tubes <b>13</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The recording apparatus A has a power control box <b>14</b>. The inkjet heads <b>11</b> and the power control box <b>14</b> are connected through transmission lines <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The power control box <b>14</b> supplies electric power and a control signal to each inkjet head <b>11</b>. The power control box <b>14</b> also supplies a control signal to each motor <b>18</b> attached to an end of the ball screw <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The recording apparatus A has an air supply <b>15</b>. The inkjet heads <b>11</b> and the air supply <b>15</b> are connected through air tubes <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The air supply <b>15</b> supplies dry air to the inkjet heads <b>11</b>. Supply of the dry air increases the lifespan of a piezoelectric actuator, i.e., the period that a piezoelectric actuator (piezoelectric element) normally operates, as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The ink tubes <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the transmission lines <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the air tubes <b>15</b><i>a </i>are fixed by a fixing element at an intermediate position and tied in a bundle before being connected to the inkjet heads <b>11</b>. With such a structure, interference between the reciprocating inkjet heads <b>11</b> and the tubes and transmission lines is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">(Structure of Inkjet Head)</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each inkjet head <b>11</b> includes a main box <b>2</b> and a head box <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The main box <b>2</b> includes a circuit section <b>21</b> at the upper side and an ink section <b>22</b> at the lower side. The circuit section <b>21</b> incorporates a circuit board. The ink section <b>22</b> incorporates ink tubes, etc. The main box <b>2</b> has a rectangular parallelepiped shape, a part of which is cut away.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The head box <b>3</b> includes a line head <b>4</b> and a cover <b>31</b> for covering the line head <b>4</b>. The head box <b>3</b> has a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape. The head box <b>3</b> is fitted into the cut-away space of the main box <b>2</b>, such that the entire inkjet head <b>11</b> has a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The line head <b>4</b> includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a plurality of head bases <b>41</b> and a base plate <b>42</b> for holding the head bases <b>41</b>. Each head base <b>41</b> incorporates a nozzle head <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The head base <b>41</b> is provided with a driver board <b>45</b> and a sub tank <b>46</b> attached thereto. The driver board <b>45</b> supplies a driving waveform to the nozzle head <b>6</b>. The sub tank <b>46</b> contains ink.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The base plate <b>42</b> is made of an elongated plate material and has an opening <b>42</b><i>a </i>in the center thereof. The opening <b>42</b><i>a </i>is elongated in the longitudinal direction of the base plate <b>42</b> and has corrugated edges. The head bases <b>41</b> are fixed to the base plate <b>42</b> with an inclination from the longitudinal direction of the base plate <b>42</b> so as to fit with the corrugated edges. It should be noted that a plurality of head bases <b>41</b> (30 head bases <b>41</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are provided in the base plate <b>42</b> along the longitudinal direction of the base plate <b>42</b> although only one head base <b>41</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Each head base <b>41</b> has a nozzle plate <b>43</b> in which a plurality of nozzles <b>44</b> are arranged generally in a staggered pattern. Since a plurality of head bases <b>41</b> are arranged along the longitudinal direction of the base plate <b>42</b> in parallel to each other, the nozzles <b>44</b> are arranged with generally-equal intervals over the entire width of the recording medium <b>12</b> along the width direction of the recording medium <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>; Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> some of the nozzles <b>44</b> are not shown. In an actual case, one nozzle plate <b>43</b> has, for example, 400 nozzles <b>44</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The nozzle head <b>6</b> incorporated in the head base <b>41</b> ejects ink due to the piezoelectric effect of the piezoelectric actuator as described above. The nozzle head <b>6</b> has a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The nozzle head <b>6</b> has a head main body <b>61</b> in which a plurality of concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>for pressure rooms are formed. The concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>correspond to the nozzles <b>44</b> formed in the nozzle plate <b>43</b> and are arranged in parallel to each other along a row of the nozzles <b>44</b>. Each concaved portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>has a supply hole <b>61</b><i>b </i>for supplying ink to the concaved portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>and an ejection hole <b>61</b><i>c </i>for ejecting the ink from the concaved portion <b>61</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A side wall of each concaved portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>is formed by a pressure room member <b>62</b>. An ink passage member <b>63</b> is adhesively fixed onto the lower surface of the pressure room member <b>62</b>. A bottom wall of the concaved portion <b>61</b><i>a </i>is formed by the ink passage member <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The ink passage member <b>63</b> is a laminate of a plurality of thin plates. The ink passage member <b>63</b> has one ink supply passage <b>64</b>, a plurality of ink ejection passages <b>65</b>, and a plurality of orifices <b>66</b>. Each of the orifices <b>66</b> is connected to the supply hole <b>61</b><i>b </i>of a corresponding one of the concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a</i>. The ink supply passage <b>64</b> extends along the direction in which the concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>are arranged (the direction of a row of the nozzles <b>44</b>) and is connected to the orifices <b>66</b>. The ink supply passage <b>64</b> is connected to the sub tank <b>46</b>, from which ink is supplied to the ink supply passage <b>64</b>. Each of the ink ejection passages <b>65</b> is connected to the ejection hole <b>61</b><i>c </i>of a corresponding one of the concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The nozzle plate <b>43</b> is adhesively fixed onto the lower surface of the ink passage member <b>63</b>. The nozzles <b>44</b> formed in the nozzle plate <b>43</b> are connected to the ink ejection passages <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The piezoelectric actuators <b>67</b> are provided above the concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the head main body <b>61</b>. Each of the piezoelectric actuators <b>67</b> has a diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>made of Cr. The diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>is adhesively fixed onto the upper surface of the head main body <b>61</b> so as to cover the concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the head main body <b>61</b>, such that the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>and the concaved portions <b>61</b><i>a </i>form pressure rooms <b>68</b>. The diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>is made of a single member which is commonly used for all of the actuators <b>67</b>. The diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>also functions as a common electrode which is commonly used among all of piezoelectric elements <b>67</b><i>b </i>(described later).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Each piezoelectric actuator <b>67</b> has a piezoelectric element <b>67</b><i>b </i>made of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and an individual electrode <b>67</b><i>c </i>made of Pt. On a surface of the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>which is opposite to the pressure room <b>68</b> (i.e., the upper surface of the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a</i>), an intermediate layer <b>67</b><i>d </i>made of Cu is provided at a portion of the surface which corresponds to the pressure room <b>68</b> (a portion above the opening of the concaved portion <b>61</b><i>a</i>), and the piezoelectric element <b>67</b><i>b </i>is provided on the intermediate layer <b>67</b><i>d</i>.

Each individual electrode <b>67</b><i>c </i>functions together with the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>to apply a voltage (driving voltage) to a corresponding one of the piezoelectric elements <b>67</b><i>b</i>. It should be noted that all of the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a</i>, the piezoelectric elements <b>67</b><i>b</i>, the individual electrodes <b>67</b><i>c </i>and the intermediate layers <b>67</b><i>d </i>are formed of thin films.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Each piezoelectric actuator <b>67</b> applies a driving voltage to the piezoelectric element <b>67</b><i>b </i>through the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>and the individual electrode <b>67</b><i>c</i>, thereby deforming a portion of the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>which corresponds to the pressure room <b>68</b> (a portion of the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a </i>at the opening of the concaved portion <b>61</b><i>a</i>). As a result of the deformation of the diaphragm <b>67</b><i>a</i>, the ink in the pressure room <b>68</b> is ejected from the nozzle <b>44</b> through the ejection hole <b>61</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Since the piezoelectric actuators <b>67</b> correspond to the nozzles <b>44</b>, one head base <b>41</b> incorporates a plurality of piezoelectric actuators <b>67</b>.

Although only one relaying board <b>47</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, there are two relaying boards <b>47</b> provided in an actual device.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The main box <b>2</b> includes a main board <b>81</b> having a connector <b>84</b> in the circuit section <b>21</b>. The main board <b>81</b> includes a control board <b>82</b>, a D/A converter board <b>83</b> and an amplifier board <b>7</b>. The control board <b>82</b> includes an optical conversion board <b>82</b><i>a </i>which receives a light signal from the power control box <b>14</b> to output a head control signal and a piezoelectric board <b>82</b><i>a </i>for outputting head driving waveform data. The D/A converter board <b>83</b> D/A-converts the head driving waveform data. The amplifier board <b>7</b> amplifies the head driving waveform data. The connector <b>84</b> of the main board <b>81</b> is coupled to the connector <b>47</b><i>a </i>of the head box <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows circuit components necessary for one nozzle head <b>6</b> (including a plurality of piezoelectric actuators <b>67</b>). The head driving waveform data output from the control board <b>82</b> is input to an operational amplifier <b>71</b> of the amplifier circuit <b>7</b> through the D/A converter <b>83</b> and amplified by the operational amplifier <b>71</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an example of driving voltage and current waveforms of the nozzle head <b>6</b>. In the inkjet head <b>11</b> of this embodiment, the voltage waveform of high voltage (V<sub>0</sub>: generally 30 V or higher) and high slew rate (ΔV/Δt: in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, V<sub>0</sub>/Δt) is necessary in view of the ejection characteristics of ink. Thus, the operational amplifier <b>71</b> used in the amplifier circuit <b>7</b> has to achieve a high voltage and a high slew rate. Therefore, there are only a limited number of types of such amplifiers. For example, a large CAN-type operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> or a vertically mounted operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>b </i>of a resin mold type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Each piezoelectric actuator <b>67</b> of the nozzle head <b>6</b> functions as a capacitor.

To this end, a current buffer (emitter follower type) which includes pnp-type and npn-type transistors <b>72</b> is connected to the operational amplifier <b>71</b>. The electric current is amplified by this current buffer, and a head driving waveform is input to the driver circuit. The heat value of the transistors <b>72</b> which constitute the current buffer is relatively large, and therefore, a large heat sink <b>73</b> is necessary for cooling the transistors <b>72</b>. The power supplies (+V<b>1</b>, −V<b>2</b>, +V<b>3</b>, −V<b>4</b>) connected to the operational amplifier <b>71</b> or the current buffer may be provided inside the main box <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the power supplies may be provided outside the main box <b>2</b>.

Accordingly, sets of the large operational amplifier <b>71</b> and the current buffer including a large heat sink have to be mounted on one amplifier board <b>7</b> as much as the number of the nozzle heads <b>6</b> connected to the relaying board <b>47</b>. As a result, the size (area) of the amplifier board <b>7</b> disadvantageously increases.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In view of the above, this embodiment achieves reduction in the size (area) of the amplifier board <b>7</b> by employing the structure described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> illustrate a board arrangement of the amplifier board <b>7</b> where a CAN-type operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>is employed. It should be noted that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, illustration of electrolytic capacitors, connectors, etc., which are to be mounted on the amplifier board <b>7</b>, is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the case where a large number of large operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>and large heat sinks <b>73</b> are mounted on a substrate, the increase in size (area) of the substrate cannot be avoided. Thus, according to this embodiment, the operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the heat sinks <b>73</b> are vertically stacked on when they are mounted on the substrate. Specifically, a large number of operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>(15 amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) are arranged over the amplifier board <b>7</b>. At this step, the operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a</i>, each of which has a rhombic shape, are arranged such that the long diagonal line has an angle with the row direction. With such an arrangement, the arrangement efficiency is high as compared with a case where the operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>are arranged such that the long diagonal line is in parallel to the row direction. Thus, the area of the amplifier board <b>7</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The heat sink <b>73</b> has a cut-away recess <b>73</b><i>a </i>at the lower end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The heat sink <b>73</b> is provided over the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>such that the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>is placed in the recess <b>73</b><i>a</i>. With such a structure, interference between the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the heat sink <b>73</b> is avoided.

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As described above, the large operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the large heat sink <b>73</b> are vertically stacked, whereby the size (area) of the amplifier board <b>7</b> is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">(Variation <b>1</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows an amplifier board <b>7</b> of variation <b>1</b>. The amplifier board of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is the same as the amplifier board of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> in that an operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>and a heat sink <b>73</b> are vertically stacked. However, the amplifier board <b>7</b> of variation <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) is different from the amplifier board of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> in that the heat sink <b>73</b> does not have a recess <b>73</b><i>a</i>. In the amplifier board <b>7</b> of variation <b>1</b>, the heat sink <b>73</b> is fixed to the board <b>7</b> through spacers <b>74</b> provided at both sides of the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a</i>. (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the spacer <b>74</b> provided at one side of the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>a </i>is only shown, while illustration of the spacer <b>74</b> provided at the other side is omitted.) In variation <b>1</b>, the heat sink <b>73</b> is indirectly fixed to the amplifier board <b>7</b>, whereas the heat sink <b>73</b> is directly fixed to the amplifier board <b>7</b> in the case where the heat sink <b>73</b> has a recess <b>73</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the heat sink <b>73</b> having a recess <b>73</b><i>a </i>is preferable in view of the stability of fixation of the heat sink <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">(Variation <b>2</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> show an amplifier board <b>7</b> of variation <b>2</b>. In this example, CAN-type operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>are mounted on sub boards <b>75</b> which are different from the amplifier board <b>7</b>, and the sub boards <b>75</b> are vertically distributed over the amplifier board <b>7</b>. With such a structure, the operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the heat sinks <b>73</b> are arranged in parallel to each other along a horizontal direction. Since the operational amplifiers <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the heat sinks <b>73</b> are arranged in parallel to each other along a horizontal direction, the thickness of the heat sinks <b>73</b> has to be adjusted. Each heat sink <b>73</b> has an elongated shape and is common among a plurality of current buffers (transistors <b>72</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Every one of the current buffers may be provided with one heat sink <b>73</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">(Variation <b>3</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As described above, a possible candidate of the operational amplifier <b>71</b> other than the CAN-type amplifier is a resin mold type operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. This operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>b </i>is of vertical mount type and has a relatively large heat value. Thus, a heat sink <b>76</b> is necessary. In this case, if the heat sink <b>73</b> of the transistor <b>72</b> and the heat sink <b>76</b> of the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>b </i>are separately provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, the heat sink <b>73</b> and the heat sink <b>76</b> cannot be placed in the vicinity of each other because of fixation of the legs of the heat sinks <b>73</b> and <b>76</b> on the board. Thus, this arrangement is disadvantageous as to the installation space. In addition, the number of legs of the heat sinks <b>73</b> and <b>76</b> increases, and therefore, this structure is disadvantageous as to routing of the board pattern. In view of such, the heat sinks <b>73</b> of the transistors <b>72</b> and the heat sink <b>76</b> of the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>b </i>may be integrated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. With such a structure, it is possible to adjacently position the transistors <b>72</b> and the operational amplifier <b>71</b><i>b </i>in the vicinity of each other, and such an arrangement is advantageous in reduction of the size of the amplifier board <b>7</b>. In addition, the number of the legs of the heat sink <b>76</b> is reduced, whereby this structure is also advantageous as to routing of the board pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">(Fuse Blow Detection Circuit)</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a collector of each of the transistors <b>72</b> which constitute a current buffer has a fuse <b>72</b><i>a </i>for opening a circuit on the occurrence of an overcurrent. The amplifier board <b>7</b> has an output detection circuit <b>85</b> for detecting an output from the amplifier board <b>7</b> to the driver circuit <b>45</b>. A result of the detection is fed back to the control circuit <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As described above, in the case where the number of actuators to be driven is small (i.e., in the case where the number of nozzles from which ink is ejected is small), a required current value is small. Further, the operational amplifier <b>71</b> can provide an output if it has a small current value. Thus, in an emitter follower type current buffer, a head driving waveform is output to the driver circuit <b>45</b> through a base of the transistor <b>72</b> when the current value is small even if the fuse <b>72</b><i>a </i>is open. As a result, a fuse blow cannot be detected even when the output detection circuit <b>85</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In view of such, a fuse blow detection circuit <b>86</b> for detecting a fuse blow in the transistor <b>72</b> is provided separately from the output detection circuit <b>85</b>. A result of the detection is input to the control circuit <b>82</b>. With such a structure, a fuse blow is surely detected even when the number of nozzles that eject ink is small.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">(Structure of Purge Unit)</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In an inkjet recording apparatus, ink remaining on an ink ejection surface of the nozzle plate <b>43</b> (hereinafter, referred to as “nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>”) is condensed because of evaporation of moisture to have high concentration and high viscosity. Accordingly, there is a possibility that the condensed ink causes clogging of the nozzles <b>44</b> or contamination of the recording medium <b>12</b>. Thus, it is necessary to periodically clean the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, and to this end, a general inkjet recording apparatus has a cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As described above, the recording apparatus of this embodiment includes four purge units <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). These purge units <b>5</b> are provided at cleaning positions (external positions which deviate from the transfer position of the recording medium <b>12</b> in Y direction orthogonal to the transfer direction of the recording medium <b>12</b>) with predetermined equal intervals along the transfer direction (X direction) of the recording medium <b>12</b>. That is, the four purge units <b>5</b> are positioned according to the arrangement of the four inkjet heads <b>11</b>. The purge units <b>5</b> are provided at a level lower than the inkjet heads <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, each purge unit <b>5</b> has a frame <b>51</b> extending in Y direction, a plurality of caps <b>52</b> supported by the frame <b>51</b>, and a suction pump (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The caps <b>52</b> correspond to the nozzle plates <b>43</b> included in the inkjet heads <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>) and are arranged along Y direction. It should be noted that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> (and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>), some of the caps <b>52</b> included in the purge unit <b>5</b> (the nozzle plates <b>43</b> included in inkjet heads) are not shown, so that the number of caps <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is not equal to the number of caps <b>52</b> (and the number of nozzle plates <b>43</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this way, the caps <b>52</b> are provided to correspond to the nozzle plates <b>43</b>, whereby the size of the caps <b>52</b> is decreased. As a result, each cap <b>52</b> is readily brought into close contact with the nozzle surface. (As will be described later, pressure leakage rarely occurs when the inside of the cap <b>52</b> is decompressed.)</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Each cap <b>52</b> has a box-like shape with the upper face opened. The cap <b>52</b> has a through hole <b>52</b><i>a </i>which penetrates the bottom of the cap <b>52</b>. The through hole <b>52</b><i>a </i>of each cap <b>52</b> is connected to the suction pump.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Each purge unit <b>5</b> is supported and vertically moved by a linear actuator <b>53</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. With this structure, the state of the purge unit <b>5</b> alternately changes between the cleaning state where each cap <b>52</b> is in close contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the inkjet head <b>11</b> at the cleaning position and the retreat state where the cap <b>52</b> is physically separate from the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The linear actuator <b>53</b> is supported by a fine adjustment stage <b>54</b> and a rotation stage <b>55</b> which are vertically stacked. The fine adjustment stage <b>54</b> moves by a minuscule distance along the X-axis direction. The rotation stage <b>55</b> rotates around the Z-axis. With this structure, the purge unit <b>5</b> is movable by a minuscule distance along the X-axis direction and is rotatable around the Z-axis. As described above, the inclination of each inkjet head <b>11</b> with respect to the recording medium <b>12</b> is adjusted by the first and second rotation stages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The fine adjustment stage <b>54</b> and the rotation stage <b>55</b> adjust the position and inclination of the purge unit <b>5</b> according to the adjusted inclination of the inkjet head <b>11</b>. With such a structure, when the purge unit <b>5</b> is in the cleaning state, the upper opening of each cap <b>52</b> of the purge unit <b>5</b> is in close contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of a corresponding inkjet head <b>11</b>, whereby the cleaning operation is surely performed.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The purge unit <b>5</b> has a wiping member <b>56</b> for wiping the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>in a longitudinal direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 25</figref>. In the example described herein, the wiping member <b>56</b> is a blade made of an elastic material. The blade <b>56</b> is provided to stand upright at a longitudinal end of the frame which is closer to the recording medium <b>12</b>. When the purge unit <b>5</b> is lifted (but not up to a level where the cap <b>52</b> abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>), a tip of the blade <b>56</b> abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. The inkjet head <b>11</b> is moved relatively to the purge unit <b>5</b> while the blade <b>56</b> abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, whereby the blade <b>56</b> wipes the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>in a longitudinal direction to remove ink adhered on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. Ink remaining around a nozzle is removed by suction while the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cap <b>52</b> before the blade <b>56</b> wipes the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Since the inkjet head <b>11</b> (line head <b>4</b>) has an elongated shape, a large amount of ink is recovered by wiping the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>with the blade <b>56</b>. Thus, there is a possibility that the ink recovered by the blade <b>56</b> is squeezed into the nozzles <b>44</b> by the wiping operation of the blade <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In view of the above possibility, the purge unit <b>5</b> has an absorber <b>57</b> for absorbing ink adhered on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>. This absorber <b>57</b> is supported by the frame <b>51</b> and provided to surround the cap <b>52</b>. In other words, a portion of the absorber <b>57</b> which corresponds to the opening of the nozzle <b>44</b> is removed, and the cap <b>52</b> is provided at the portion from which the absorber <b>57</b> has been removed. When the purge unit <b>5</b> is in the cleaning state where the cap <b>52</b> is in close contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, the absorber <b>57</b> abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. With such a structure, the absorber <b>57</b> absorbs ink adhered on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>(except for a portion covered with the cap <b>52</b>) before the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is wiped with the blade <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The absorber <b>57</b> may be any material capable of absorbing ink. For example, the absorber <b>57</b> may be a porous member.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Next, the cleaning operation of the purge unit <b>5</b> for cleaning the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. If the inkjet head <b>11</b> is moved to the cleaning position (step P<b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>), the purge unit <b>5</b> is then lifted up by the linear actuator <b>53</b>, such that the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cap <b>52</b> (step P<b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). Then, suction means (not shown) is activated while the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cap <b>52</b>. As a result, the inside of the closed cap <b>52</b> results in a negative pressure state, so that ink adhered in the vicinity of the opening of the nozzle <b>44</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">At the above step, the absorber <b>57</b> provided around the cap <b>52</b> abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, so that ink adhered on a portion of the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>which is not covered with the cap <b>52</b> is absorbed by the absorber <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">After the ink adhered on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>has been removed by using the cap <b>52</b>, the suction means, and the absorber <b>57</b>, the purge unit <b>5</b> is lowered by the linear actuator <b>53</b> by a predetermined height (step P<b>23</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). With this state, the inkjet head <b>11</b> is moved to a recording position (step P<b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>), whereby the tip of the blade <b>56</b> wipes the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>in a longitudinal direction. Thus, cleaning of the inkjet head <b>11</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The purge unit <b>5</b> of the recording apparatus A is provided at an external position of the recording medium <b>12</b> in a width direction (Y direction) and extends along Y direction along with a corresponding one of the inkjet heads <b>11</b>. The recording apparatus A moves each inkjet head <b>11</b> along the longitudinal direction between a recording position and a cleaning position. With this structure, the size of the recording apparatus A in the transfer direction of the recording medium <b>12</b> (X direction) is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Each of the four inkjet heads <b>11</b> can independently moved between the recording position and the cleaning position as described above. For example, it is possible that some of the four inkjet heads <b>11</b> which need cleaning are moved to the cleaning position to be cleaned whereas the other inkjet heads <b>11</b> remain at the recording position. Alternatively, it is possible that the four inkjet heads <b>11</b> are sequentially cleaned such that a first-cleaned inkjet head <b>11</b> is moved back to the recording position for test printing on the recording medium <b>12</b> while the subsequent inkjet heads <b>11</b> are being cleaned. Thus, the time required for cleaning is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The absorber <b>57</b> is provided around the cap <b>52</b> and therefore does not abut the nozzle <b>44</b> even if the purge unit <b>5</b> is in the cleaning state. If the absorber <b>57</b> should abut the nozzle <b>44</b>, the absorber <b>57</b> would absorb ink inside the nozzle head. Thus, the absorption function of absorbing remaining ink adhered on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>can be impaired. In view of such, according to the present invention, the absorber <b>57</b> is prevented from abutting the nozzle <b>44</b>, such that the absorber <b>57</b> does not absorb the ink inside the head. Thus, the absorber <b>57</b> surely absorbs the ink adhered on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The absorbers <b>57</b> may retreat back into gaps between the nozzle plates <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> when the purge unit <b>5</b> is brought into close contact with the inkjet head <b>11</b>. For example, the absorber <b>57</b> may be supported by the frame <b>51</b> such that the surface of the absorber <b>57</b> is flush with, or extends ahead of, the upper end of the cap <b>52</b>. With such a structure, ink remaining in the gaps between the nozzle plates <b>43</b> is efficiently absorbed by the absorber <b>57</b>. As a result, contamination of the recording medium <b>12</b>, etc., is surely prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a plurality of caps <b>52</b> are provided to the nozzle plates <b>43</b> included in the inkjet head <b>11</b> on a one-to-one manner, but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, one elongated cap may be provided to cover all of the nozzle plates <b>43</b>. In this case, it is difficult to bring the entire circumference of the elongated cap into close contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. Thus, it is necessary to adopt a measure for surely removing ink in order to enhance the suction capacity of the suction means.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">(Other Examples of Absorber)</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">[First Alternative Example]</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">If the absorber <b>57</b> abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>such that the entire surface of the absorber <b>57</b> comes in contact with a large area of the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>at one time, the absorber <b>57</b> cannot entirely absorb the ink remaining on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, and ink left unabsorbed can be spread over the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. In view of such, the absorber <b>57</b> may be structured such that a surface region of the absorber <b>57</b> which abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>changes with the lapse of time. Herein, the change of the surface region includes an example where a surface region that abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>prior to the other region is detached away from the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>when the other region comes in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>and an example where a surface region that abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>prior to the other region is kept in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>when the other region comes in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Specifically, a surface of the absorber <b>57</b> (a surface which abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>) may have convexities and concavities. With this structure, when the purge unit <b>5</b> is lifted up, the convexities abut the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>prior to the concavities, and then, the concavities abut the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. In this example, the convexities are kept in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>even when the concavities come in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. Even when the absorber <b>57</b> has an undulated surface, the above effects are achieved. Alternatively, the absorber <b>57</b> may have an arch-like surface where a longitudinal center portion is bulkier than both ends of the arch. In this case, when the purge unit <b>5</b> is lifted up, the center portion of the absorber <b>57</b> first abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, and thereafter, the both ends abut the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">[Second Alternative Example]</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the absorber <b>57</b> may have a cylindrical shape, which is attached around the external surface of a cylinder <b>58</b>. This cylindrical absorber <b>57</b> is provided such that the cylinder shaft of the cylindrical absorber <b>57</b> extends in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. The cylindrical absorber <b>57</b> has a height generally equal to that of the blade <b>56</b> and is provided behind the blade <b>56</b> with respect to the travel direction of the inkjet head <b>11</b> (the travel direction taken when the inkjet head <b>11</b> moves from the cleaning position to the recording position).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">After suction of ink with the cap <b>52</b> and the suction means has been completed, at steps P<b>23</b> and P<b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the cylindrical absorber <b>57</b> is rotated around the cylinder shaft in synchronization with the travel of the inkjet head <b>11</b> while the cylindrical absorber <b>57</b> is kept in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>(the position of the cylindrical absorber <b>57</b> is not moved). In this case, a surface region of the absorber <b>57</b> which first comes in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is detached from the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>when another surface region comes in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. That is, the absorber <b>57</b> abuts (comes in contact with) the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>elongated in the longitudinal direction such that the surface region of the absorber <b>57</b> which is in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>gradually changes in a perimeter direction (i.e., along the rotation direction), thereby absorbing ink adhered on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. In this structure, the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>abuts the blade <b>56</b> after abutting the absorber <b>57</b>. Thus, a series of cleaning operations are realized such that the nozzle surface is wiped with the blade <b>56</b> after ink has been absorbed by the absorber <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Since the absorber <b>57</b> is attached over the external surface of the cylinder <b>58</b>, the absorber <b>57</b> has a belt-like shape when developed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>. As described above, the absorber <b>57</b> preferably has openings <b>57</b><i>a </i>at the portions that can abut the nozzles <b>44</b> in order to prevent ink inside the nozzle head from being absorbed. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, one nozzle plate <b>43</b> has two rows of nozzles <b>44</b>, and an opening <b>57</b><i>a </i>is formed for each row of nozzles <b>44</b>. With this structure, ink adhered on a region between the rows of nozzles <b>44</b> is absorbed by the absorber <b>57</b>. Alternatively, the absorber <b>57</b> may have openings <b>57</b><i>b </i>which correspond to respective one of the nozzle plates <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In the example where the absorber <b>57</b> is attached onto the external surface of the cylinder <b>58</b>, the size of the absorber <b>57</b> is small as compared with the case where the absorber <b>57</b> is attached to the frame <b>51</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). Even if a line head <b>4</b> having a different length is employed (even if the number of the head bases <b>41</b> attached to the base plate <b>42</b> is changed to construct a recording apparatus that complies with a recording medium <b>12</b> having a different width), the same absorber <b>57</b> can also be employed in this recording apparatus. Thus, the same element (absorber) can be commonly used for different types of recording apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Alternatively, the cylinder <b>58</b> onto which the absorber <b>57</b> is attached is formed of a porous material, and a suction pump <b>59</b> may be provided in the hollow inside of the cylinder <b>58</b> at the central portion thereof. With this structure, ink absorbed by the absorber <b>57</b> is collected by the suction pump <b>59</b>. The cylindrical absorber <b>57</b> has a relatively small volume as described above and therefore can be saturated with ink. With the suction pump <b>59</b> for sucking up the ink absorbed by the absorber <b>57</b>, stable ink absorption is realized. It should be noted that the suction pump <b>59</b> is applicable to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> where the absorber <b>57</b> is supported by the frame <b>51</b>. In this case, the suction pump <b>59</b> is connected to a portion of the absorber <b>57</b> other than the surface thereof (the surface which abuts the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The suction pump <b>59</b> may be activated during the time when the absorber <b>57</b> which is in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is absorbing ink. With such an operation, ink absorbed by the absorber <b>57</b> is sucked by the suction pump <b>59</b> at all times, whereby ink dripping is effectively prevented when the absorber <b>57</b> is detached from the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively, the suction pump <b>59</b> may be activated during the time when the absorber <b>57</b> is away from the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>so as not to absorb ink.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The length of the absorber <b>57</b> along the cylinder axis direction (width Ls) is preferably shorter than the length of the blade <b>56</b> (width Lb) (Ls&lt;Lb). With such a structure, even if ink is spread in width directions over the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>at the time when the absorber <b>57</b> comes in contact with the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a</i>, the ink spread in the width directions and left unabsorbed by the absorber <b>57</b> is surely wiped away by the blade <b>56</b> that is wider than the absorber <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">[Third Alternative Example]</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Although in each of the above examples the absorber <b>57</b> is provided in the purge unit <b>5</b>, an absorber <b>9</b> may be provided in the line head <b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the case where a large number of nozzle heads <b>6</b> are arranged side by side to form a line head <b>4</b> as in this embodiment, ink sometimes remains at edges of each nozzle plate <b>43</b> after the blade <b>56</b> has wiped the nozzle surface in the longitudinal direction (the remaining ink is condensed because of evaporation of moisture to have high concentration and high viscosity). There is a possibility that the remaining ink causes contamination of the recording medium <b>12</b> and that the remaining ink is squeezed into the nozzles <b>44</b> when the blade <b>56</b> wipes the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>again.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In view of such, the absorber <b>9</b> is provided on the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>to surround the nozzle plate <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. With such a structure, ink remaining after the blade <b>56</b> has wiped the nozzle surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is absorbed by the absorber <b>9</b>. Thus, contamination of the recording medium <b>12</b> and clogging of the nozzles <b>44</b> are prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Preferably, the absorber <b>9</b> is flush with or retreats behind the surface of the nozzle plates <b>43</b>. Further, the absorber <b>9</b> may be provided in the gaps between the nozzle plates <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>. Alternatively, especially when the gaps between the nozzle plates <b>43</b> are very narrow, it is not necessary to provide the absorber <b>9</b> in the gaps as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>. It should be noted that, in the case where the absorber <b>9</b> is provided in the gaps between the nozzle plates <b>43</b>, ink remaining at the edges of the nozzle plates <b>43</b> is efficiently absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">It should be noted that absorbers may be provided in both the purge unit <b>5</b> and the line head <b>4</b> or may be provided in any one of the purge unit <b>5</b> and the line head <b>4</b>.</p>
