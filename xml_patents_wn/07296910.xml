<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to light fixtures for illuminating architectural spaces. The invention has particular application in light fixtures using fluorescent lamps, such as the T5 linear fluorescent lamp, as the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous light fixtures for architectural lighting applications are known. In the case of fixtures that provide direct lighting, the source of illumination may be visible in its entirety through an output aperture of the light fixture or shielded by elements such as parabolic baffles or lenses. A light fixture presently used in a typical office environment comprises a troffer with at least one fluorescent lamp and a lens having prismatic elements for distributing the light. Also known are light fixtures that use parabolic reflectors to provide a desired light distribution. The choice of light fixture will depend on the objectives of the lighting designer for a particular application and the economic resources available. To meet his or her design objectives, the lighting designer, when choosing a light fixture, will normally consider a variety of factors including aesthetic appearance, desired light distribution characteristics, efficiency, lumen package, maintenance and sources of brightness that can detract from visual comfort and productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An important factor in the design of light fixtures for a particular application is the light source. The fluorescent lamp has long been the light source of choice among lighting designers in many commercial applications, particularly for indoor office lighting. For many years the most common fluorescent lamps for use in indoor lighting have been the linear T8 (1 inch diameter) and the T12 (1½ inch diameter). More recently, however, smaller diameter fluorescent lamps have become available, which provide a high lumen output from a comparatively small lamp envelope. An example is the linear T5 (⅝ inch diameter) lamp manufactured by Osram/Sylvania and others. The T5 has a number of advantages over the T8 and T12, including the design of light fixtures that provide a high lumen output with fewer lamps, which reduces lamp disposal requirements and has the potential for reducing overall costs. The smaller-diameter T5 lamps also permit the design of smaller light fixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some conventional fluorescent lamps, however, have the significant drawback in that the lamp surface is bright when compared to a lamp of larger diameter. For example, a conventional T5 lamp can have a surface brightness in the range of 5,000 to 8,000 footlamberts (FL), whereas the surface brightness of the larger T8 and T12 lamps generally is about 3,000 FL and 2,000 FL, respectively (although there are some versions of linear T8 and T12 lamps with higher brightness). The consequence of such bright surfaces is quite severe in applications where the lamps may be viewed directly. Without adequate shielding, fixtures employing such lamps are very uncomfortable and produce direct and reflected glare that impairs the comfort of the lighting environment. Heretofore, opaque shielding has been devised to cover or substantially surround a fluorescent lamp to mitigate problems associated with light sources of high surface brightness; however, such shielding defeats the advantages of a fluorescent lamp in regions of distribution where the lamp's surfaces are not directly viewed or do not set up reflected glare patterns. Thus, with conventional shielding designs, the distribution efficiencies and high lumen output advantages of the fluorescent lamp can be substantially lost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further disadvantage to traditional parabolic and prismatic troffers is the presence of distracting dynamic changes in brightness level and pattern as seen by a moving observer in the architectural space. Additionally, traditional parabolic and prismatic troffers allow direct or only slightly obscured views of the lamp source(s)) at certain viewing angles (low angles for both the parabolic and prismatic and most transverse angle for prismatic). This unaesthetic condition is remedied by indirect and direct-indirect fixture designs, but typically with a significant loss of efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another known solution to the problem of direct glare associated with the use of high brightness fluorescent lamps is the use of biax lamps in direct-indirect light fixtures. This approach uses high brightness lamps only for the uplight component of the light fixture while using T-8 lamps with less bright surfaces for the light fixture's down-light component. However, such design approaches have the drawback that the extra lamps impair the designer's ability to achieve a desired light distribution from a given physical envelope and impose added burdens on lamp maintenance providers who must stock and handle two different types of lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Conventional parabolic light fixture designs have several negative features. One of these is reduced lighting efficiency. Another is the so-called “cave effect,” where the upper portions of walls in the illuminated area are dark. In addition, the light distribution of these fixtures often creates a defined line on the walls between the higher lit and less lit areas. This creates the perception of a ceiling that is lower than it actually is. Further, when viewed directly at high viewing angles, a conventional parabolic fixture can appear very dim or, even, off.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention overcomes the above-described disadvantages of light fixtures using brighter light sources by providing a configuration that appears to a viewer as though it has a source of lower brightness, but which otherwise permits the light fixture to advantageously and efficiently distribute light generated by the selected lamp, such as the exemplified T5 lamp. The light fixture of the present invention reduces distracting direct glare associated with high brightness light sources used in direct or direct-indirect light fixtures. This reduction in glare is accomplished without the addition of lamps and the added costs associated therewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention relates to a light fixture, or troffer, for efficiently distributing light emitted by a light source into an area to be illuminated. In one general aspect of the invention, the light fixture includes a reflector assembly that supports the light source. The light fixture may also include a lens assembly positioned with respect to a portion of the reflector assembly to receive light emitted by the light source and distribute it such that glare is further reduced. In a preferred embodiment, the lens assembly receives and distributes substantially all of the light emitted by the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect, the reflector assembly of the light fixture includes a base member that extends longitudinally between spaced edges along a longitudinal axis. At least a portion of the base member can form a reflective surface, which is preferably a curved reflective surface. In one aspect, the reflector assembly supports the light source such that the longitudinal axis of the light source is substantially parallel to that of the base member. The light source is preferably supported in a recessed portion of the reflector assembly whereby high angle glare in directions transverse to the longitudinal axis of the light fixture is blocked by the lower side edges of the light fixture. The light source can be a conventional lamp, such as, for example, a T5 lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, the lens assembly includes a lens that has a first end edge, an opposed second end edge, and a central lens portion that extends longitudinally between the first and second end edges. In one aspect, the lens has a lens longitudinal axis that is generally parallel to the light source longitudinal axis. The central portion of the lens has a prismatic surface that defines a face that can be oriented toward or away from the light source. In one aspect, the central lens portion is curved and can have a concave, convex, or planar shape in cross-section. In an alternative aspect, the lens assembly may include a diffuser inlay that is positioned in substantially overlying registration with a portion of the face of the central lens portion that faces the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the prismatic surface of the central lens portion is concave relative to the light source. At least a portion of the prismatic surface defines an array of contiguous and parallel prismatic elements. In one example, each prismatic element extends generally longitudinally and substantially between the first and second edges of the lens. In one example, the prismatic elements each have a curved surface that subtends an angle, in a transverse vertical plane, of about and between 80° to 120° with respect to their center of curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The lens is preferably detachably secured to a portion of the reflector assembly in overlying registration with the light source. In one aspect, a portion of the reflector assembly and a portion of the lens substantially enclose the light source so that, to an external viewer, the light source is substantially hidden from view. In one example, the array of linear extending prismatic elements presents to the external viewer an array of spaced, longitudinally extending shadows, or dark stripes, on the lens. Thus, the lens assembly of the present invention provides an aesthetically more pleasing appearance as well as efficiently distributing the light generated by the light source onto portions of the reflective surfaces of the reflector assembly and onto the desired area to be illuminated.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The lens assembly and reflector assembly of the present invention increase the light efficiency of the light fixture and diffuse the light relatively uniformly, which minimizes the “cave effect” commonly noted in areas using conventional parabolic light fixtures in the ceiling. In one embodiment, the light fixture or troffer of the present invention results in a luminare efficiency that is greater than 80%, preferably.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present invention is more particularly described in the following exemplary embodiments that are intended as illustrative only since numerous modifications and variations therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As used herein, “a,” “an,” or “the” can mean one or more, depending upon the context in which it is used. The preferred embodiments are now described with reference to the figures, in which like reference characters indicate like parts throughout the several views.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Ranges may be expressed herein as from “about” one particular value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a light fixture <b>10</b> or troffer of the present invention for illuminating an area includes a reflector assembly <b>20</b> for housing a linear light source <b>12</b>. The light source extends along a light longitudinal axis between a first end <b>14</b> of the light source and a spaced second end <b>16</b> thereof. Light emanating from the light source <b>12</b> is diffused by a lens assembly <b>100</b> that is positioned between the light source <b>12</b> and the area to be illuminated. The light source <b>12</b> may be a conventional fluorescent lamp, and in one aspect, the light source <b>12</b> can be a conventional T5 lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reflector assembly <b>20</b> of the light fixture includes an elongated base member <b>22</b> that has a first end edge <b>24</b>, a spaced second end edge <b>26</b>, a first longitudinally extending side edge <b>28</b> and an opposed second longitudinally extending side edge <b>29</b>. The base member <b>22</b> further has a base surface <b>30</b> extending along a base longitudinal axis. The base member can be formed from a single piece of material or from a plurality of adjoined pieces. As one will appreciate, the reflector assembly can be formed from any code-compliant material. For example, the base member can be formed from steel.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A portion of the base surface <b>30</b> of the base member <b>22</b> forms at least one longitudinally extending hollow <b>32</b> that extends inwardly in the transverse dimension with respect to and away from the respective first and second longitudinally extending side edges. Each hollow <b>32</b> has a first hollow edge <b>34</b> and a second hollow edge <b>36</b> and extends inwardly toward a central portion <b>38</b> defined by and between the respective first and second hollow edges <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. The central portion defines a longitudinally extending trough <b>40</b> that extends inwardly away from the surface of the hollow <b>32</b>. At least a portion of each hollow <b>32</b> preferably forms a reflective surface <b>33</b> extending between central portion <b>38</b> and a respective one of the first and second hollow edges <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. In one embodiment, at least a portion of a section of each hollow <b>32</b> normal to the base longitudinal axis has a generally curved shape such that such that portions of the hollow <b>32</b> form a generally curved reflective surface <b>35</b> for diffusely reflecting light received from the lens into the architectural space in a desired pattern. In one embodiment, the transverse section of the hollow can have a conventional barrel shape. In an alternative embodiment, a portion of each hollow <b>32</b> can have at least one planar portion.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one aspect, at least a portion of the hollow of the base surface <b>30</b> of the base member can be painted or coated with a reflective material or formed from a reflective material. The reflective material may be substantially glossy or substantially flat. In one example, the reflective material is preferably matte white to diffusely reflect incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The central portion <b>38</b> of the light fixture is preferably symmetrically positioned with respect to the first and second hollow edges <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. The light fixture <b>10</b> of the present invention can include one or more hollows <b>32</b> that each houses a light source <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, in a light fixture having a single hollow, the first and second hollow edges <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> of the hollow would extend generally to the respective longitudinally extending side edges <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> of the base member <b>22</b>. In an alternative example, in which the light fixture <b>10</b> has two hollows, the base member <b>22</b> defines a pair of adjoining, parallel hollows. Here, a first hollow edge <b>34</b> of a first hollow <b>32</b>″ extends generally to the first side edge <b>28</b> of the base member, and a second hollow edge <b>36</b> of a second hollow <b>32</b>′ of the pair of hollows extends generally to the second side edge <b>29</b> of the base member. The second hollow edge <b>36</b> of the first hollow <b>32</b>′ and the first hollow edge <b>34</b> of the second hollow <b>32</b>″ are adjoined in one example. Alternatively, the second hollow edge <b>36</b> of the first hollow <b>32</b>′ and the first hollow edge <b>34</b> of the second hollow <b>32</b>″ are positioned proximate or near each other.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one aspect, at least a portion of the base surface <b>30</b> of the base member <b>22</b>, preferably at least a portion of the reflective surface <b>33</b> thereof, has a plurality of male ridges <b>37</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B-5C</figref>, formed thereon that extend longitudinally between the ends of the base member. In an alternative aspect, at least a portion of the base surface <b>30</b> of the base member, preferably at least a portion of the reflective surface <b>33</b> thereof, has a plurality of female grooves <b>39</b> formed thereon that extend longitudinally between the ends of the base member. Alternatively, the ridges or grooves extend at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the base member. For example, the male ridges or female grooves may extend transversely with respect to the base longitudinal axis (i.e., extending between the respective first and second longitudinally extending side edges <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> of the base member). In another aspect, each male ridge or female groove <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> can extend substantially parallel to an adjoining male ridge or female groove. The ridges <b>37</b> or grooves <b>39</b> formed on the hollow <b>32</b> provide a diffusely reflecting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The trough <b>40</b> is formed by a top surface <b>42</b>, a first side trough surface <b>44</b> and an opposed second side trough surface <b>46</b> is provided for receiving the elongated light source <b>12</b>. The trough extends along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the light fixture. Each respective first and second side trough surface has a lower edge <b>48</b> that is integral with a portion of the adjoined hollow <b>32</b>. In one example, the lower edges of the first and the second trough surfaces are integral with the reflective surfaces <b>33</b> of the adjoined hollow. Each respective first and second side trough surface defines a trough surface axis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) that extends in a vertical plane normal to the base longitudinal axis of the base member.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one aspect, the trough surface axis of each of the first and second trough surfaces <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> respectively forms an angle θ of about and between about 140° to 90° with respect to the top surface <b>42</b> of the trough. More particularly, the angle θ can be about and between about 135° to 95° with respect to the top surface of the trough. Still more particularly, the angle θ can be about and between about 130° to 100° with respect to the top surface of the trough. In another aspect, the angle θ formed between each of the respective first and second trough surfaces and the top surface of the trough can be substantially equal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one aspect of the invention, the light source <b>12</b> can be positioned between the base surface of the base member and the lens assembly. In another aspect of the invention, the light source <b>12</b> can be positioned within the trough <b>40</b> of the reflector assembly <b>20</b> such that the light longitudinal axis is positioned above a plane that extends between the lower edges <b>48</b> of the respective first and second trough surfaces. Alternatively, the light source <b>12</b> can be positioned within the trough of the reflector assembly such that the light source is positioned substantially about or above an arcuate section that extends between the lower edges <b>48</b> of the respective first and second trough surfaces <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and is an arcuate continuation of the curvature of the curved reflective surfaces <b>35</b> of the hollow. In this aspect, the radius of the arcuate section can have substantially the same radius as the curved portion of the hollow. If the curved reflective surfaces of the hollow are parabolic, the arcuate section is a parabolic extension of the parabolas of the curved reflective surface.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The reflector assembly <b>20</b> can also include a first end face <b>50</b> and an opposed second end face <b>52</b>. Each of the end faces extends upwardly away from a respective bottom edge <b>54</b> toward a top edge <b>55</b> of the light fixture. Each end face has a face longitudinal axis that forms an obtuse angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the base member <b>22</b>. In one aspect, the end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are positioned with respect to the base member such that a portion of the top edge <b>55</b> of the end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> is positioned in substantial overlying registration with portions of the base surface <b>30</b>. It is contemplated that at least a portion of the top edge <b>55</b> can contact at least a portion of the base surface <b>30</b>. In another aspect, at least a portion of the top edge <b>55</b> is spaced inwardly from the end edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the base member. The angled first and second end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> optically alter the apparent perspective of the light fixture and aesthetically give the light fixture a deeper appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one aspect, the face longitudinal axis of each of the first and second end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> respectively forms an angle Ω of about and between 95° to 160° with respect to the base longitudinal axis of the base member <b>22</b>. More particularly, the face longitudinal axis of each of the first and second end faces respectively forms an angle Ω of about and between 100° to 150° with respect to the base longitudinal axis. Still more particularly, the face longitudinal axis of each of the first and second end faces respectively forms an angle Ω of about and between 100° to 135° with respect to the base longitudinal axis. In another aspect, the face longitudinal axis of each of the first and second end faces respectively forms an angle Ω of about 120° with respect to the base longitudinal axis. In yet another aspect, the respective obtuse angles formed between the face longitudinal axis of the first end face <b>50</b> and between the face longitudinal axis of the second end face <b>52</b> and the base longitudinal axis of the base member <b>22</b> are substantially equal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternative shapes of the first and second end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are contemplated. Each of the first and second end faces may be substantially planar or non-planar. In the non-planar embodiments, portions of the first and second end faces are curved. The curved portions of the first and second end faces can be substantially concave or substantially convex. Portions of the first and second end faces can also have male ridges or female grooves formed thereon. The male ridges or female grooves can be sized, shaped and oriented to visually complement the male ridges or female grooves on the base member <b>22</b>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The light fixture <b>10</b> of the present invention also includes a housing <b>60</b> having a first end wall <b>62</b> and a second end wall <b>64</b>. In one aspect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first end wall <b>62</b> is connected to a portion of the first end edge <b>24</b> of the base member <b>22</b> and the second end wall is connected to a portion of the second end edge <b>26</b> of the base member <b>22</b>. In this aspect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a portion of the a bottom edge <b>54</b> of the first end face <b>50</b> can be connected to a bottom portion <b>63</b> of the first end wall <b>62</b> of the housing and a portion of bottom edge <b>54</b> of the second end face <b>52</b> is also connected to a bottom portion <b>63</b> of the second end wall <b>64</b> of the housing. In one example, the first end wall <b>62</b> and the first end face <b>50</b> can be formed integral to each other. Similarly, the second end wall <b>64</b> and the second end face <b>52</b> can be formed integral to each other. The first end wall <b>62</b> can be positioned substantially perpendicular to the base member <b>22</b> adjacent the first end edge of the base member. Similarly, the second end wall <b>64</b> can be positioned substantially perpendicular to the base member <b>22</b> adjacent the second end edge of the base member.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one aspect, an opening <b>56</b> is defined in each of the first and second end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, which opening <b>56</b> is constructed and arranged to receive at least a portion of a selected end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the light source <b>12</b> therein. In this aspect, portions of the respective first and second end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, portions of the respective first and second end walls <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and portions of the base surface <b>30</b> together define a chamber <b>58</b> adjacent the respective top edges <b>55</b> the first and second end faces. The chamber <b>58</b> is in operative communication with the opening <b>56</b> in the respective first and second faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and is constructed and arranged to receive at least a portion of a selected end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the light source therein. The brighter conventional lamps, such as the exemplified T5 lamp, are typically shorter and have an elongated dark portion proximate their ends when compared to other conventional elongated fluorescent lamps, such as, for example, conventional T8 and T12 lamps. Thus, in use, the chambers prevent the darkened ends of the selected light source from being visible through the lens assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one aspect, each chamber <b>58</b> is constructed and arranged to mount an electrical contact <b>59</b> or receptacle for detachably securing a selected end of the light source thereto. In one example, the electrical contact <b>59</b> is mounted onto a portion of the base surface <b>30</b> of the base member <b>22</b> that partially defines the chamber <b>58</b>. It is contemplated that the electrical contact <b>59</b> can be mounted to any of the surfaces that define the chamber <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>, the housing of the light fixture can also include at least one angled cover <b>65</b>, which are exemplarily illustrated as being a pair of angled faces <b>65</b>′ and <b>65</b>″, respectively. In one aspect, each angled cover has a first panel <b>66</b> and a second panel <b>67</b> that are connected to each other along a common, angled edge <b>68</b>. Each first panel <b>66</b> has a first side edge <b>70</b> and each second panel <b>67</b> has a second side edge <b>72</b>. The first side edge <b>70</b> of the first panel <b>66</b> is connected to a portion of the first longitudinal side edge <b>28</b> of the base member <b>22</b>. The second side edge <b>72</b> of the second panel <b>67</b> is connected to a portion of the base top surface <b>31</b> of the base member <b>22</b>. In one example, the first panel <b>66</b> of the angled cover <b>65</b> is substantially perpendicular to the base member <b>22</b> adjacent the first longitudinally extending side edge <b>28</b> of the base member. In another example, the first and second panels <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> of the angled cover are substantially perpendicular to each other.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The light fixture <b>10</b> also includes at least one conventional light ballast <b>76</b> constructed and arranged for electrically connecting the light source to an external power source.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in one aspect, at least a portion of the first port <b>78</b>′ is defined in a portion of the second panel <b>67</b> of the first angled cover <b>65</b>′. In another aspect, at least a portion of the first port <b>78</b>′ is defined in a portion of the first panel <b>66</b> of the first angled cover <b>65</b>′. In this latter example, the defined portion of the first port <b>78</b>′ is spaced from the first side edge <b>70</b> of the first panel <b>66</b> of the first angled cover a predetermined distance. The predetermined distance is greater than the height of a conventional ceiling panel or tile that would typically abut the bottom portion of the light fixture. Because the predetermined distance is greater than the conventional height of a ceiling panel, the first closure plate <b>79</b>′ can therefore be removed without binding onto the abutting ceiling panel or ceiling support apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an alternative example, a portion of the first port <b>78</b>′ is defined in a portion of both the first and second panels <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The at least one angled cover <b>65</b>, as discussed above, can also include a second angled cover <b>65</b>″ (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this example, the first side edge <b>70</b> of the first panel <b>66</b> of the second angled cover <b>65</b>″ is connected to a portion of the second longitudinally extending side edge <b>29</b> of the base member <b>22</b> and the second side edge <b>72</b> of the second panel <b>67</b> of the second angled cover is connected to a portion of the base top surface <b>31</b> of the base member. Similar to the first angled cover, the second angled cover extends between the first end wall <b>62</b> and the second end wall <b>64</b> of the housing <b>60</b> such that portions of the first and second end walls <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, portions of the second angled cover <b>65</b>″, and portions of the base top surface <b>31</b> together define a second ballast enclosure <b>74</b>″. The second ballast enclosure can remain empty or a second ballast <b>76</b>″ can be positioned within the interior of the second ballast enclosure as the electrical demands of the use of the light fixture dictate.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Accordingly, and still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a portion of the second angled cover can define a second port <b>78</b>″ adjacent the angled edge <b>68</b> that is in communication with the second ballast enclosure <b>74</b>″.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one aspect, therefore, at least a portion of the second port <b>78</b>″ is defined in a portion of the first panel <b>66</b> of the second angled cover <b>65</b>″ and is spaced from the first side edge <b>70</b> of the first panel <b>66</b> the predetermined distance, as discussed above, for clearance from abutting ceiling panels.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an alternative embodiment, suitable for retrofit applications, the housing can be a pre-existing housing that, for example, is conventionally mounted in a ceiling. In this embodiment, the reflector assembly of the present invention is connected to the pre-existing housing. In one aspect, at least a portion of the base member defines an access port. A movable cover (not illustrated) is provided in or on the reflector assembly that can be opened and closed by an operator to access a ballast that is disposed in an interior cavity formed between the back of the reflector assembly and portions of the pre-existing housing.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an alternative embodiment, the light fixture is suspended from the ceiling. In this embodiment, the reflector assembly can be connected to a housing that defines an interior cavity sized to accept the electrical ballast therein. The housing is spaced from the ceiling a predetermined distance and is mounted to the ceiling via conventional suspension means. Alternatively, the ballast can be mounted onto a portion of the surface of the base member that is oriented toward the ceiling. Here, the base member is spaced from the ceiling a predetermined distance and is mounted to the ceiling via conventional mounting means.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As one will appreciate, it is contemplated that such a suspended light fixture could include one or of more hollows, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In a suspended light fixture having a single hollow, the respective first and second side edges of the hollow would extend to the edges of the base member. In an example having a pair of parallel hollows, the first hollow edge of the a first hollow extends to one side edge of the base member and the second hollow edge of the second hollow edge extends to the other side edge of the base member. In one aspect, the trough of the reflector assembly of the suspended light fixture is integral with a portion of an adjoined hollow. In another aspect, the reflector assembly of the suspended light fixture includes at least one end face that is positioned at an obtuse angle with respect to the base member of the top surface <b>31</b> of the reflector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> and <b>8</b>-<b>15</b>, the lens assembly <b>100</b> of the present invention is constructed and arranged to direct light emitted by the light source <b>12</b> onto the area to be illuminated. A basic function of the lens assembly <b>100</b> is to diffuse the light from the light source <b>12</b> to effectively hide the light source <b>12</b> itself from view while reducing its brightness. Thus, one function of the lens assembly is to effectively become the source of light for the light fixture. This is accomplished in the preferred embodiment by providing the lens <b>110</b> of the lens assembly with an array <b>120</b> of longitudinally extending prismatic elements <b>122</b> with short focal lengths. Because of the short focal lengths of the prismatic elements, the light from the light source is focused to parallel images very close to the surface of the lens at large angles of convergence. Because of the large angles of convergence, the images overlap and the light is essentially diffused. The diffused light is then either directed onto the surface to be illuminated without further reflection or is reflected by the reflective surfaces of the hollow <b>32</b>. Thus, the lens assembly provides a diffuse source of lowered brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As discussed above, the light source <b>12</b> is mounted in the trough and is recessed with respect to the side edges of the reflector assembly. This allows the lens <b>110</b> to be placed higher in the light fixture and provides geometric control of high-angle rays emanating from the lens in the transverse direction. Thus, light rays produced at high viewing angles are physically blocked by the bottom longitudinally extending side edges <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> of the light fixture, which prevents glare at high angles in that transverse direction. The light fixture of the invention controls glare in the longitudinal direction, however, optically.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">High angle glare is reduced in the longitudinal direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-21</figref> and as described below. Thus, in this aspect, the light fixture of the invention prevents glare at high viewing angles through two mechanisms, geometrically in the transverse direction and optically in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one aspect, the lens assembly <b>100</b> includes a lens <b>110</b> having a first end edge <b>112</b>, an opposed second end edge <b>113</b>, and a central lens portion <b>114</b> that extends between the first and second edges. The central lens portion <b>114</b> has a lens longitudinal axis that extends between the first and second end edges. In one example, the lens longitudinal axis is generally parallel to the light source longitudinal axis. In use, the lens <b>110</b> of the lens assembly is positioned with respect to the reflector assembly <b>20</b> of the light fixture such that substantially all of the light emitted by the light source <b>12</b> passes through the lens <b>110</b> prior to impacting portions of the reflective surfaces <b>33</b> of the reflector assembly and/or prior to being dispersed into the surrounding area.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The lens <b>110</b> can be made from any suitable, code-compliant material such as, for example, a polymer or plastic. For example, the lens <b>110</b> can be b constructed by extruding pellets of meth-acrylate or polycarbonates into the desired shape of the lens. The lens <b>110</b> can be of a clear material or a translucent material. In another aspect, the lens can be colored or tinted.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>, the central lens portion <b>114</b> of the lens has a prismatic surface <b>116</b> on a face <b>118</b> of the central lens portion that is either spaced from and facing toward the light source <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) or, alternatively, spaced from and facing away from the light source <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). In one aspect of the invention, the central lens portion <b>114</b> is curved in cross-section such that at least a portion of the face <b>118</b> of the central lens portion has a concave or convex shape relative to the light source. In an alternative embodiment, at least a portion of the central lens portion <b>114</b> is planar in cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one aspect, the lens <b>110</b> is positioned within the reflector assembly so that it is recessed above a substantially horizontal plane extending between the first and second longitudinally extending side edges <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> thereof. In a further aspect, the lens is recessed within the reflector assembly such that a plane bisecting one of the respective first and second longitudinally extending side edges and a tangential portion of the lens is oriented at an acute angle γ to the generally horizontal plane extending between the first and second longitudinally extending side edges <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>. In one aspect, the acute angle γ is about and between 3° to 30°. More particularly, the acute angle γ is about and between 05° to 20°. Still more particularly, the acute angle γ is about and between 10° to 15°.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The recessed position of the lens assembly within the reflector assembly provides for high angle control of light emitted by the light fixture in a vertical plane normal to the base longitudinal axis of the base member. In use, an observer approaching the ceiling mounted light fixture of the present invention from the side (i.e., from a direction transverse to the base longitudinal axis) would not see the lens assembly until they passed into the lower viewing angles. In effect, portions of the reflector assembly act to block the view of the lens assembly from an observer at the higher viewing angles (i.e., the viewing angles closer to the horizontal ceiling plane).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one aspect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-17</figref>, the prismatic surface <b>116</b> of the lens defines an array of linearly extending prismatic elements <b>120</b>. In one example, each prismatic element <b>122</b> of the array <b>120</b> can extend substantially longitudinally between the first and second edge and edges <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> of the lens. Alternatively, each prismatic element <b>122</b> of the array can extend linearly at an angle relative to the lens longitudinal axis. For example, each prismatic element thereof can extend generally transverse to the lens longitudinal axis. In a further aspect, each prismatic element <b>122</b> can have substantially the same shape or, alternatively, can vary in shape to cause differing visual effects on an external observer, lighting of the hollow surface, or light distribution to the room. In one aspect, each prismatic element has a portion that is rounded or has a curved surface.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one aspect, in section normal to the lens longitudinal axis, each prismatic element has a base <b>124</b> and a rounded apex <b>126</b>. Each prismatic element extends toward the apex <b>126</b> substantially perpendicular with respect to a tangent plane that extends through the base <b>124</b>. In one aspect, an arcuate section or curved surface <b>128</b>, normal to the lens longitudinal axis, of each prismatic element <b>122</b> subtends an angle β of about and between 85° to 130° with reference to the center of curvature of the arcuate section. More particularly, the arcuate section <b>128</b> of each prismatic element forms an angle β of about and between 90° to 120°. Still more particularly, the arcuate section <b>128</b> forms an angle β of about and between 95° to 110°. In another aspect, the arcuate section <b>128</b> forms an angle β of about 100°.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one aspect, the arcuate section <b>128</b> extends from a first cusp edge <b>130</b> of the prismatic element <b>122</b> to an opposed second cusp edge <b>132</b>. In this example, adjoining prismatic elements are integrally connected at a common cusp edge. Alternatively, the arcuate section <b>128</b> may be formed in a portion of the apex <b>126</b> of the prismatic element <b>122</b>, such that adjoining prismatic elements are integrally connected along the common edge <b>133</b>. In this example, portions of the prismatic element <b>122</b> extending between the arcuate section and the common edge <b>133</b> can be planar or non-planer, as desired. It should be understood that other configurations and shapes are contemplated where the cross section of the optical elements is not strictly circular, and include, for example, parabolic, linear, or other shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one aspect, the base <b>124</b> of each prismatic element <b>122</b> has a width (w) between its respective common edges of about and between 0.5 inches to 0.01 inches. More particularly, the base of each prismatic element has a width between its respective common edges of about and between 0.3 inches to 0.03 inches. Still more particularly, the base of each prismatic element has a width between its respective common edges of about and between 0.15 inches to 0.05 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another aspect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a section of the array of prismatic elements <b>120</b> has a shape of a continuous wave. The section can be normal to the lens longitudinal axis. In one aspect, the shape of the continuous wave is a periodic waveform that has an arcuate section <b>128</b> formed in both the positive and negative amplitude portions of the periodic waveform (i.e., two prismatic elements are formed from each single periodic waveform). The period of the periodic waveform can be substantially constant or may vary along the array of prismatic elements. In one aspect, the periodic waveform is a substantially sinusoidal waveform. In this example, the common cusp “edge” <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> between the two prismatic elements <b>122</b> forming from each periodic waveform occurs at the transition from positive/negative amplitude to negative/positive amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, therefore, the arcuate section <b>128</b> of each prismatic element <b>122</b> within each of the positive and negative amplitude portions of the periodic waveform subtends an angle λ of about and between 85° to 130° with reference to a center of curvature of the arcuate section. More particularly, the arcuate section <b>128</b> of each prismatic element within each of the positive and negative amplitude portions of the periodic waveform forms an angle λ of about and between 90° to 120°. Still more particularly, the arcuate section <b>128</b> of each prismatic element within each of the positive and negative amplitude portions of the periodic waveform forms an angle λ of about and between 95° to 110° with respect to the base longitudinal axis.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in one aspect, the period P of each prismatic element is about and between 1.0 inches to 0.02 inches.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The lens <b>110</b> of the light assembly <b>100</b> is constructed and arranged for detachable connection to the light fixture <b>10</b> or troffer. In one aspect, when positioned relative to the base member <b>22</b>, the central lens portion <b>114</b> of the lens assembly can extend generally parallel to the light source longitudinal axis and generally symmetric about a plane that extends through the light source longitudinal axis. In one other aspect, the plane of symmetry extends through the area desired to be illuminated. In one example, the lens <b>110</b> is constructed and arranged for detachable connection to a portion of the base surface <b>30</b> of the reflector assembly <b>20</b>. In one particular example, the lens <b>110</b> is constructed and arranged for detachable connection to a portion of the trough <b>20</b> defined in the base member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one aspect, the elongated lens <b>110</b> has a first arm <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) that is connected to a first lens edge <b>115</b> of the central lens portion <b>114</b> and a second arm <b>142</b> that is connected to a second lens edge <b>117</b> of the central lens portion <b>114</b>.

In use, the lens <b>110</b> may be removed from the reflector housing by applying force to the respective first and second lens edges <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> of the central lens portion <b>114</b>. The application of force causes the central lens portion <b>114</b> to bend and, resultantly, causes the respective end portions <b>144</b> of the first and second arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to move toward each other. Removal of the applied force allows the lens <b>110</b> to return toward its unstressed shape and allows the respective end portions <b>144</b> of the first and second arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> to move away from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one aspect, each of the first and second arms of the lens has a bottom portion <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) that is connected to the respective first and second lens edges <b>115</b>, <b>117</b> and extends toward the end portions <b>144</b> of the respective arms <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The lens assembly <b>100</b> can also include a conventional diffuser inlay <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), such as, for example, a OptiGrafix™ film product, which is a diffuser film that can be purchased from Grafix® Plastics. The diffuser inlay <b>150</b> can be pliable or fixed in shape, transparent, semi-translucent, translucent, and/or colored or tinted. In one example, the diffuser inlay <b>150</b> has relatively high transmission efficiency while also scattering a relatively high amount of incident light to angles that are nearly parallel to its surface. In one aspect, the diffuser inlay is positioned between a portion of the face <b>118</b> of the central lens portion and the light source <b>12</b>. In another aspect, the diffuser inlay is sized and shaped for positioning in substantial overlying registration with the portion of the face <b>118</b> of the central lens portion <b>114</b> that is oriented toward the light source <b>12</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-21</figref>, the lens assembly <b>100</b> and reflector assembly <b>20</b> of the present invention increase the light efficiency of the light fixture <b>10</b> and diffuse the light relatively uniformly so that the “cave effect” commonly noted in areas using conventional parabolic light fixtures in the ceiling are minimized. In one embodiment, the light fixture <b>15</b> or troffer of the present invention results in a luminare efficiency that is greater than about 80%, preferably greater than about 85%. The efficiency of the light fixture <b>10</b> measured by using a goniophotometer to compare the light energy from the light fixture at a given angle with the light from an unshielded light source, as specified in the application testing standard. The test results for an exemplary light fixture of the present invention and comparable results for a conventional parabolic light fixture are included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. The light fixture of the present invention has reduced light control relative to conventional parabolic fixtures to provide a lit space (particularly the walls) with a bright appearance while still maintaining adequate control and comfortable viewing for today's office environment.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The light fixture <b>10</b> of the present invention has a low height profile that allows for easy integration with other building systems and installations in low plenum spaces. In one aspect, the height profile of the light fixture is about or below 5 inches. More particularly, the height profile of the light fixture is about or below 4 inches. In another aspect, the height profile of the light fixture is about 3.25 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one embodiment of the lens assembly <b>100</b> discussed above, the central lens portion <b>114</b> of the lens <b>110</b> has a concave face <b>118</b> oriented toward the light source <b>12</b> when the lens <b>110</b> is detachably secured to and within a portion of the reflector assembly <b>20</b>. The array of male rounded prismatic elements <b>120</b> can be extruded along the length of the lens <b>110</b>. In use, the lens of the present invention design has a striped visual characteristic to an external observer when back lit. These “stripes” provide for visual interest in the lens <b>110</b> and may be sized and shaped to mirror any ridges or grooves disposed therein portions of the reflective surfaces <b>33</b> of the hollow <b>32</b> of the reflector assembly <b>20</b>. The “stripes” also help to mitigate the appearance of the image of the lamp (the light source) by providing strong linear boundaries that breakup and distract from the edges of the lamp against the less luminous trough <b>40</b> of the reflector assembly <b>20</b>. In addition, the “stripes” allow for the light fixture <b>10</b> of the present invention to provide high angle light control in vertical planes that are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the light fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In a preferred embodiment, a primary function of the lens is to optically reduce the brightness of the light source. In addition, the lens reduces the brightness of the light source even further at higher viewing angles in the longitudinal direction by the optical phenomenon of total internal reflection. This allows the efficient use of light sources of higher brightness while nevertheless reducing glare at high viewing angles.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It will be appreciated that the light fixture of the invention utilizes a unique combination of features to reduce high-angle glare in the transverse and longitudinal directions. In the transverse direction, high angle glare is controlled primarily by the geometric relationship between the lamp and the reflector assembly of the light fixture, as discussed above, while in the longitudinal direction, high angle glare is controlled primarily by the lens optically. In the preferred embodiment, the lens itself essentially becomes the light source, which effectively reduces lamp brightness in both the transverse and longitudinal directions optically, to further reduce glare associated with lamps of high brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-21</figref>, the optical creation of the dark “stripes” in the lens is illustrated. A “reverse ray,” “backward ray” or “vision ray” is a light ray that originates from a hypothetical external viewer's eye and is then traced through the optical system of the light fixture. Although there is no physical equivalent, it is a useful construct in predicting how a particular optical element will look to an observer. In the present invention, on at least one side at the respective common cusp edges <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b> of adjoining rounded prismatic elements <b>122</b>, there exists a sufficiently large angle of incidence ω relative to the normal extending from the point of incidence of the reverse ray at the lens to air interface that a reverse ray will undergo total internal reflection. In one aspect, the angle of incidence ω is at least about 40°. More particularly, the angle of incidence ω is at least about 45. Still more particularly, the angle of incidence ω is at least about 50°. In effect, the array of prismatic elements acts as an array of partial light pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Each rounded prismatic element <b>122</b> has a sufficiently large angular extent such that some total internal reflection at each common cusp edge is assured regardless of viewing angle. In one aspect, since each curved surface, or arcuate section, <b>128</b> of each rounded prismatic element <b>122</b> is substantially circular, if a reverse ray undergoes total internal reflection at one portion of the arcuate section and is subsequently reflected to another portion of the arcuate section, then total internal reflection will also occur at the second point of incidence because the arcuate section's geometry causes both interactions to have substantially the same angle of incidence. Generally then, a reverse ray that undergoes total internal reflection proximate a common cusp edge <b>133</b> will eventually exit the lens <b>110</b> out the same outer surface through which it entered the lens and will terminate on a surface or object in the room (as opposed to passing through the lens and terminating on the light source or the trough of the reflector assembly behind the lens). The reverse ray is said to be “rejected” by the lens. This means that the brightness an external viewer will perceive at the common cusp edge <b>133</b> of adjoining rounded prismatic elements <b>122</b> is the brightness associated with a room surface because any real/forward light ray impinging on the viewer's eyes from this part of the lens must have originated from the room or space. Generally, the brightness of an object or surface in the room is much lower than that of the light source or trough that is viewed through the central portions of the arcuate sections <b>128</b> of each prismatic element <b>122</b>. This high contrast in brightness between the common cusp edge <b>133</b> between adjoining rounded prismatic elements <b>122</b> and the central portion of the arcuate sections <b>128</b> of each prismatic element <b>122</b> is so high that it is perceived, to the external viewer, as dark stripes on a luminous background.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The linear array <b>120</b> of prismatic elements <b>122</b> of the lens <b>100</b> assembly optically acts in the longitudinal direction to reduce high angle glare. This may be explained by considering a reverse ray that is incident on a portion of the prismatic surface of the lens proximate the common cusp edge <b>133</b> at the critical angle (the minimum angle of incidence ω) for total internal reflection of the reverse ray. An observer viewing that portion of the lens (i.e., the portion of the area about the common cusp edge) would perceive it as being “dark” relative to that adjacent “bright” portion of the arcuate section proximate the rounded apex of each individual prismatic element. The array of linear elements thus optically controls the light emitted from the lamp in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one example, as the lens <b>110</b> is viewed at higher and higher viewing angles (as when the observer is further from the light fixture) in a vertical plane parallel or near parallel to the base longitudinal axis of the base member, the striping effect visible on the surface of the lens becomes more pronounced. This is a result of the increase in that portion of the prismatic surface of the lens that undergoes total internal reflection and creates the dark strips. This results from viewing the lens at angles greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection of a “reverse ray.” Thus, the effective width of each stripe grows as the lens is viewed at higher viewing angles, which is observed as the lens becoming dimmer at higher viewing angles.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the vertical planes extending between the base longitudinal axis of the reflector assembly base member and an axis transverse to the base member longitudinal axis, higher view angle control is achieved through a combination of the high angle control proffered by the linearly extending array of prismatic elements of the lens, as discussed immediately above, and the lens assembly being recessed within the reflector assembly. In the vertical plane substantially parallel to the base longitudinal axis of the reflector assembly, the optical elements of the lens assembly, i.e., the array of prismatic elements, exert primary glare control of the higher viewing angles. In the vertical plane substantially transverse to the base longitudinal axis of the reflector assembly, the recessed position of the lens assembly within the reflector assembly exerts primary glare control of the higher viewing angles.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one aspect, if the prismatic elements <b>122</b> are regularly spaced apart, the striping effect would also be regularly spaced. In another aspect, the prismatic elements <b>122</b> of the present invention can be sized and shaped to ensure some total internal reflection at all viewing angles so that the “striping” is perceptible at all viewing angles.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In use, normal movement of a viewer in the room does not change the viewer's vertical angle of view relative to the light fixture very rapidly and at far distances the stripes become less distinct. Therefore, the change is stripe width is not perceived as a dynamic motion but rather as a subtle changing of the overall lens brightness (i.e., brighter at low vertical angles and dimmer when viewed at high vertical angles).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The rounded or curved surface portions of each prismatic element <b>122</b> provide a wide spreading or diffusion of any incident light. The high degree of diffusion helps to obscure the image of the light source <b>12</b> as seen through the lens <b>110</b> even when the light source is in relatively close proximity to the face of the lens <b>110</b> that is oriented toward the light source. This becomes increasingly apparent as the lens is viewed at higher vertical angles in the vertical plane substantially parallel to the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another aspect, the rounded or curved surface portions of the prismatic elements <b>122</b> provide for a gradual change in the perceived brightness as a result of a change in the angle of view. In yet another aspect, in an embodiment of the invention in which each prismatic element <b>122</b> has substantially the same shape, the dark striping and the brighter areas of the lens <b>110</b> appear to change uniformly and smoothly from one prismatic element <b>122</b> to the next, adjoining prismatic element <b>122</b>.</p>
