<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional application of application Ser. No. 10/653,229, filed Sep. 3, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,073,251, issued on Jul. 11, 2006.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a disassembling tool for disassembling a process cartridge detachably attached to an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a laser beam printer or a facsimile apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an image forming apparatus using an electrophotographic image forming process, there is adopted a process cartridge comprising an electrophotographic photosensitive member and process means for acting on the electrophotographic photosensitive member integrally made into a cartridge which is made detachably attachable to an image forming apparatus main body. According to this process cartridge system, the maintenance of the image forming apparatus can be done by a user himself without resort to a serviceman and therefore, the usability of the image forming apparatus is markedly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As the construction of such a process cartridge, there is one in which two frame bodies are coupled together. For example, a photosensitive member frame body for supporting a photosensitive drum, a charging device and a cleaning device, and a developing device frame body comprising a developing frame body for supporting developing means and a toner frame body having a toner chamber, the developing frame body and the toner frame body being joined together, are coupled together for rotation about a fulcrum. The two frame bodies are biased about the aforementioned fulcrum by a resilient member such as a spring to thereby determine the relative position of the photosensitive drum and the developing means. The functional merits of adopting the above-described construction are that the pressure force of a developing roller against the photosensitive drum can be made proper, and that the interval between the surface of the photosensitive drum and the surface of the developing roller can be maintained constant. Further, the use of the aforedescribed two frame bodies leads to many merits such as the facilitation of the molding of the frame bodies and the facilitation of assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the above-described conventional process cartridge, an engagement pin bringing a developing device unit and a photosensitive member unit into engagement with each other is required to have sufficient withstanding pull-out strength to ensure the engagement between the two units. Also, the engagement pin is installed so as to be fully embedded in a holding portion so that the user may not pull out the engagement pin by mistake.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To disassemble the process cartridge, the engagement pin coupling the two units together is pulled out, and the process cartridge is disassembled into the developing device unit and the photosensitive member unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Some embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a process cartridge P to be disassembled by the use of a disassembling tool which is an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in the photosensitive member unit B of the process cartridge P, there are disposed a photosensitive drum <b>10</b> as an electrophotographic photosensitive member on which an electrostatic latent image is to be formed, a charging device <b>11</b> for uniformly charging the surface of the photosensitive layer of the photosensitive drum, and cleaning means <b>14</b> for scraping off any residual toner adhering onto the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> from the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b>, and storing it in a waste toner container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Also, in a developing device unit A, there are disposed a toner container <b>21</b> as process means containing a toner therein, a developing roller <b>20</b> as process means for supplying the toner to the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> to thereby form a visible image, and a developing blade <b>22</b> as process means for imparting triboelectrification charges to the toner to thereby form a toner layer on the surface of the developing roller <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Now, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> is rotated clockwise. A predetermined voltage is applied to the charging device <b>11</b>, and when the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> contacts the charging device <b>11</b>, the surface of the photosensitive layer of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> is uniformly charged. Then, a laser beam conforming to image information from an optical system <b>1</b> is applied onto the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> through an exposure opening portion <b>2</b> formed in a cleaning frame body <b>13</b> to thereby form an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>10</b>. Thereafter, a toner image is formed on the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> by developing means.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Here, the developing means feeds the toner in the toner container <b>21</b> to the developing roller <b>20</b> by the rotation of a toner feeding member <b>23</b>. The developing roller <b>20</b> containing a stationary magnet therein is then rotated. Then, a toner layer having triboelectrification charges imparted thereto by the developing blade <b>22</b> is formed on the surface of the developing roller <b>20</b>, and the toner is supplied to the developing area of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b>. The toner is shifted to the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> in conformity with the aforementioned electrostatic latent image to thereby form a toner image. Here, the developing blade <b>22</b> prescribes the amount of toner on the peripheral surface of the developing roller <b>20</b> and also imparts triboelectrification charges thereto. Also, a toner agitating member <b>24</b> for circulating the toner in a developing chamber is rotatably mounted near the developing roller <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A voltage opposite in polarity to the aforementioned toner image is applied to a transferring roller <b>3</b> provided in an image forming apparatus main body to thereby transfer the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> to a recording medium <b>4</b>. Thereafter, any residual toner on the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> is removed by the cleaning means <b>14</b>. The cleaning means <b>14</b> scrapes off the toner residual on the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> by an elastic cleaning blade <b>14</b><i>a </i>provided in abutting relationship with the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> and collects it into the waste toner container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a drum flange <b>36</b> is an integrally molded article having a drum gear <b>10</b><i>b</i>, a convex shaft <b>37</b> and a convex portion <b>37</b><i>a</i>, and is a driving force transmitting part having the function of transmitting a driving force. A concave portion <b>39</b> is provided on the image forming apparatus side to transmit the driving force to the convex portion <b>37</b><i>a</i>. A bearing <b>38</b> is of a concave shape in order to receive the concave portion <b>39</b> and to effect the positioning of the cartridge P when mounted on the image forming apparatus main body. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows the fixing of the bearing <b>38</b> to the cleaning frame body <b>13</b>, and there are formed concave portions <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>c</i>, in which screws <b>38</b><i>b </i>are inserted and fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref> show the coupling of the developing device unit A and the photosensitive member unit B.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The developing device unit A and the photosensitive member unit B are pivotally coupled together by a coupling pin <b>50</b> having a circular cross section to thereby constitute the cartridge P. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, circular pivot apertures <b>41</b> are formed parallel to the developing roller <b>20</b> at the tip ends of arm portions <b>19</b> formed on the opposite sides of a developing frame body <b>15</b> in the lengthwise direction thereof (the axial direction of the developing roller <b>20</b>). On the other hand, concave portions <b>33</b> for inserting the arm portions <b>19</b> thereinto are provided at two locations on the opposite sides of the cleaning frame body <b>13</b> in the lengthwise direction thereof. The arm portions <b>19</b> are inserted into these concave portions <b>33</b>, and the coupling pin <b>50</b> is forced into the outer supporting hole <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the cleaning frame body <b>13</b>. The coupling pin <b>50</b> is then fitted into the pivot aperture <b>41</b> at the end of the arm portion <b>19</b> and is further forced into an inner supporting hole <b>31</b><i>b </i>and is attached thereto, whereby the developing device unit A and the photosensitive member unit B are coupled together for pivotal movement about the coupling pin <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A mounting portion for the coupling pin <b>50</b> will now be described in detail. The arm portions <b>19</b> of the developing device unit A are inserted into the concave portions <b>33</b> between the inner side plate B<b>1</b> and the outer side plate B<b>2</b> of the photosensitive member unit B. Positioning is effected so that the outer supporting hole <b>31</b><i>a</i>, the inner supporting hole <b>31</b><i>b </i>and the pivot apertures <b>41</b> may be disposed substantially coaxially with one another. Thereafter, the coupling pin <b>50</b> is forced in from the outside of the outer side plate B<b>2</b> of the photosensitive member unit B. The outer diameter portion of the coupling pin <b>50</b>, the outer supporting hole <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the inner supporting hole <b>31</b><i>b </i>are in a tight fit relationship with one another, and the outer diameter portion of the coupling pin <b>50</b> and the pivot apertures <b>41</b> are in a loose fit relationship with each other. Consequently, after the coupling pin <b>50</b> has been forced in, the developing device unit A is supported for pivotal movement about the coupling pin <b>50</b>, while on the other hand, the coupling pin <b>50</b> is restrained in the photosensitive member unit B with strength to withstand a predetermined or greater pull-out load. An aperture portion <b>32</b> of a bag aperture shape is provided around the inner supporting hole <b>31</b><i>b </i>to enhance the holding force of the coupling pin <b>50</b> and prevent the slipping-out of the pin and the fall of the shavings of the frame body during the insertion thereof. The coupling pin <b>50</b> has its rear end portion inserted thereafter to the position of the bag hole bottom <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the aperture portion <b>32</b>. Also, the coupling pin <b>50</b> may be such a pin having a level difference in the diametral direction thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The coupling of the developing device unit A and the photosensitive member unit B on the lengthwisely opposite side is done in a similar manner.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">First Disassembling Tool</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A first disassembling tool <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is such that a first positioning portion <b>61</b> and a second positioning portion <b>62</b> are provided on a first plate <b>64</b> which is a supporting portion or base body.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A pushing-out portion <b>63</b> is fixed to two connecting bars <b>66</b> parallel to each other. Further, the connecting bars <b>66</b> extend through the first plate <b>64</b> and are fixed to a second plate <b>67</b> at fixing portions <b>67</b><i>a </i>and <b>67</b><i>b</i>.

Therefore, the pushing-out portion <b>63</b> becomes slidable in the direction of arrow D relative to the first positioning portion <b>61</b> and the second positioning portion <b>62</b> provided on the first plate <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also, the first positioning portion <b>61</b> is of a concave shape so as to be positioned on a convex portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>provided on one end of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, and is made of resin so as not to injure or bruise the convex portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>during positioning. Also, the second positioning portion <b>62</b> is of a convex shape so as to be engaged with and positioned by a slot <b>13</b><i>b </i>formed in the cleaning frame body <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A description will now be provided of a method of disassembling the cartridge P by the use of the above-described first disassembling tool <b>60</b> and second disassembling tool <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Disassembling Method</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are perspective views and cross-sectional views showing the manner in which the cartridge P is disassembled by the use of the first disassembling tool <b>60</b> and the second disassembling tool <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the cartridge P is to be disassembled, use is first made of the first disassembling tool <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B). The cleaning frame body <b>13</b> is provided with the exposure opening portion <b>2</b> for applying therethrough a laser beam from the optical system <b>1</b> provided in the image forming apparatus L to the photosensitive drum <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The pushing-out portion <b>63</b> is inserted into the interior of the cartridge through the exposure opening portion <b>2</b> by rotating the tool <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Thereafter, the first positioning portion <b>61</b> is positioned by a convex portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>provided on one end of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> and the second positioning portion is fitted into a slot <b>13</b><i>b </i>formed in the cleaning frame body <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4A</figref>). Thereafter, the second plate <b>67</b> is slid in the direction of arrow G while the first plate <b>64</b> is held down by a hand (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4B</figref>). Then, the pushing-out portion <b>63</b> destroys the bag hole bottom <b>32</b><i>b </i>provided in the cleaning frame body <b>13</b> and pushes the coupling pin <b>50</b> out of the cartridge P through the pin discharging port <b>64</b><i>a </i>formed in the first plate <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). In this case, the diameter r<b>1</b> of the tip end of the pushing-out pin <b>63</b><i>a </i>of the pushing-out portion <b>63</b> is in the relation that r<b>1</b>&lt;r<b>2</b> relative to the diameter r<b>2</b> of the coupling pin <b>50</b> and therefore, after the pushing-out portion <b>63</b> has destroyed the bag hole bottom <b>32</b><i>b</i>, it can push the coupling pin <b>50</b> out of the cartridge P. Consequently, it never happens that the diameter of the hole <b>32</b> with which the coupling pin is engaged is enlarged. That is, it never happens that the coupling pin <b>50</b> comes off when it is again inserted during reproduction.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Also, when as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, in case that the pin is a coupling pin <b>51</b> having a level difference in the diametral direction thereof, a bag hole shape need not be provided in the outer side plate B<b>2</b> of the photosensitive member unit. That is, the coupling pin <b>51</b> is positioned on the outer side plate B<b>2</b> of the photosensitive member unit by the level difference portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>and therefore, it never happens that the coupling pin <b>51</b> comes off relative to the direction of insertion. Accordingly, the level difference portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>strikes against the outer side plate B<b>2</b> of the photosensitive member unit when the coupling pin <b>51</b> is inserted again and therefore, it never happens that the coupling pin <b>51</b> comes down into the cartridge P.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, in the above-described embodiment, the pin discharging port <b>64</b><i>a </i>is provided to take out the coupling pin <b>50</b> when the coupling pin <b>50</b> is pushed out by the pushing-out portion <b>63</b>. However, if as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>, the tip end of the coupling pin <b>50</b> which has been pushed out is brought outwardly of the outer side plate B<b>2</b> of the photosensitive member unit and it is pulled out by a hand, the pin discharging port <b>64</b><i>a </i>need not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Subsequently, the coupling pin <b>50</b> in the lengthwisely opposite direction is likewise taken out by the use of the second disassembling tool <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The pushing-out portion <b>73</b> is inserted through the exposure opening portion <b>2</b> while the tool is rotated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Thereafter, the first positioning portion <b>71</b> is positioned by the cylindrical guide <b>13</b><i>a</i>L provided on the other end of the photosensitive drum <b>10</b> the second positioning portion <b>72</b> is fitted in the slot <b>13</b><i>c </i>formed in the cleaning frame body <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 6A</figref>). Thereafter, as in the case of the above-described first disassembling tool <b>60</b>, the coupling pin <b>50</b> is pushed out of the cartridge P (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>).</p>

When the above-described construction is adopted, a prescribed interval g is maintained between the first plate <b>64</b> and the second plate <b>67</b>. Therefore, after positioning has been effected by the first positioning portion <b>61</b> and the second positioning portion <b>62</b>, when the second plate <b>67</b> is slid in the direction of arrow H while the first plate <b>64</b> is held down by a hand, it is possible to put the fingers into the interval g, and the second plate <b>67</b> can be gripped easily.

Further, biasing means <b>100</b> are provided on the small-diametered portions <b>66</b><i>b </i>of the connecting bars <b>66</b> between the first plate <b>64</b> and the pushing-out portion <b>63</b>. The biasing means <b>100</b> are formed by compression coil springs or the like to bias the first plate <b>64</b> and the pushing-out portion <b>63</b> away from each other. By the above-described construction, the second plate <b>67</b> is slid in the direction of arrow I and the coupling pin <b>50</b> is pushed out, whereafter the first plate <b>64</b> is biased in the direction of arrow J by the biasing means <b>100</b> and is returned to the level difference portions <b>66</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). Thus, when the first disassembling tool <b>60</b> is used next time, the prescribed interval g is maintained from the first, and the work of returning the first plate <b>64</b> to the level difference portions <b>66</b><i>a </i>can be omitted.
