<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a high precision positioning apparatus for positioning a recording medium with respect to an optical system in a holographic storage device with high accuracy, and more particularly, to a high precision positioning apparatus for accurately positioning a recording medium by roughly positioning the recording medium and then minutely moving the roughly positioned recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, as storage devices for a computer or the like, there has been widely used magnetic or optical recording media in which information is two-dimensionally written and/or from which information is two-dimensionally read. Examples of known magnetic storage devices include a floppy (registered trademark) disk, a hard disk, and so on, and examples of known optical storage devices include a compact disc (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), and so on. In order to meet demand for storage devices having a larger storage capacity, a remarkable advance in the recording density has been made hitherto. Also, development of storage devices using the principle of a hologram (hereinafter, referred to as holographic storage devices) is underway as means for realizing a further increased storage capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A holographic storage device stores information on a hologram, which is formed by causing interference between encoded object light and reference light on a recording medium. Object light is radiated onto a recording medium in the form of two-dimensional digital data, and only reference light is radiated onto the recording medium when information is reproduced. Accordingly, a need arises for accurately positioning the optical system and recording medium of the object light and reference light. Such positioning is carried out by moving a flat-plate shaped recording medium in an in-plane direction while fixing the optical system in place. An example of such a holographic storage device is described in Patent Document 1.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">[Patent Document]</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-93157.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The conventional holographic storage devices that have been widely used are card- or disk-type recording media. In the case of a card-type recording medium, each slider is provided in each of the X and Y directions and the recording medium is moved with respect to the optical system using each slider so that the recording medium can be moved in mutually orthogonal X and Y directions in a plane thereof. In the case of a disk-type recording medium, a motor is coupled to the center of the recording medium for moving the recording medium in its circumferential direction, and a slider traversing the motor is provided for moving the recording medium in its radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the positioning apparatus of recording media in the conventional holographic storage device has the following drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to randomly access data, a recording medium required to be largely moved in units of pages forming holograms. Meanwhile, in order to accurately position the recording medium with respect to the optical system, minute adjustment in positioning the recording medium is required. To perform minute movement, stepping of a driving motor or slider should be performed in a microscopic manner. If rough movement is performed on such driving system, a large load is undesirably applied to the system. In other words, it is difficult to make the rough movement of a recording medium compatible with the minute movement thereof, which results in high cost of the recording medium positioning apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been attained to solve the above problems. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a high precision positioning apparatus capable of realizing accurate positioning of a recording medium with respect to an optical system by minute movement at a relatively low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to accomplish the above object, a high precision positioning apparatus according to the present invention comprises a driving unit for minutely moving a flat-plate shaped recording medium, which records/reproduces information using light, with respect to an optical system in an in-plane direction of the recording medium, a recording portion of the recording medium being positioned in a predetermined position by the driving unit, wherein the driving unit comprises a frame-shaped unit body, a first drive frame accommodated inside the unit body, a second drive frame accommodated inside the first drive frame and fixed in the vicinity of the recording portion of the recording medium, and wherein the first drive frame freely moves with respect to the unit body in an in-plane direction of the recording medium by means of micro-driving elements, and the second drive frame freely moves with respect to the first drive frame by means of micro-driving elements in an in-plane direction of the recording medium, in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction in which the first drive frame moves, so that the recording medium is minutely moved in an in-plane direction of the recording medium by moving the first drive frame and the second drive frame with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in a high precision positioning apparatus according to the present invention, the first drive frame moves linearly and rotates with respect to the unit body by means of two micro-driving elements, and the second drive frame moves linearly and rotates with respect to the first drive frame by means of two micro-driving elements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, in a high precision positioning apparatus according to the present invention, the first drive frame is connected to the unit body by elastic bodies, and the second drive frame is connected to the first drive frame through other elastic bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, in a high precision positioning apparatus according to the present invention, there is provided, the second drive frame includes air holes disposed substantially perpendicular to the recording medium, and the second drive frame is fixed to or isolated from the recording medium by the air aspirated or ejected through the air holes.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, in a high precision positioning apparatus according to the present invention, the optical system includes an optical reference block that defines a predetermined position of the recording portion, and the optical reference block includes air holes disposed substantially perpendicular to the recording medium, and the optical reference block is fixed to or isolated from the recording medium by air aspirated or ejected through the air holes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIG. <b>1</b> is a plan view of a high precision positioning apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a positional relationship between a recording medium, optical systems and the high precision positioning apparatus. As shown in the drawings, the high precision positioning apparatus in the present embodiment is used for minutely moving a flat-plate shaped recording medium <b>10</b> of a holographic storage device with respect to an optical unit <b>30</b> consisting of an object optical system <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a reference optical system <b>30</b><i>b</i>. That is, the high precision positioning apparatus accurately positions the recording medium <b>10</b> by minutely moving the recording medium <b>10</b> in X, Y and θ directions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> using a driving unit <b>1</b>. The driving unit <b>1</b> includes a unit body <b>2</b> formed of a substantially rectangular frame, a-first drive frame <b>3</b> accommodated inside the unit body <b>2</b> and having a substantially rectangular shape, and a second drive frame <b>4</b> accommodated inside the first drive frame <b>3</b> and having a substantially rectangular shape. Also, rough positioning of the recording medium <b>10</b> is performed such that the recording medium <b>10</b> is moved in units of pages in the X and Y directions by means of a slider <b>20</b> connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the driving unit <b>1</b> has a substantially flat-plate shape as a whole, and is disposed opposite to a surface of the recording medium <b>10</b> facing the optical unit <b>30</b>. In other words, the recording medium <b>10</b> is interposed between the driving unit <b>1</b> and the optical unit <b>30</b>. The unit body <b>2</b> is fixed so as not to move with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b> in an in-plane direction of the recording medium <b>10</b>. Also, the unit body <b>2</b>, the first drive frame <b>3</b> and the second drive frame <b>4</b> that constitute the driving unit <b>1</b> are formed by an etching process using silicon. Here, a micro-fabrication technique using a material other than metal can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first drive frame <b>3</b> freely moves with respect to the unit body <b>2</b> in the X and θ directions by means of two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> that linearly extend or contract in the X direction, and elastic bodies <b>6</b> are provided in the X and Y directions, respectively, to resist operations of the micro-driving elements <b>5</b>. Here, the micro-driving elements <b>5</b>, extending or contracting by applying an electric field thereto, include piezoelectric elements or the like. Also, the elastic bodies <b>6</b>, which are formed of leaf springs, suspend the first drive frame <b>3</b> to the unit body <b>2</b> and allow the first drive frame <b>3</b> to move in a stable manner. Here, the elastic bodies <b>6</b> are not limited to leaf springs, and any other kinds of springs or rubber may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Since the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> are provided to extend or contract in the X direction, the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> are made simultaneously extend or contract by the same length so that the first drive frame <b>3</b> can linearly move in the X direction with respect to the unit body <b>2</b>. Also, the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> can rotate the first drive frame <b>3</b> in the θ direction with respect to the unit body <b>2</b> by allowing a difference between the extension and contraction of the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> in the X direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the second drive frame <b>4</b> freely moves with respect to the first drive frame <b>3</b> in the Y and θ directions by means of the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> that linearly extend or contract in the Y direction, and elastic bodies <b>6</b> are provided in the X and Y directions, respectively, to resist operations of the micro-driving elements <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Since the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> are provided to extend or contract in the Y direction, the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b> are made simultaneously extend or contract by the same length so that the second drive frame <b>4</b> can linearly move in the Y direction with respect to the first drive frame <b>3</b>. In other words, with respect to the micro-driving elements provided in the first drive frame <b>3</b>, the micro-driving elements <b>5</b> of the second drive frame <b>4</b> are provided so as to move the second drive frame <b>4</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the operations of the micro-driving elements provided in the first drive frame <b>3</b>. Also, the micro-driving elements <b>5</b> can rotate the second drive frame <b>4</b> in the θ direction with respect to the first frame <b>3</b> by allowing a difference between the extension and contraction of the two micro-driving elements <b>5</b>. Like the elastic bodies <b>6</b> provided between the unit body <b>2</b> and the first drive frame <b>3</b>, the elastic bodies <b>6</b> of the second drive frame <b>4</b> suspend the second drive frame <b>4</b> to the first drive frame <b>3</b> and allow the second drive frame <b>4</b> to move in a stable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Also, the second drive frame <b>4</b> is fixed to the peripheral edge of the recording portion <b>11</b> of the recording medium <b>10</b> to be in surface contact therewith. Since the second drive frame <b>4</b> is capable of moving with respect to the first drive frame <b>3</b> in the Y and θ direction and the first drive frame <b>3</b> is capable of moving with respect to the unit body <b>2</b> in the X and θ directions, the second drive frame <b>4</b> can move with respect to the unit body <b>2</b> in the X, Y and θ directions. That is to say, the recording medium <b>10</b> fixed to the second drive frame <b>4</b> can be moved with respect to the unit body <b>2</b> and the optical unit <b>30</b> in the X, Y and θ directions. The second drive frame <b>4</b> is provided with air holes <b>7</b> connected to a pump (not shown) substantially perpendicular to the recording medium <b>10</b>. Air is aspirated or ejected through the air holes <b>7</b>, thereby fixing the recording medium <b>10</b> to the optical reference block <b>31</b> or isolating the same therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The optical unit <b>30</b> includes an object optical system <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a reference optical system <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Also, an optical reference block <b>31</b> having an opening <b>31</b><i>a </i>is provided on the bottom surface of the optical unit <b>30</b>. The bottom surface of the optical reference block <b>31</b> is flat, and becomes a reference in positioning the recording medium <b>10</b> with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b>. The optical reference block <b>31</b> is provided with air holes <b>32</b> connected to a pump (not shown) so as to be in a substantially perpendicular direction to the recording medium <b>10</b>. Air may be aspirated or ejected through the air holes <b>32</b>, thereby fixing/isolating the recording medium <b>10</b> to/from the optical reference block <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The recording medium <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment is card-shaped and formed of a photorefractive material or a photopolymer material. The recording medium <b>10</b> forms a hologram by the object optical system <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the reference optical system <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the optical unit <b>30</b> on a plane thereof, and recording information. Also, the information is reproduced by the reference optical system <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the optical unit <b>30</b> and is then read. The information recorded on the recoding medium <b>10</b> is recorded on or reproduced from the recording medium <b>10</b> in the form of two-dimensional digital data. Thus, the information is recorded on or reproduced from the recording medium <b>10</b> in units of pages. In other words, information is recorded on the recording medium <b>10</b> in a state in which a plurality of pages is arranged in a row. Thus, for recording or reproducing of information, it is necessary to perform positioning by moving the recording medium <b>10</b> with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b> in units of pages in the X and Y directions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Here, the operation of moving the recording medium <b>10</b> with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b> in units of pages is performed by a slider <b>20</b> connected to the recording medium <b>10</b>. At this stage, positioning is achieved to an extent, that is, with an accuracy of about 10 μm. However, the positioning performed by the slider <b>20</b> is not accurate enough to record/reproduce the hologram. Thus, in this embodiment, accurate positioning (with an accuracy of 1 μm or less) of the recording medium <b>10</b> with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b> is performed in such a state by means of the minute movement of the recording medium <b>10</b> by the driving unit <b>1</b> in the X, Y and θ directions. In other words, the slider <b>20</b>, which has been conventionally used for positioning of the recording medium <b>10</b>, is used for rough positioning, and the high precision positioning apparatus according to the present invention, specifically, the driving unit <b>1</b>, is used for accurate positioning. In such a manner, the conventional positioning apparatus and the positioning apparatus according to the present invention perform their intrinsic functions, independently.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, a process of positioning the recording medium <b>10</b> with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the relationship between the recording medium <b>10</b>, the optical unit <b>30</b> and the high precision positioning apparatus, in which only the recording medium <b>10</b>, the optical reference block <b>31</b> and the second drive frame <b>4</b> are schematically shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a state in which the recording medium <b>10</b> is roughly positioned by the slider <b>20</b>. In this state, the recording medium <b>10</b> is spaced apart from the optical reference block <b>31</b> and the second drive frame <b>4</b>, and the recording medium <b>10</b> is roughly moved in units of pages in the X and Y direction in a plane thereof by the slider <b>20</b> connected to the recording medium <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a state in which the recording medium <b>10</b> is roughly moved by the slider <b>20</b>, the recording portion <b>11</b> of the recording medium <b>10</b> is not accurately positioned with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b>. Here, the positioning is performed in the plane of the recording medium <b>10</b>. However, when the recording medium <b>10</b> is not accurately positioned in the X, Y and θ directions, recording/reproduction cannot be performed properly. Thus, accurate positioning of the recording medium is performed using the driving unit <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a process of fixing the driving unit <b>1</b> to the recording medium <b>10</b>. That is, the whole driving unit <b>1</b> is pushed up to get closer to the recording medium <b>10</b> until it is brought into surface contact with the recording medium <b>10</b>, and air is aspirated through the air holes <b>7</b> provided in the surface of the second drive frame <b>4</b> to fix the recording medium <b>10</b> thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows a process of minutely moving the recording medium <b>10</b> by the driving unit <b>1</b>. If the driving unit <b>1</b> is fixed to the recording medium <b>10</b>, the driving unit <b>1</b> is further pushed up to get closer to the optical reference block <b>31</b>. When the driving unit <b>1</b> gets closer to the optical reference block <b>31</b>, air is ejected through the air holes <b>32</b> of the optical reference block <b>31</b>. The air ejected through the air holes <b>32</b> of the optical reference block <b>31</b> forms an air layer on the surface of the recording medium <b>10</b>, thereby preventing the recording medium <b>10</b> from contacting with the optical reference block <b>31</b> during the positioning process.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described above, after the recording medium <b>10</b> is not allowed to directly contact the optical reference block <b>31</b>, the driving unit <b>1</b> is actuated to position the recording medium fixed to the second drive frame <b>4</b> in the X, Y and θ directions. The recording medium <b>10</b> does not contact the optical reference block <b>31</b> while it is positioned by performing the positioning thereof in such a state, thereby avoiding scratching of the recording medium <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows a process of fixing the recording medium <b>10</b> to the optical reference block <b>31</b>. When positioning of the recording medium <b>10</b> by the driving unit <b>1</b> is completed, ejection of air from the air holes <b>32</b> of the optical reference block <b>31</b> is stopped and aspiration of air is then started. Also, aspiration of air by the air holes <b>7</b> of the second drive frame <b>4</b> is stopped and ejection of air is started. By doing so, the recording medium <b>10</b> getting closer to the optical reference block <b>31</b> is isolated from the second drive frame <b>4</b> to be in surface contact with the optical reference block <b>31</b> and fixed thereto. In such a manner, the recording portion <b>11</b> of the recording medium <b>10</b> can be positioned with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, it will be recognized and understood that the invention is not limited thereto and various modifications may be made within the scope of the technical idea thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the present embodiment has shown that the air holes <b>7</b> and <b>32</b> are provided in the second drive frame <b>4</b> and the optical reference block <b>31</b>, respectively, to aspirate or eject air, thereby fixing/isolating the recording medium <b>10</b> to/from the second drive frame <b>4</b> and the optical reference block <b>31</b>, pins may be provided on the second drive frame <b>4</b>, instead of the air holes, the pins capable of freely communicating in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the recording medium <b>10</b>. The recording medium <b>10</b> may be brought into contact with the optical reference block <b>31</b> by pushing up the pins. With this arrangement, a pump for aspirating or ejecting air may not be provided, thereby further reducing the manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, although the present embodiment has shown that the recording medium <b>10</b> has a card shape and the movement of the recording medium <b>10</b> in units of pages is performed in the X and Y directions, the shape of the recording medium <b>10</b> is not limited thereto, and the shape of a disk, such as a CD or DVD, can be employed. In the case where the recording medium <b>10</b> has a disk shape, in order to move the recording medium <b>10</b> in units of pages, a motor is connected to a central portion of the recording medium <b>10</b> and a slider traversing the motor in the X direction is provided. Linear motion and rotation of the recording medium <b>10</b> are performed using the motor and the slider, thereby roughly positioning the recording medium <b>10</b> with respect to the optical unit <b>30</b>. Then, the driving unit <b>1</b> is configured in the same manner as in the present embodiment and accurately positions the recording medium <b>10</b> in the X, Y and θ directions. As described above, the driving unit <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment can also be applied to the disk-shaped recording medium <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, the high precision positioning apparatus comprises a unit body, a first drive frame accommodated inside the unit body, a second drive frame accommodated inside the first drive frame and fixed in the vicinity of a recording portion of the recording medium. The first drive frame freely moves with respect to the unit body by means of micro-driving elements in an in-plane direction of the recording medium, and the second drive frame freely moves with respect to the first drive frame by means of micro-driving elements in an in-plane direction of the recording medium, in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction in which the first drive frame moves. Thus, the high precision positioning apparatus according to the present invention can perform micro-positioning of a recording medium using mechanism different from a mechanism for moving a recording medium largely, that is, in units of pages, in a holographic storage device. Accordingly, the motor or slider performs rough positioning while ensuring a sufficiently high positioning accuracy of the recording medium, thereby reducing the cost.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, according to the high precision positioning apparatus of the present invention, the first drive frame moves linearly and rotates with respect to the unit body by means of two micro-driving elements, and the second drive frame moves linearly and rotates with respect to the first drive frame by means of two micro-driving elements, thereby accurately positioning the recording portion of the recording medium with respect to the optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, according to the high precision positioning apparatus of the present invention, the first drive frame is connected to the unit body by elastic bodies, and the second drive frame is connected to the first drive frame through other elastic bodies so that the first drive frame can be suspended to the unit body, and the second drive frame can be suspended to the first drive frame, thereby forming a triple structure and operating the first drive frame and the second drive frame in a stable manner.</p>
