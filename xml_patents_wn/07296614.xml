<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the casting of steel strip by a single or a twin roll caster. In a twin roll caster, molten metal is introduced between a pair of counter-rotated horizontally positioned casting rolls, which are internally cooled so that metal shells solidify on the moving roll surfaces and are brought together at the nip between them to produce a thin cast strip product delivered downwardly from the nip. The term “nip” is used herein to refer to the general region at which the rolls are closest together. The molten metal may be poured from a ladle into a smaller vessel, from which it flows through a metal delivery nozzle located above the nip forming a casting pool of molten metal supported on the casting surfaces of the rolls. This casting pool is usually confined between side plates or dams held in sliding engagement with end surfaces of the rolls so as to dam the two ends of the casting pool against outflow.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When casting steel strip in a twin roll caster, the casting pool will generally be at a temperature in excess of 1550° C., and usually 1600° C. and greater. It is necessary to achieve very rapid cooling of the molten steel over the casting surfaces of the rolls in order to form solidified shells in the short period of exposure on the casting surfaces to the molten steel casting pool during each revolution of the casting rolls. Moreover, it is important to achieve even solidification so as to avoid distortion of the solidifying shells which come together at the nip to form the steel strip. Distortion of the shells can lead to surface defects known as “crocodile skin surface roughness.” Crocodile skin surface roughness is known to occur with high carbon levels above 0.065%, and even with carbon levels below 0.065% by weight carbon. Crocodile skin roughness, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is known to occur for other reasons. Crocodile skin roughness involves periodic rises and falls in the strip surface of 40 to 80 microns, in periods of 5 to 10 millimeters, measured by profilometer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">We have found that with carbon levels below 0.065% by weight the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness is directly related to the heat flux between the molten metal and the surface of the casting rolls, and that the formation of crocodile skin roughness can be controlled by controlling the heat flux between the molten metal and the surface of the casting rolls. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> reports dip tests that illustrates the relationship between the heat flux and the formation of crocodile skin roughness during the formation of the metal shells on the surfaces of the casting rolls in making the thin cast strip. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, we have also found that by controlling the energy exerted by rotating brushes peripherally in contact with the casting surfaces of each casting roll, in advance of contact of the casting surface with the molten metal, that the heat flux between the molten metal and the surface of the casting rolls, and in turn crocodile skin surface roughness on the resulting thin cast strip can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This relationship between the heat flux from the molten metal and the surface of the casting rolls and the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness on the thin cast strip has been found to occur whether the casting roll surfaces are smooth or textured. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> reports dip tests that illustrate how the heat flux is changed with both smooth and textured casting surfaces on the casting rolls. We have also found that the texture of the casting roll surfaces of the casting rolls change during casting. This change can cause a change in heat flux from the molten metal to the casting roll surfaces and in turn a change in formation of crocodile skin surface roughness on the thin cast strip. We have found a method of directly controlling the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness by controlling the heat flux between the molten metal and the casting roll surfaces, to avoid high fluctuations in the heat flux during the formation of the metal shells during casting and in turn control the forming of crocodile skin surface roughness in the thin cast strip produced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The method of controlling the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness in continuous casting of thin cast strip of plain carbon steel is disclosed that comprises the steps of:</p>

These exposed projections of the casting surface, however, may be about one-twentieth or one-thirtieth, or less, of the surface area of the casting surface. There is still residual material, including metal and oxides, in the “valleys,” entices and other low areas of the casting surfaces, as opposed to the raised areas of the casting surfaces. More specifically, the casting surfaces of the casting rolls may be textured with a random distribution of discrete projections as described and claimed in application Ser.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In any event, a substantial portion of the casting surface is exposed by the cleaning of the casting surfaces so that there can be wetting of the casting surface by the molten metal when the casting surface is rotated into contact with the casting pool. Cleaning here does not mean the casting surfaces are completely clean of all contaminates. Clean here means that the parts of the casting roll surfaces that are exposed, the projections, are substantially free from matter that adulterates or contaminates wetting of the casting surfaces by the molten metal and inhibits effective heat flux from the molten metal to the casting surfaces. It is not necessary or practical for the brushes to clean all exposed projections of the casting surface. Clean means that the exposed casting surfaces are sufficiently clean that the formation of crocodile skin roughness is inhibited, if not eliminated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 11</figref> illustrate cleaning of the casting surface to expose a majority of the projections of the surface in accordance with this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The energy exerted by the cleaning brush against the casting surface of the casting roll is determined by the pressure by the brush against the casting surface and the speed of rotation of the brush and the casting speed. This may be done, for example, by measuring the throughput and/or the differential pressure of hydraulic fluid through hydraulic motors, which power the brushes cleaning the casting surfaces of the casting rolls.

In any event, the monitoring of the torque of the hydraulic motors, and in turn the energy exerted by the bushes against the casting surfaces, may be controlled manually or by automated controls, but the automated controls provide the best mode of performing the invention as explained by for example below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The casting surfaces of the casting rolls may be textured projections, and in addition may be with a random distribution of discrete projections.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an alternative, the method of controlling the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness in continuous casting of thin-cast strip may comprise the steps of:</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The casting surfaces, of which the clean bands are a part, are typically textured. The casting surfaces have a majority of extended portions of said projections exposed for contact with the molten metal of the casting pool. However, the exposed surfaces of the clean bands are still a minor part of the area of the casting surfaces of the casting rolls. There is still residue in the “valleys,” entices and other low areas of the clean bands (as opposed to the raised areas of the clean bands) which may be the majority of the surface area. More specifically, again, the casting surfaces of the casting rolls may be textured with a random distribution of discrete projections as described and claimed in application Ser. No. 10/077,391, filed Feb. 15, 2002 and published Sep. 12, 2002, as US 2002-0124990, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. In any event, again, the exposed surface is not the majority of the casting surfaces or the clean bands thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, a substantial portion of the casting surface is exposed by the cleaning of the casting surfaces so that they can be wetted of the casting surface by the molten metal when the casting surface is rotated into contact with the casting pool. Further, clean here means that the parts of the casting roll surfaces that are exposed are substantially free from matter that adulterates or contaminates wetting of the casting surfaces by the molten metal, and inhibits effective heat flux from the molten metal to the casting surfaces.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As before, the energy exerted by the cleaning brush against the casting surface of the casting roll is determined by the pressure by the brush against the casting surface and the speed of rotation of the brush and the casting speed. This can be measured and controlled by the flow of hydraulic fluid through a hydraulic motor driving rotation of the brush and in turn the speed of rotation of the brushes, and/or by pressure differential hydraulic fluid across the hydraulic motors driving the brushes, and in turn the torques of the hydraulic motors and the pressure exerted by the brushes against the casting surfaces of the casting rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A further alternative, the method of controlling the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness in continuous casting of thin-cast strip of plain carbon steel comprising the steps of:</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">This alternative has the advantage that the initial heat flux measured provides the reference for the clean casting surfaces of the casting rolls cleaned, as above described to serve as the reference for cleaning throughout the casting campaign. The same effective cleaning of the casting surfaces can thus be controlled and maintained through the casting campaign. In turn, the cleaning of the casting surfaces can be monitored and controlled indirectly by controlling the energy exerted by rotating brush against the casting rolls either manually or automatically as explained in detail by example below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The energy of the rotating brush against the casting roll may be in turn controlled based on the casting speed by varying the application pressure or the speed of rotation, or both, of an electric, pneumatic or hydraulic motor rotating the brush against the casting surface. The energy of the rotating brush can be measured by measuring the torque of the motor rotating. The heat flux between the molten metal and the casting surfaces of the casting rolls may be initially measured and continually measured, as well as the difference between the real time heat flux and the initial heat flux measured, by measuring the difference in temperature of the cooling water circulated through the casting roll between the inlet and outlet as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,588,493 and 6,755,234. Still it is contemplated that the heat flux can be measured by any available method. In any event, by monitoring the heat flux and calculating the difference in heat flux from the initial heat flux measured, the energy exerted by the brush against the casting surface can be automatically controlled by a control system that receives electrical signals from the monitor corresponding to the measured heat flux, and controls the energy exerted by the brush against the casting roll based on the difference in heat flux from the initial heat flux measured.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, the method of controlling the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness in continuous casting of thin-cast strip may include the additional step of:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">controlling the pressure of the gas blown through ports onto the casting surfaces of the casting rolls based on the difference between said measured heat flux and an initially measured heat flux between the molten metal and the casting surfaces to assist in controlling the formation of crocodile skin surface roughness in continuous casting of thin-cast strip.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The embodiments are described with reference to a twin roll caster in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</figref>. The illustrated twin roll caster comprises a main machine frame <b>11</b> which supports a pair of parallel casting rolls <b>12</b> of generally textured outer peripheral casting surfaces <b>12</b>A. Molten metal of plain carbon steel of less than 0.065% by weight carbon is supplied during a casting operation from a ladle <b>13</b> through a refractory ladle outlet shroud <b>14</b> to a tundish <b>15</b>, and from there, through a metal delivery nozzle <b>16</b> (also called a core nozzle) between the casting rolls <b>12</b> above the nip <b>17</b>. Hot metal thus delivered forms a molten metal casting pool <b>10</b> above the nip <b>17</b> supported on the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A. This pool <b>10</b> is confined at the ends of the rolls by a pair of side closure or side dam plates <b>18</b> which may be held against stepped ends of the casting rolls <b>12</b> by actuation of a pair of hydraulic cylinder units (not shown). The upper surface of the pool <b>10</b> (generally referred to as the “meniscus” level) may rise above the lower end of the delivery nozzle <b>16</b> so that the lower end of the delivery nozzle is immersed within the pool.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Casting rolls <b>12</b> are water cooled so that shells solidify on the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A as the casting surfaces move in contact with the casting pool <b>10</b>. The casting surfaces may textured, for example, with a random distribution of discrete projections as described and claimed in application Ser. No. 10/077,391, filed Feb. 15, 2002 and published Sep. 12, 2002, as US 2002-0124990. The shells are brought together at the nip <b>17</b> between the casting rolls to produce a solidified thin cast strip product <b>19</b> at the nip <b>17</b>. This thin cast product <b>19</b> may be fed, typically with further processing, to a standard coiler (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The illustrated twin roll caster as thus far described is of the kind which is illustrated and described in some detail in our Australian Patent 631728 and our U.S. Pat. No. 5,184,668, both being incorporated by reference. Reference may be made to those patents for appropriate constructional details which form no part of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A pair of roll brushes denoted generally as <b>21</b> is disposed adjacent the pair of casting rolls such that they may be brought into contact with the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b> at opposite sides of nip <b>17</b> prior to the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A coming into contact with the molten metal casting pool <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Each brush apparatus <b>21</b> comprises a brush frame <b>20</b> which carries a main cleaning brush <b>22</b>, for cleaning the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b> during the casting campaign, and optionally, a separate sweeper brush <b>23</b> cleaning the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b> at the beginning and end of the casting campaign. The main cleaning brush <b>22</b> may be segmented, if desired, but is generally one brush extending across the casting roll surface of <b>12</b>A of each casting roll <b>12</b>. Frame <b>20</b> may comprise a base plate <b>41</b> and upstanding side plates <b>42</b> on which the main cleaning brush <b>22</b> is mounted. Base plate <b>41</b> may be fitted with slides <b>43</b> which are slidable along a track member <b>44</b> to allow the frame <b>20</b> to be moved toward and away from one of the casting rolls <b>12</b>, and thereby move the main brush <b>22</b> mounted on the frame <b>20</b> by operation of the main brush actuator <b>28</b>. A sweeper brush <b>23</b>, if present, may be mounted on frame <b>20</b> to move independently of the main brush <b>22</b> by operation of sweeper brush actuator <b>28</b>A from retracted positions to operative positions in contact with the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b>, so that either the sweeper brush <b>23</b> or the main brush <b>22</b>, or both, may be brushing the casting surfaces of the casting rolls without interruption in the brushing operation between them.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">What is important is that the energy exerted by the cleaning brush <b>22</b> against the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b> is controlled so that the cleaning of the casting roll surfaces is maintained at a specified level during the casting campaign, and in turn formation of crocodile skin roughness on the thin cast strip is controlled. The energy exerted by the brush on the casting surface <b>12</b>A is controlled by controlling the pressure of the brush on the casting rolls, or the rotational speed of the cleaning brush <b>22</b>, or both, based on measurement of the heat flux from the molten metal in the casting pool <b>10</b> to the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b>. This pressure and rotational speed will be varied according to the casting speed during the casting campaign. This control may be done manually or automatically as described in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The method may be practiced by controlling the energy exerted by the rotating brush to maintain the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b> clean, as above described, during the casting campaign. This may be done by cleaning to expose a majority of the projections of the casting surfaces of the casting rolls <b>12</b>, and measuring this initial heat flux between the molten metal and the casting rolls. The heat flux is then continually measured in real time either continuously or intermittently during the casting campaign, and then the difference between the real time heat flux and the initial heat flux measured, to control the energy exerted by the cleaning brush <b>22</b> on the casting roll surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting rolls <b>12</b>. The heat flux, both initially and in real time, can be measured by measuring the difference in temperature of the cooling water circulated through the casting rolls between the inlet and outlet as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,588,493 and 6,755,234. Still, it is contemplated that the heat flux can be measured by any available method.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The initial measured heat flux is related to the desired degree of cleaning of the casting roll surfaces <b>12</b>A, as above described, to control the formation of crocodile skin roughness during the casting campaign. The continual measured heat flux in real time, and the difference between the initial heat flux and the real time heat flux measured, is used to control the energy exerted by the cleaning brush on the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A so that cleaning of the casting roll surfaces <b>12</b>A is controlled, and in turn, the formation of crocodile skin roughness on the surface of the cast strip controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The method can thus be automated by providing a control system (not shown) responsive to sensors monitoring the heat flux, calculating the difference in heat flux from the initial heat flux measured, and controlling the energy exerted by the brush against the casting surface based in the difference in heat flux from the initially heat flux measured. The cleaning brush <b>22</b>, the main cleaning brush, may be in the form of a cylindrical barrel brush having a central body <b>45</b> carried on a shaft <b>34</b> and fitted with a cylindrical canopy of wire bristles <b>46</b>. Shaft <b>34</b> may be rotatably mounted in bearings <b>47</b> in the side plates <b>42</b> of frame <b>20</b>, and a hydraulic, pneumatic, or electric drive motor <b>35</b> may be mounted on one of these side plates coupled to the brush shaft <b>34</b> so as to rotatably drive the cleaning brush <b>22</b> in the opposite direction of the rotation of the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of casting roll <b>12</b>. Although the main brush <b>22</b> is shown as a cylindrical barrel brush, it should be understood that this brush may take other forms such as the elongate rectangular brush disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,307,861, the rotary brushing devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,575,327 or the pivoting brushes of Australian Patent Application PO7602. The precise form of the main brush is not important to the present invention. What is important is that the energy exerted by the cleaning brush against the casting surfaces capable of being controlled so the cleaning of exposed casting surface of the casting rolls <b>12</b> is controlled throughout the casting campaign and, in turn, formation of crocodile skin surface roughness of the cast strip is controlled. The energy exerted by cleaning brush <b>22</b> against the casting surface <b>12</b>A of the casting roll <b>12</b> may be controlled by controlling the application pressure or the speed of rotation, or both, of an electric, pneumatic or hydraulic motor rotating the brush coordinated with the casting speed. The energy, pressure or rotation speed of the rotating brush can be measured by measuring the torque of the motor rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The rotational speed of the cleaning brush <b>22</b> can be measured, for example, by a flow meter measuring the flow of hydraulic fluid through a hydraulic motor driving the rotating cleaning brush <b>22</b>. The torque of the motor may be monitored by measuring the pressure differential between inlet and outlet of hydraulic fluid through the hydraulic motors. Alternatively, the torque of the motors, hydraulic, electric or pneumatic, may be monitored by measuring the torque with a strain gauge, load cell or other device between the hydraulic motor and mount for bearings <b>47</b> (i.e., chock) or other convenient part of the motor mount structure.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Although the main cleaning brush <b>22</b> may be driven in a direction counter to the rotation of the casting roll, the main brush <b>22</b> is usually driven in the same rotational direction <b>33</b> as the casting rolls, as indicated by the arrow <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Note means that the casting surface <b>12</b>A is moving in a direction opposite to the movement of the bristles of the brush <b>22</b> against the casting surface of the casting roll.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If used, the separate sweeper brush <b>23</b>, which is peripherally involved in use of the best mode of the invention contemplated, may be in a form of a cylindrical barrel brush which is mounted on frame <b>20</b> so as to be moveable on the frame such that it can be brought into engagement with the casting surface <b>12</b>A of casting roll <b>12</b>, or retracted away from that the casting surface <b>12</b>A by operation of the sweeper brush actuator <b>28</b>A independent of whether the main brush <b>22</b> is engaged with the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of casting roll <b>12</b>. This enables the sweeper brush <b>23</b> to be moved independently of the main brush <b>22</b> and brought into operation only during the start and finish of a casting run and be withdrawn during normal casting as described below. The sweeper brush <b>23</b> may be rotatably driven in tandem with or independently of the main brush <b>22</b>. The sweeper brush <b>23</b> may also be driven in the same direction as the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of casting rolls <b>12</b> at a speed different from the speed of the casting rolls <b>12</b>. In this way, the large accretions that can occur at the start and end of the casting run are less likely to be dragged across the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A and cause scoring of the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A, where the sweeper brush <b>23</b> is contacting the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A and moving in the direction opposite the casting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">If used, sweeper brush <b>23</b> may have a central body <b>24</b> carried on a shaft <b>25</b> and fitted with a cylindrical canopy of wire bristles <b>26</b>. The brush shaft <b>25</b> may be rotatably mounted in a brush mounting structure <b>27</b> which can be moved back and forth by operation of quick acting hydraulic cylinders <b>28</b> to move the brush <b>23</b> inwardly against the casting roll <b>12</b> or to retract it away from the casting roll <b>12</b>. The roll mounting structure <b>27</b> may be in the form of a wide yoke with side wings <b>30</b> in which the brush shaft <b>25</b> is rotatably mounted in bearings <b>31</b>. The brush <b>23</b>, brush mounting structure <b>27</b> and actuator <b>28</b> may be carried on the main frame <b>20</b> of the brushing apparatus <b>21</b> so that the sweeper brush <b>23</b> will always be correctly positioned in advance of the cleaning main brush <b>22</b>. The roll mounting structure <b>27</b> may also carry an elongate scraper blade <b>29</b> which extends throughout the width of the barrel brush <b>23</b> and projects into the canopy of bristles <b>26</b>. Blade <b>29</b> may be made of hardened steel and have a sharp leading edge.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Sweeper brush <b>23</b> may be rotated purely by frictional engagement between its canopy of bristles <b>26</b> with the casting roll <b>12</b>, in which case it may be simply rotatably mounted between the side plates <b>42</b> of frame <b>20</b> without any drive to drive rotation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, typically, the sweeper brush <b>23</b>, if used, is positively driven by provision of a pneumatic, electric or hydraulic drive motor <b>48</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sweeper brush <b>23</b> is biased inwardly against the casting roll <b>12</b> by actuation of the cylinder units <b>28</b> such that it is rotatably driven by the frictional engagement between the canopy of bristles <b>26</b> and the roll surface so that it is rotated in the opposite rotational (same peripheral) direction at the casting surface <b>12</b>A at the region of its engagement with the casting surface, as indicated by the arrows <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The rotation of the sweeper brush <b>23</b> may be retarded by its inter-engagement with the scraper blade <b>29</b> so that the sweeper brush <b>23</b> is driven at a slower peripheral speed than casting roll <b>12</b>. The relative speed between the roll and the barrel brush <b>23</b> may cause effective sweeping action and ensure that the bristles engaging the casting roll will change continuously. The scraper blade <b>29</b> also effectively cleans the sweeper brush <b>23</b> of contaminating material swept from the casting surface <b>12</b>A of the casting roll <b>12</b> so that clean bristles are continuously presented to the casting roll <b>12</b> surface. A sweeper brush drive motor <b>48</b> may be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, so that sweeper brush <b>23</b> can be positively driven at a fixed speed independent of the speed of the casting roll <b>12</b>. It will generally be driven so that its bristles travel in the same rotational direction as the surface of the roll <b>12</b> but at a different (higher or lower) speed. The rotational speed of the sweeper brush <b>23</b> can be varied to optimize this speed differential.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Sweeper brush <b>23</b> is moved into contact with the casting surfaces <b>12</b>A of the casting roll <b>12</b> prior to the start of casting and is moved away from the casting surfaces after casting conditions have stabilized. It is moved back into engagement with the casting surfaces just prior to termination of the cast. The point at which the casting conditions stabilize, and sweeper brush <b>23</b> disengaged from the casting surfaces, is usually about when the set point is reached for the level of the pool <b>10</b> of molten metal, and the point at which the sweeper brush <b>23</b> reengage is usually about when the set point level of the pool <b>10</b> is about to drop as the end of the casting run approaches. The sweeper brush <b>23</b> serves to prevent damage to the main brush <b>22</b> and the casting surface <b>12</b>A of casting roll <b>12</b> due to carry over of debris generated on commencement and near termination of the casting run.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">If clean bands are to be used in practicing the present method, before the casting campaign, each of casting rolls <b>12</b> are prepared with a clean band (not shown) before casting preferably at each end of the casting roll. This may be done by providing a chalk mark or soap stone mark on the casting surface <b>12</b>A of the casting roll by rotating the casting rolls to make the mark along the circumferential surface. This chalk or soap stone mark may be positioned at each end of the casting roll <b>12</b> to ensure that the cold machine roll crown is not affected by creation of clean bands on the casting roll <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, a clean band is positioned about 8 inches from each end of the casting roll and each band is about 15 millimeters in width. After the chalk or soap stone marks are formed on the casting roll surfaces, the cleaning brush <b>22</b> is applied to the casting surface <b>12</b>A of the casting roll <b>12</b> as it is rotated to create the clean bands. The clean bands are characterized by a large central “clean area” with a feathered appearance toward the outside where the brush contact with the casting roll surfaces <b>12</b>A becomes reduced. A clean band is the clean area formed by the contact of the brush <b>22</b> with the casting surface <b>12</b>A, not including the feathered portions. During the subsequent casting campaign, the clean band(s) provide the reference for the energy to be exerted by the main brush <b>22</b> against the casting roll surfaces <b>12</b> to keep the casting roll surfaces clean in accordance with the present invention. This alternative is particularly used where the energy of the rotating brush exerted against the casting rolls during the casting campaign is controlled by an operator observing the casting surfaces of the casting rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">To illustrate the cleaning done in accordance with the present invention, micrographs of textured casting roll surfaces <b>12</b>A are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 11</figref>. As shown, the casting roll surfaces are not pristine clean. There is residuals in the low areas and entices in the casting surface, and not even all exposed projections of the casting roll surface are effectively clean. However, a substantial number of the projections are visible with exposed surfaces as shown, and are cleaned sufficiently that the formation of crocodile skin roughness is inhibited if or eliminated during casting. By rotating brushes cleaning the casting roll surfaces as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, the casting roll surfaces <b>12</b>A can be wetted by the molten metal in the casting pool <b>10</b>, and heat flux can be effectively transmitted from the molten metal to the casting rolls when the casting surfaces are in contact with the casting pool while crocodile skin roughness is inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> are provided for purposes of comparison. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> show where the projections of the textured casting roll surface <b>12</b>A are “buried” beneath the molten melt and the casting surfaces are not exposed so that is effective heat flux from the molten metal to the casting roll surfaces in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">We have also found that the cleaning efficiency requires maintaining a relationship between the rotational speed of the cleaning brush of the sweeper brush and the casting speed with the caster. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a graph showing the relationship for a particular embodiment of the invention that has been built. Similar relationships can be empirically derived for other embodiments of the invention. This relationship provides for control of the energy of the brushes exerted against the casting surfaces to be maintained during the casting campaign.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is the control of the energy exerted by the brushes on the casting surface to control the formation of crocodile skin roughness can be done by manually controlling the hydraulic fluid flow through the hydraulic motors and the pressure differential of hydraulic fluid across the hydraulic motors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> reports two ladle sequence <b>2499</b>. In the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> represented as ‘A’ and ‘B,’ the hydraulic fluid flow through the two hydraulic motors is reported in gallons per minute as flow feedback from the flow meter, and in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> represented as ‘C’ and ‘D,’ the hydraulic pressure differential of hydraulic fluid across the two hydraulic motors is reported in Pascals. As shown, the energy exerted by the brushes on the casting surfaces was maintained within tolerances over the two ladle sequence, although through the brush rotational speed and hydraulic pressure across the hydraulic motors tended to wonder downwardly toward the end on the sequence within tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is the control of the energy exerted by the brushes on the casting surface to control the formation of crocodile skin roughness can be done by automated controls controlling the hydraulic fluid flow through the hydraulic motors and the pressure differential of hydraulic fluid across the hydraulic motors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> reports two ladle sequence <b>256</b>. In the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> represented as ‘A’ and ‘B,’ the hydraulic fluid flow through the two hydraulic motors is reported in gallons per minute as flow feedback from the flow meter, and in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> represented as ‘C’ and ‘D,’ the hydraulic pressure differential of hydraulic fluid across the two hydraulic motors is reported in Pascals. As shown, the energy exerted by the brushes on the casting surfaces was maintained very evenly over the two ladle sequence with the automated controls, and by contrast to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, within closer tolerances than with the manual controls of the energy exerted by the brushes on the casting rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Alternatively, the torque of the brush motor driving rotation of the cleaning brushes <b>22</b> and in turn the energy exerted by the cleaning brushes <b>22</b> against the respective casting surface of casting rolls <b>12</b> could be measured by strain gauges, load cell, or other device positioned adjacent the cleaning brush mounting structure or mounts for bearings <b>47</b> to measure the torque exerted by the cleaning brush <b>22</b> against the casting surfaces on the casting rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Although the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the foregoing drawings and description with reference to several embodiments, it should be understood that the description is illustrative and not restrictive in character, and that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. Rather, the present invention covers all variations, modifications and equivalent structures that come within the scope and spirit of the invention.
