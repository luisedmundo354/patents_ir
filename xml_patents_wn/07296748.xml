<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A bioptical laser scanning system employing a plurality of laser scanning stations about a two independently controlled rotating polygonal mirrors. The system has an ultra-compact construction, ideally suited for space-constrained retail scanning environments, and generates a 3-D omnidirectional laser scanning pattern between the bottom and side-scanning windows during system operation. The laser scanning pattern of the present invention comprises plurality of groups of intersecting laser scanning planes that form a complex omni-directional 3-D laser scanning pattern within a 3-D scanning volume capable of scanning a bar code symbol located on the surface of an object presented within the 3-D scanning volume at any orientation and from any direction at the POS station so as to provide 360° of omnidirectional bar code symbol scanning coverage at the POS station.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to laser scanners of ultra-compact design capable of reading bar code symbols in point-of-sale (POS) and other demanding scanning environments.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of bar code symbols for product and article identification is well known in the art. Presently, various types of bar code symbol scanners have been developed. In general, these bar code symbol readers can be classified into two distinct classes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first class of bar code symbol reader simultaneously illuminates all of the bars and spaces of a bar code symbol with light of a specific wavelength(s) in order to capture an image thereof for recognition and decoding purposes. Such scanners are commonly known as CCD scanners because they use CCD image detectors to detect images of the bar code symbols being read.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The second class of bar code symbol reader uses a focused light beam, typically a focused laser beam, to sequentially scan the bars and spaces of a bar code symbol to be read. This type of bar code symbol scanner is commonly called a “flying spot” scanner as the focused laser beam appears as “a spot of light that flies” across the bar code symbol being read. In general, laser bar code symbol scanners are sub-classified further by the type of mechanism used to focus and scan the laser beam across bar code symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The majority of laser scanners in use today, particular in retail environments, employ lenses and moving (i.e. rotating or oscillating) mirrors and/or other optical elements in order to focus and scan laser beams across bar code symbols during code symbol reading operations. In demanding retail scanning environments, it is common for such systems to have both bottom and side-scanning windows to enable highly aggressive scanner performance, whereby the cashier need only drag a bar coded product past these scanning windows for the bar code thereon to be automatically read with minimal assistance of the cashier or checkout personal. Such dual scanning window systems are typically referred to as “bioptical” laser scanning systems as such systems employ two sets of optics disposed behind the bottom and side-scanning windows thereof. Examples of polygon-based bioptical laser scanning systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,229,588 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,732, assigned to NCR, Inc., each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, prior art bioptical laser scanning systems are generally more aggressive that conventional single scanning window systems. For this reason, bioptical scanning systems are often deployed in demanding retail environments, such as supermarkets and high-volume department stores, where high check-out throughput is critical to achieving store profitability and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While prior art bioptical scanning systems represent a technological advance over most single scanning window system, prior art bioptical scanning systems in general suffered from various shortcomings and drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, the laser scanning patterns of such prior art bioptical laser scanning systems are not optimized in terms of scanning coverage and performance, and are generally expensive to manufacture by virtue of the large number of optical components presently required to constructed such laser scanning systems.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, there is a great need in the art for an improved bioptical-type laser scanning bar code symbol reading system, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of prior art laser scanning systems and methodologies.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, the performance of such aggressive laser scanning systems (in scanning a bar code symbol and accurately produce digital scan data signals representative of a scanned bar code symbol) is susceptible to noise, including ambient noise, thermal noise and paper noise. More specifically, during operation of such machines, a focused light beam is produced from a light source such as a visible laser diode (VLD), and repeatedly scanned across the elements of the code symbol attached, printed or otherwise fixed to the object to be identified. In the case of bar code scanning applications, the elements of the code symbol consists of a series of bar and space elements of varying width. For discrimination purposes, the bars and spaces have different light reflectivity (e.g. the spaces are highly light-reflective while the bars are highly light-absorptive). As the laser beam is scanned across the bar code elements, the bar elements absorb a substantial portion of the laser beam power, whereas the space elements reflective a substantial portion thereof. As a result of this scanning process, the intensity of the laser beam is modulated to in accordance with the information structure encoded within the scanned bar code symbol. As the laser beam is scanned across the bar code symbol, a portion of the reflected light beam is collected by optics within the scanner. The collected light signal is subsequently focused upon a photodetector within the scanner which generates an analog electrical output signal which can be decomposed into a number of signal components, namely a digital scan data signal having first and second signal levels, corresponding to the bars and spaces within the scanned code symbol; ambient-light noise produced as a result of ambient light collected by the light collection optics of the system; thermal noise produced as a result of thermal activity within the signal detecting and processing circuitry; and “paper” or substrate noise produced as a result of the microstructure of the substrate in relation to the cross-sectional dimensions of the focused laser scanning beam. The analog scan data signal has positive-going transitions and negative-going transitions which signify transitions between bars and spaces in the scanned bar code symbol. However, as a result of such noise components, the transitions from the first signal level to the second signal level and vice versa are not perfectly sharp, or instantaneous. Consequently, it is difficult to determine the exact instant that each binary signal level transition occurs in detected analog scan data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is well known that the ability of a scanner to accurately scan a bar code symbol and accurately produce digital scan data signals representative of a scanned bar code symbol in noisy environments depends on the depth of modulation of the laser scanning beam. The depth of modulation of the laser scanning beam, in turn, depends on several important factors, namely: the ratio of the laser beam cross-sectional dimensions at the scanning plane to the width of the minimal bar code element in the bar code symbol being scanned, and (ii) the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the scan data signal processing stage where binary level (1-bit) analog to digital (A/D) signal conversion occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As a practical matter, it is not possible in most instances to produce analog scan data signals with precisely-defined signal level transitions. Therefore, the analog scan data signal must be further processed to precisely determine the point at which the signal level transitions occur.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Hitherto, various circuits have been developed for carrying out such scan data signal processing operations. Typically, signal processing circuits capable of performing such operations include filters for removing unwanted noise components, and signal thresholding devices for rejecting signal components which do not exceed a predetermined signal level.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One very popular approach for converting analog scan data signals into digital scan data signals is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,000,397, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this U.S. Letters Patent, a method and apparatus are disclosed for precisely detecting the time of transitions between the binary levels of encoded analog scan data signals produced from various types of scanning devices. According to this prior art method, the first signal processing step involves double-differentiating the analog scan data input signal S<sub>analog </sub>to produce a second derivative signal S″<sub>analog</sub>. Then the zero-crossings of the second derivative signal are detected, during selected gating periods, to signify the precise time at which each transition between binary signal levels occurs. As taught in this U.S. patent, the selected gating periods are determined using a first derivative signal S′<sub>analog </sub>formed by differentiating the input scan data signal S<sub>analog</sub>. Whenever the first derivative signal S′<sub>analog </sub>exceeds a threshold level using peak-detection, the gating period is present and the second derivative signal S″<sub>analog </sub>is detected for zero-crossings. At each time instant when a second-derivative zero-crossing is detected, a binary signal level is produced at the output of the signal processor. The binary output signal level is a logical “1” when the detected signal level falls below the threshold at the gating interval, and a logical “0” when the detected signal level falls above the threshold at the gating interval. The output digital signal S<sub>digital </sub>produced by this signal processing technique corresponds to the digital scan data signal component contributing to the underlying structure of the analog scan data input signal S<sub>analog</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While the above-described signal processing technique generates a simple way of generating a digital scan data signal from a corresponding analog scan data signal, this method has a number of shortcomings and drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, thermal as well as “paper” or substrate noise imparted to the analog scan data input signal S<sub>analog </sub>tends to generate zero-crossings in the second-derivative signal S″<sub>analog </sub>in much the same manner as does binary signal level transitions encoded in the input analog scan data signal S<sub>analog</sub>. Consequently, the gating signal mechanism disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,000,397 allows “false” second-derivative zero-crossing signals to be passed onto the second-derivative zero-crossing detector thereof, thereby producing erroneous binary signal levels at the output stage of this prior art signal processor. In turn, error-ridden digital data scan data signals are transmitted to the digital scan data signal processor of the bar code scanner for conversion into digital words representative of the length of the binary signal levels in the digital scan data signal. This can result in significant errors during bar code symbol decoding operations, causing objects to be incorrectly identified and/or erroneous data to be entered into a host system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Also, when scanning bar code symbols within a large scanning field with multiple scanning planes that cover varying focal zones of the scanning field, as taught in co-applicant's PCT International Patent Publication No. WO 97/22945 published on Jun. 26, 1997, Applicants' have observed that the effects of paper/substrate noise are greatly amplified when scanning bar code symbols in the near focal zone(s), thereby causing a significant decrease in overall system performance. In the far out focal zones of the scanning system, Applicants have observed that laser beam spot speed is greatest and the analog scan data signals produced therefrom are time-compressed relative to analog scan data signals produced from bar code symbols scanned in focal zones closer to the scanning system. Thus, in such prior art laser scanning systems, Applicants' have provided, between the first and second differentiator stages of the scan data signal processor thereof, a low-pass filter (LHF) having cutoff frequency which passes (to the second differentiator stage) the spectral components of analog scan data signals produced when scanning bar code elements at the focal zone furthest out from the scanning system. While this technique has allowed prior art scanning systems to scan bar codes in the far focal zones of the system, it has in no way addressed or provided a solution to the problem of increased paper/substrate noise encountered when scanning bar code symbols in the near focal zones of such laser scanning systems.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, although filters and signal thresholding devices are useful for rejecting noise components in the analog scan signal, such devices also limit the scan resolution of the system, potentially rendering the system incapable of reading low contrast and high resolution bar code symbols on surfaces placed in the scanning field.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, there is a great need in the art for improved laser scanning system wherein the analog scan data signals generated therewithin are processed so that the effects of thermal and paper noise encountered within the system are significantly mitigated while not compromising the scan resolution of the system.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Referring to the figures in the accompanying Drawings, the various illustrative embodiments of the bioptical laser scanner of the present invention will be described in great detail.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In the illustrative embodiments, the apparatus of the present invention is realized in the form of an automatic code symbol reading system having a high-speed bioptical laser scanning mechanism as well as a scan data processor for decode processing scan data signals produced thereby. However, for the sake of convenience of expression, the term “bioptical laser scanner” shall be used hereinafter to denote the bar code symbol reading system which employs the bioptical laser scanning mechanism of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1G</figref>, the bioptical laser scanner <b>1</b> of the illustrative embodiment of the present invention has a compact housing <b>2</b> having a first housing portion <b>4</b>A and a second housing portion <b>4</b>B which projects from one end of the first housing portion <b>4</b>A in a substantially orthogonal manner. When the laser scanner <b>1</b> is installed within a counter-top surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, the first housing portion <b>4</b>A oriented horizontally, whereas the second housing portion <b>4</b>B is oriented vertically with respect to the POS station. Thus throughout the Specification and Claims hereof, the terms first housing portion and horizontally-disposed housing portion may be used interchangeably but refer to the same structure; likewise, the terms the terms second housing portion and vertically-disposed housing portion may be used interchangeably but refer to the same structure.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the illustrative embodiment, the first housing portion <b>4</b>A (which includes the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b>) has width, length and height dimensions of 11.405, 14.678 and 3.93 inches, respectively, whereas the second housing portion <b>4</b>B (which includes the side-scanning window <b>18</b>) has width and height dimensions of 12.558 inches and 7.115 inches, respectively. The total height of the scanner housing <b>2</b> is 11.044 inches. In addition, the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b> has width and length dimensions of approximately 3.94 inches (100 mm) and 5.9 inches (150 mm), respectively, to provide a window with a square area of approximately 15,000 square mm. And, the side-scanning window <b>18</b> has width and height dimensions of approximately 9.8 inches (248 mm) and 5.9 inches (150 mm), respectively, to provide a window with a square area of approximately 37,200 square mm. As will be described in greater detail below, the bioptical laser scanning mechanism housed within this ultra-compact housing produces an omni-directional laser scanning pattern within the three-dimensional volume above the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b> and in front of the side-scanning window <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The omni-directional scanning pattern is capable of reading picket-fence type bar code symbols on bottom-facing surfaces (i.e., a surface whose normal is directed toward the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b> of the scanner), top-facing surfaces (i.e., a surface whose “flip-normal” is directed toward the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b> of the scanner), back-facing surfaces (i.e., a surface whose normal is directed toward the side-scanning window <b>18</b> of the scanner), front-facing surfaces (i.e., a surface whose “flip-normal” is directed toward the side-scanning window <b>18</b> of the scanner), left-facing surfaces (i.e., a surface whose normal is directed toward or above the left side of the scanner), and right-facing surfaces (i.e., a surface whose normal is directed toward or above the right side of the scanner). A “flip-normal” as used above is a direction co-linear to the normal of a surface yet opposite in direction to this normal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1J</figref>. An example of such bottom-facing, top-facing, back-facing, front-facing surfaces, left-facing surfaces, and right-facing surfaces of a rectangular shaped article oriented in the scan volume of the bioptical laser scanning system disposed between bottom-scanning and side-scanning windows of the system is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1K</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The bioptical laser scanning system of the present invention can be used in a diverse variety of bar code symbol scanning applications. For example, the bioptical laser scanner <b>1</b> can be installed within the countertop of a point-of-sale (POS) station as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>. In this application, it is advantageous to integrate a weight scale with the laser scanning mechanism. Such a device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref> including a weight transducer <b>35</b> affixed to a flange <b>37</b> mounted to the front side of the first housing portion <b>4</b>A. A weigh platter <b>31</b> (upon which goods or articles to be weighed are placed) is mechanically supported via posts (preferably disposed on its periphery) to a plastic insert <b>33</b>. The posts (not shown) and plastic insert <b>33</b> transfer the weight forces exerted by the goods or articles placed on the weigh platter <b>31</b> to the weight transducer <b>35</b> for measurement. In addition, the plastic insert <b>33</b> supports the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, the bioptical laser scanner <b>1</b> can be installed within the countertop of a point-of-sale (POS) station <b>26</b>, having a computer-based cash register <b>20</b>, a weigh-scale <b>22</b> mounted within the counter adjacent the laser scanner, and an automated transaction terminal (ATM) supported upon a courtesy stand in a conventional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref>, the bioptical laser scanner can be installed above a conveyor belt structure as part of a manually-assisted parcel sorting operation being carried out, for example, during inventory control and management operations.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2F</figref>, the bioptical scanning system <b>1</b> of the illustrative embodiment includes two sections: a first section (sometimes referred to as the horizontal section) disposed within the first housing portion <b>4</b>A and a second section (sometimes referred to as the vertical section) substantially disposed within the second housing portion <b>4</b>B. It should be noted that in the illustrative embodiment, parts of the vertical section are disposed within the back of the first housing portion <b>4</b>A as will become evident from the figures and accompanying description that follows.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As shown in FIGS. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>C<b>2</b> (and in tables I and II below), the first section includes a first rotating polygonal mirror, and first and second scanning stations (indicated by HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b>, respectively) disposed thereabout. The first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b> each include a laser beam production module (not shown), a set of laser beam folding mirrors, a light collecting/focusing mirror; and a photodetector. The first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b> are disposed opposite one another about the first rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b>. Each laser scanning station generates a laser scanning beam (shown as SB<b>1</b> and SB<b>2</b> in FIGS. <b>2</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>C<b>2</b>) that is directed to a different point of incidence on the first rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b>. The incident laser beams (produced by the first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b>) are reflected by each facet (of the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b>) at varying angles as the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b> rotates to produce two scanning beams (SB<b>1</b> and SB<b>2</b>) whose direction varies over the rotation cycle of the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b>. The first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b> include groups of laser beam folder mirrors arranged about the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b> so as to redirect the two scanning beams SB<b>1</b> and SB<b>2</b> to thereby generate and project different groups of laser scanning planes through the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, as shown in FIGS. <b>2</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>C<b>2</b>, the first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b> each include a light collecting/focusing optical element, e.g. parabolic light collecting mirror or parabolic surface emulating volume reflection hologram (labeled LC<sub>HST1 </sub>and LC<sub>HST2</sub>) that collects light from a scan region that encompasses the outgoing scanning planes (produced by the first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b>) and focuses such collected light onto a photodetector (labeled PD<sub>HST1 </sub>and PD<sub>HST2</sub>), which produces an electrical signal whose amplitude is proportional to the intensity of light focused thereon. The electrical signal produced by the photodetector is supplied to analog/digital signal processing circuitry, associated with the first and second laser scanning station HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b>, that process analog and digital scan data signals derived therefrom to perform bar code symbol reading operations. Preferably, the first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b> each include a laser beam production module (not shown) that generates a laser scanning beam (labeled SB<b>1</b> and SB<b>2</b>) that is directed (preferably through an aperture in the corresponding light collecting/focusing element as shown in FIGS. <b>2</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>C<b>2</b>) to a point of incidence on the first rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D through 2F</figref> and in tables III and IV below, the second section includes a second rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> and a third scanning station (denoted VST<b>1</b>) that includes a laser beam production module (not shown), a set of laser beam folding mirrors, a light collecting/focusing mirror, and a photodetector. The third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b> generates a laser scanning beam (labeled as SB<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>) that is directed to a point of incidence on the second rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b>. The incident laser beam is reflected by each facet (of the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b>) at varying angles as the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> rotates to produce a scanning beam whose direction varies over the rotation cycle of the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b>. The third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b> includes a set of laser beam folder mirrors arranged about the second rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> so as to redirect the scanning beam to thereby generate and project different groups of laser scanning planes through the side-scanning window <b>18</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b> includes a light collecting/focusing optical element, e.g. parabolic light collecting mirror or parabolic surface emulating volume reflection hologram (labeled LC<sub>VST1</sub>) that collects light from a scan region that encompasses the outgoing scanning planes (produced by the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b>) and focuses such collected light onto a photodetector (labeled PD<sub>VST1</sub>), which produces an electrical signal whose amplitude is proportional to the intensity of light focused thereon. The electrical signal produced by the photodetector is supplied to analog/digital signal processing circuitry, associated with the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b>, that process analog and digital scan data signals derived therefrom to perform bar code symbol reading operations. Preferably, the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b> includes a laser beam production module (not shown) that generates a laser scanning beam SB<b>3</b> that is directed to a small light directing mirror disposed in the interior of the light collecting/focusing element LC<sub>VST1</sub>, which redirects the laser scanning beam SB<b>3</b> to a point of incidence on the second rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the illustrative embodiment, the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b> includes 4 facets that are used in conjunction with the two independent laser beam sources provided by the first and second laser scanning stations HST<b>1</b> and HST<b>2</b> so as project from the bottom-scanning window an omni-directional laser scanning pattern consisting of 40 laser scanning planes that are cyclically generated as the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b> rotates. Moreover, the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> includes 4 facets that are used in conjunction with the independent laser beam source provided by the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b> so as to project from the side-scanning window an omni-directional laser scanning pattern consisting of 28 laser scanning planes cyclically generated as the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> rotates. Thus, the bioptical laser scanning system of the illustrative embodiment project from the bottom and side-scanning windows an omni-directional laser scanning pattern consisting of 68 laser scanning planes cyclically generated as the first and second polygonal mirrors PM<b>1</b> and PM<b>2</b> rotate. It is understood, however, these number may vary from embodiment to embodiment of the present invention and thus shall not form a limitation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">FIG. <b>2</b>G<b>1</b> depicts the angle of each facet of the rotating polygonal mirrors PM<b>1</b> and PM<b>2</b> with respect to the rotational axis of the respective rotating polygonal mirrors in this illustrative embodiment. The scanning ray pattern produced by the four facets of the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b> in conjunction with the laser beam source provided by the first laser scanning station HST<b>1</b> in the illustrative embodiment is shown in FIG. <b>2</b>G<b>2</b>. A similar scanning ray pattern is produced by the four facets of the first polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b> in conjunction with the laser beam source provided by the second laser scanning station HST<b>2</b>. In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the second rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> has two different types of facets based on beam elevation angle characteristics of the facet. The scanning ray pattern produced by the four facets of the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> in conjunction with the laser beam source provided by the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b> in the illustrative embodiment is shown in FIG. <b>2</b>G<b>3</b>. The facets of the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b> can be partitioned into two classes: a first class of facets (corresponding to angles β<sub>1 </sub>and β<sub>2</sub>) have High Elevation (HE) angle characteristics, and a second class of facets (corresponding to angles β<sub>3 </sub>and β<sub>4</sub>) have Low Elevation (LE) angle characteristics. As shown in FIG. <b>2</b>G<b>2</b>, high and low elevation angle characteristics are referenced by the plane P<b>1</b> that contains the incoming laser beam and is normal to the rotational axis of the second polygonal mirror PM<b>2</b>. Each facet in the first class of facets (having high beam elevation angle characteristics) produces an outgoing laser beam that is directed above the plane P<b>1</b> as the facet sweeps across the point of incidence of the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b>. Whereas each facet in the second class of facets (having low beam elevation angle characteristics) produces an outgoing laser beam that is directed below the plane P<b>1</b> as the facet sweeps across the point of incidence of the third laser scanning station VST<b>1</b>. As will become apparent hereinafter, the use of scanning facets having such diverse elevation angle characteristics enables an efficient design and construction of the second section of the bioptical laser scanning—the plurality of beam folding mirrors used therein can be compactly arranged within a minimized region of volumetric space. Such efficient space saving designs are advantageous in space-constricted POS-type scanning applications.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the first laser scanning station (HST<b>1</b>) includes four groups of laser beam folding mirrors (GH<b>1</b>, GH<b>2</b>, GH<b>3</b>, and GH<b>4</b> as depicted in Table II above) which are arranged about the first rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b>, and cooperate with the four scanning facets of the first rotating polygonal mirror PM<b>1</b> so as to generate and project four different groups of laser scanning planes (with 20 total scanning planes in the four groups) through the bottom-scanning window <b>16</b>, as graphically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3G</figref>.

A portion of this laser light is reflected back along the outgoing ray (optical) path, off the same group of beam folding mirrors employed during the corresponding laser beam generation process, and thereafter is incident on the same scanning facet (of the first or second rotating polygonal mirror) that generated the corresponding scanning plane only a short time before. The scanning facet directs the returning reflected laser light towards a light collecting optical element (e.g., parabolic mirror structure) of the respective laser scanning station, which collects the returning light and focuses these collected light rays onto a photodetector, which may be disposed on a planar surface beneath the respective scanning polygon (as shown in FIGS. <b>2</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>C<b>2</b>), or which may be disposed on a planar surface above the respective scanning polygon (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>).

<p id="p-0187" num="0186">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, the bottom and side-scanning windows <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> have light transmission apertures of substantially planar extent. In order to seal off the optical components of the scanning system from dust, moisture and the like, the scanning windows <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, are preferably fabricated from a high impact plastic material and installed over their corresponding light transmission apertures using a rubber gasket and conventional mounting techniques. In the illustrative embodiment, each scanning window <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> preferably has spectrally-selective light transmission characteristics which, in conjunction with a spectrally-selective filters installed before each photodetector within the housing, forms a narrow-band spectral filtering subsystem that performs two different functions. The first function of the narrow-band spectral filtering subsystem is to transmit only the optical wavelengths in the red region of the visible spectrum in order to impart a reddish color or semi-transparent character to the scanning window. This makes the internal optical components less visible and thus remarkably improves the external appearance of the bioptical laser scanning system. This feature also makes the bioptical laser scanner less intimidating to customers at point-of-sale (POS) stations where it may be used. The second function of the narrow-band spectral filtering subsystem is to transmit to the photodetector for detection, only the narrow band of spectral components comprising the outgoing laser beam produced by the associated laser beam production module. Details regarding this optical filtering subsystem are disclosed in copending application Ser.

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Electrical Subsystem</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, the bioptical laser scanning system <b>1</b> comprises a number of system components as shown in the system diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, including: photodetectors (e.g. a silicon photocell) for detection of optical scan data signals generated by the respective laser scanning stations; analog signal processing circuitry for processing (e.g., preamplification, bandpass filtering, and A/D conversion) analog scan data signals, digitizing circuitry for converting the digital scan data signal D<sub>2</sub>, associated with each scanned bar code symbol, into a corresponding sequence of digital words (i.e. a sequence of digital count values) D<sub>3</sub>, and bar code symbol decoding circuitry that receives the digital word sequences D<sub>3 </sub>produced from the digitizing circuit, and subject it to one or more bar code symbol decoding algorithms in order to determine which bar code symbol is indicated (i.e. represented) by the digital word sequence D<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">As described above, during laser scanning operations, the optical scan data signal D<sub>0 </sub>focused onto the photodetectors <b>45</b>A <b>45</b>B, and <b>45</b>C is produced by light rays associated with a diffracted laser beam being scanned across a light reflective surface (e.g. the bars and spaces of a bar code symbol) and scattering thereof, whereupon the polarization state distribution of the scattered light rays is typically altered when the scanned surface exhibits diffuse reflective characteristics. Thereafter, a portion of the scattered light rays are reflected along the same outgoing light ray paths toward the facet which produced the scanned laser beam. These reflected light rays are collected by the scanning facet and ultimately focused onto the photodetector by its parabolic light reflecting mirror. The function of each photodetector is to detect variations in the amplitude (i.e. intensity) of optical scan data signal D<sub>0</sub>, and produce in response thereto an electrical analog scan data signal D<sub>1 </sub>which corresponds to such intensity variations. When a photodetector with suitable light sensitivity characteristics is used, the amplitude variations of electrical analog scan data signal D<sub>1 </sub>will linearly correspond to light reflection characteristics of the scanned surface (e.g. the scanned bar code symbol). The function of the analog signal processing circuitry is to amplify and band-pass filter the electrical analog scan data signal D<sub>1</sub>, in order to improve the SNR of the analog signal, and convert the analog signal into digital form (e.g., a pulse train with transitions between high and low logic levels). In practice, this analog to digital conversion is a thresholding function which converts the electrical analog scan data signal D<sub>1 </sub>into a corresponding digital scan data signal D<sub>2 </sub>having first and second (i.e. binary) signal levels which correspond to the bars and spaces of the bar code symbol being scanned. Thus, the digital scan data signal D<sub>2 </sub>appears as a pulse-width modulated type signal as the first and second signal levels vary in proportion to the width of bars and spaces in the scanned bar code symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The digitizing circuitry converts the digital scan data signal D<sub>2</sub>, associated with each scanned bar code symbol, into a corresponding sequence of digital words (i.e. a sequence of digital count values) D<sub>3</sub>. Notably, in the digital word sequence D<sub>3</sub>, each digital word represents the time length associated with each first or second signal level in the corresponding digital scan data signal D<sub>2</sub>. Preferably, these digital count values are in a suitable digital format for use in carrying out various symbol decoding operations which, like the scanning pattern and volume of the present invention, will be determined primarily by the particular scanning application at hand. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,343,027 to Knowles, incorporated herein by reference, as it provides technical details regarding the design and construction of microelectronic digitizing circuits suitable for use in the laser scanner of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The bar code symbol decoding circuitry receive each digital word sequence D<sub>3 </sub>produced from the digitizing circuit, and subject it to one or more bar code symbol decoding algorithms in order to determine which bar code symbol is indicated (i.e. represented) by the digital word sequence D<sub>3</sub>, originally derived from corresponding scan data signal D<sub>1 </sub>detected by the photodetector associated therewith. In more general scanning applications, the function of the programmed decode computer is to receive each digital word sequence D<sub>3 </sub>produced from the digitizing circuit, and subject it to one or more pattern recognition algorithms (e.g. character recognition algorithms) in order to determine which pattern is indicated by the digital word sequence D<sub>3</sub>. In bar code symbol reading applications, in which scanned code symbols can be any one of a number of symbologies, a bar code symbol decoding algorithm with auto-discrimination capabilities can be used in a manner known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the system includes a programmed microprocessor <b>61</b> with a system bus and associated program and data storage memory, for controlling the system operation of the bioptical laser scanner and performing other auxiliary functions and for receiving bar code symbol character data (provided by the bar code symbol decoding circuitry); a data transmission subsystem for interfacing with and transmitting symbol character data and other information to host computer system (e.g. central computer, cash register, etc.) over a communication link therebetween; and an input/output interface for providing drive signals to an audio-transducer and/or LED-based visual indicators used to signal successful symbol reading operations to users and the like, for providing user input via interaction with a keypad, and for interfacing with a plurality of accessory devices (such as an external handheld scanner that transmits bar code symbol character data to the bioptical laser scanning system, a display device, a weight scale, a magnetic card reader and/or a coupon printer as shown). In addition, the input-output interface may provide a port that enables an external handheld scanner to transmit sequences of digital words D<sub>3 </sub>(i.e. a sequence of digital count values) generated therein to the bioptical laser scanning system for bar code symbol decoding operations. Details of such an interface port are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,717 to Knowles et al., commonly assigned to the assignee of the present invention, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The communication link between the data transmission subsystem and the host system may be a wireless data link (such as an infra-red link, Bluetooth RF link or IEEE 802.11a or 802.11b RF link) or wired serial data link (such as keyboard wedge link—for example supporting XT-, AT- and PS/2-style keyboard protocols, an RS-232 link, USB link, a Firewire (or IEEE 1394) link, an RS-422 link, and RS485 link), a wired parallel data bus, or other common wired interface links (such as an OCIA link, IBM 46XX link, Light Pen Emulation link, LTPN link). Similarly, the input/output interface between the external handheld scanner and the bioptical laser scanning system may support a wireless data link (such as an infra-red link, Bluetooth RF link or IEEE 802.11a or 802.11b RF link) or wired serial data link (such as keyboard wedge link—for example supporting XT-, AT- and PS/2-style keyboard protocols, an RS-232 link, USB link, a Firewire (or IEEE 1394) link, an RS-422 link, and RS-485 link), a wired parallel data bus, or other common wired interface links (such as an OCIA link, IBM 46XX link, Light Pen Emulation link, LTPN link).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The microprocessor also produces motor control signals, and laser control signals during system operation. These control signals as well as a 120 Volt, 60 Hz line voltage signal from an external power source (such as a standard power distribution circuit) are received as input by a power regulation circuit, which produces as output, (1) laser source enable signals to drive VLDs <b>153</b>A, <b>153</b>B, <b>153</b>C, and <b>153</b>D, respectively, and (2) motor enable signals in order to drive the two motors (motor <b>1</b> and motor <b>2</b>) that cause rotation of the first and second rotating polygonal mirrors, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In some scanning applications, where omni-directional scanning cannot be ensured at all regions within a pre-specified scanning volume, it may be useful to use scan data produced either (i) from the same laser scanning plane reproduced many times over a very short time duration while the code symbol is being scanned therethrough, or (ii) from several different scanning planes spatially contiguous within a pre-specified portion of the scanning volume. In the first instance, if the bar code symbol is moved through a partial region of the scanning volume, a number of partial scan data signal fragments associated with the moved bar code symbol can be acquired by a particular scanning plane being cyclically generated over an ultra-short period of time (e.g. 1-3 milliseconds), thereby providing sufficient scan data to read the bar code symbol. In the second instance, if the bar code symbol is within the scanning volume, a number of partial scan data signal fragments associated with the bar code symbol can be acquired by several different scanning planes being simultaneously generated by the three laser scanning stations of the system hereof, thereby providing sufficient scan data to read the bar code symbol, that is, provided such scan data can be identified and collectively gathered at a particular decode processor for symbol decoding operations.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In order to allow the bioptical scanning system of the present invention to use symbol decoding algorithms that operate upon partial scan data signal fragments, as described above, a synchronizing signal can be used to identify a set of digital word sequences D<sub>3</sub>, (i.e. {D<sub>S</sub>}), associated with a set of time-sequentially generated laser scanning beams produced by a particular facet on the first and second rotating polygonal mirrors. In such applications, each set of digital word sequences can be used to decode a partially scanned code symbol and produce symbol character data representative of the scanned code symbol. In code symbol reading applications where complete scan data signals are used to decode scanned code symbols, the synchronizing signal described above need not be used, as the digital word sequence D<sub>3 </sub>corresponding to the completely scanned bar code symbol is sufficient to carry out symbol decoding operations using conventional symbol decoding algorithms known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The synchronizing signal can be derived from a position sensor (such as a hall sensor), integrated into the rotating shaft (or other portion) of the rotating polygonal mirror, that generates an electrical signal when the rotating polygonal mirror reaches a predetermined point (such as a start-of-scan position) in its rotation. Alternatively, such synchronization may be derived from a position indicating optical element (e.g., mirror or lens), which is preferably mounted adjacent (or near) the perimeter of one of the light folding mirrors, such that the position indicating optical element is illuminated by the scanning beam when the rotating polygonal mirror reaches a predetermined point (such as a start-of-scan position) in its rotation. The position indicating optical element may be a mirror that directs the illumination of the scanning beam incident thereon to a position indicating optical detector (which generates an electrical signal whose amplitude corresponds to the intensity of light incident thereon). Alternatively, the position indicating optical element may be a light collecting lens that is operably coupled to a light guide (such as a fiber optic bundle) that directs the illumination of the scanning beam incident thereon to a position indicating optical detector (which generates an electrical signal whose amplitude corresponds to the intensity of light incident thereon).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As each synchronizing pulse in the synchronizing signal is synchronous with a “reference” point on the respective rotating mirror, the symbol decoding circuitry provided with this periodic signal can readily “link up” or relate, on a real-time basis, such partial scan data signal fragments with the particular facet on the respective rotating polygonal mirror that generated the partial scan data fragment. By producing both a scan data signal and a synchronizing signal as described above, the bioptical laser scanning system of the present invention can readily carry out a diverse repertoire of symbol decoding processes which use partial scan data signal fragments during the symbol reading process.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The bioptical laser scanning system of the present invention can be modified in various ways. For example, more (or less) groups of beam folding mirrors can be used in each laser scanning station within the system and/or more or less facets can be used for the rotating polygonal mirrors, Such modifications will add (or remove) scanning planes from the system.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Also more or less laser scanning stations might be employed within the system. Such modifications might be practiced in order to provide an omnidirectional laser scanning pattern having scanning performance characteristics optimized for a specialized scanning application.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">While the second rotating polygonal mirror of the illustrative embodiment employs facets having low and high elevation angle characteristics, it is understood that it might be desirable in particular applications to use scanning facets with different characteristics (such as varying angular reflection characteristics) so as to enable a compact scanner design in a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Also, it is contemplated that each laser scanning station may not have its own laser source (e.g., VLD). More specifically, as is well known in the scanning art, the laser light produced by a laser source (VLD) may be split into multiple beams (with a beam splitter) and directed to multiple laser scanning stations with mirrors, a light pipe or other light directing optical element</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">While the various embodiments of the bioptical laser scanner hereof have been described in connection with linear (1-D) bar code symbol scanning applications, it should be clear, however, that the scanning apparatus and methods of the present invention are equally suited for scanning 2-D bar code symbols, as well as alphanumeric characters (e.g. textual information) in optical character recognition (OCR) applications, as well as scanning graphical images in graphical scanning arts.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Improved Scan Signal Processing</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In any laser scanning system (including the various embodiments of the bioptical laser scanner described above), the primary function of the laser scanning mechanism is to produce a laser scanning field (or volume) in which bar code symbols can be scanned in a reliable manner. In such systems, the speed of the laser beam spot (or cross-section) along the extent of the scanned laser beam will vary over the depth of the scanning range of the system. The further the laser beam spot is away from the laser scanning mechanism, the greater the laser beam spot speed with be, based on well known principles of physics. A useful measure of such beam spot speed variation is given by the ratio of (i) the maximum laser beam spot speed within the scanning field of the system, to (ii) the minimum laser beam spot speed in the scanning system. Hereinafter, this spot speed variation measure shall be referred to as the “Max/Min Beam Spot Speed Ratio” of a laser scanning system.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The substrate, usually paper, on which a bar code is printed reflects a signal of varying power when scanned with a focused laser beam within a given focal zone in the system. The laser light energy reflected (i.e. scattered) off the scanned code symbol is directed onto a photodetector by way of light collection and focusing optics. The photodetector converts these optical signals into corresponding electrical signals. The signal components produced by scanning the bar code substrate are unwanted and therefore are described as noise. Since the substrate is usually paper, consisting of fibers having a random spatial structure, such unwanted noise signals are commonly referred to as paper or substrate noise. A signal derived from the output of the photodetector (in analog or digital form) is referred to as a scan data signal S<sub>analog </sub>comprising the desired bar code signal component as well as the paper noise components.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">As a bar code is scanned within a focal zone disposed further away from the scanner, the scan data signal is increasingly compressed on the time-domain by virtue of the fact that the laser beam speed increases as a function of distance away from the laser scanning mechanism. In accordance with Fourier Analysis principles, compression of the scan data signal (including its noise components) represented on the time-domain results in an increase in or shift of power to the higher spectral components of the scan data signal represented on the frequency-domain. Thus, the frequency spectra of the scan data signal (including its noise components) undergoes a positive frequency shift as the corresponding bar code symbol is scanned further away from the laser scanning system. This phenomenon is graphically illustrated in the analog scan data signal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">When scanning bar code symbols in a multi-focal zone laser scanning system, filters and signal thresholding devices are useful for rejecting noise components in the scan data signal. However, such devices also limit the scan resolution of the system, potentially rendering the system incapable of reading low contrast and high resolution bar code symbols on surfaces placed in the scanning field. Thus, it is imperative that the bandwidth of the system be sufficient to support the spectral components of scan data signals at different focal zones of the system and to support the scanning of the desired resolution of bar code symbols on surfaces placed in the scanning field.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">In accordance with teachings of the present invention, a laser scanning system (such as the bioptical laser scanning system of the present invention as described above) includes a multi-path scan data signal processor having multiple signal processing paths. Each signal processing path processes the same data signal (which is derived from the output of a photodetector) to detect bar code symbols therein and generate data representing the bar code symbols. And each signal processing path has different operational characteristics (such as low-pass filter cutoff frequencies, amplifier gain characteristics, and/or positive and negative signal thresholds). The varying operational characteristics of the paths are optimized to provide different signal processing functions (e.g., minimize paper noise, or maximize the scan resolution of the system). The data signal derived from laser scanning is supplied to each path of the multi-path scan data processor, where it is processed (preferably in parallel) to identify signal level transitions therein. A digital scan data signal that encodes such signal level transitions is provided to digitizing circuitry, which converts the digital scan data signal into a corresponding sequence of digital words (i.e. a sequence of digital count values) suitable for bar code symbol decoding as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">By virtue of the present invention, it is now possible to identify signal level transitions in the scan data signal over a diverse range of operating conditions (e.g., operating conditions where paper noise is present in addition to operating conditions requiring high resolution scanning, such as the reading of low contrast or high resolution bar code symbols), which enables more reliable bar code reading over such diverse operating conditions. These and other advantages of the present invention will become apparent hereinafter.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Analog Scan Data Signal Processor of the Illustrative Embodiment of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a multi-path scan data signal processor <b>901</b> according to the present invention comprises a number of subcomponents, namely: signal conditioning circuitry <b>903</b> operably coupled between a photodetector <b>902</b> and a plurality of signal processing paths (two shown as path A and path B) that process the output of the signal conditioning circuitry in parallel. Each signal processing path includes: a first derivative signal generation circuit <b>904</b> having a differentiator, low pass filter and amplifier therein; a second derivative signal generation circuit <b>906</b> having a differentiator therein; a first derivative signal threshold-level generation circuit <b>905</b>; and a zero crossing detector <b>907</b>, data gate <b>908</b>, and binary-type A/D signal conversion circuitry <b>909</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The signal conditioning circuitry <b>903</b> operates to smooth out or otherwise filter the scan data signal produced by the photodetector <b>902</b> to remove unwanted noise components therein, and possibly amplify such signal. An illustrative implementation of such signal conditioning circuitry is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. The output of the signal conditioning circuitry <b>903</b> is provided to the plurality of signal processing paths (two shown as path A and path B) that process the output of the signal conditioning circuitry <b>903</b> in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The first derivative signal generation circuitry <b>904</b> in each respective path (labeled <b>904</b>-A and <b>904</b>-B in as shown) includes a differentiator, low pass filter and amplifier that generate a signal approximating the first derivative of the analog scan data signal (with unwanted noise components removed). The low pass filter may be implemented with passive elements (such as resistors, capacitors and inductors) or may be implemented with active elements (such as an operational amplifier). Preferably, the low-pass filter implements one of a Butterworth-type, Chebsychev-type, MFTD-type, or elliptical-type low pass filtering transfer function, which are well known in the filtering art. Details of the design of such filters is set forth in the book entitled “Electrical Filter Design Handbook,” Third Edition, by A. Williams et al., McGraw-Hill, 1996, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. An illustrative implementation of the first derivative signal generation circuitry <b>904</b> for two different paths is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The “first derivative signal” is supplied to second derivative signal generation circuit <b>906</b> and to first derivative threshold circuitry <b>905</b> in the respective path. The second derivative signal generation circuitry in each respective path (labeled <b>906</b>-A and <b>906</b>-B as shown) includes a differentiator that generates a signal approximating the second derivative of the scan data signal (with unwanted noise components removed). An example of the second derivative signal generation circuitry is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The “second derivative signal” is supplied to a zero crossing detector <b>907</b> that produces output signal(s) (“zero crossing signal”) identifying zero crossings in the second derivative signal. An illustrative implementation of the zero crossing detector in each respective path (labeled <b>907</b>-A and <b>907</b>-B) is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The first derivative threshold circuitry in each respective path (labeled <b>905</b>-A and <b>905</b>-B) operates as a positive and negative peak detector to provide output signals that indicate the approximate time periods when the positive and negative peaks of the first derivative signal provided thereto exceed predetermined thresholds (i.e., a positive peak level PPL and a negative peak level NPL). An illustrative implementation of such first derivative threshold circuitry <b>905</b> for the two different paths is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A through 14C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In the absence of noise, the occurrence of each second derivative zero-crossing indicates that the “first derivative signal” is undergoing a (positive or negative) peak which corresponds to the point in the scan data signal where a signal level transition (e.g., indicative of a transition between a space and a bar in a bar code symbol) has occurred. However, in the real-world, noise is notorious for producing false zero-crossing detections within the second derivative zero-crossing detection circuit. To reduce the number of “falsely detected” zero-crossings produced by noise, data gating circuit <b>908</b> is provided, which functions to gate to the binary-type A/D signal conversion circuitry <b>909</b>, only detected second derivative zero-crossings which occur substantially concurrent to a positive or negative peak detected in the “first derivative signal” (as identified by the outputs signals of the first derivative threshold circuitry <b>905</b>). An example of the data gate circuitry and binary-type A/D signal conversion circuitry is described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The output of the binary-type A/D conversion circuitry <b>909</b> is a digital scan data signal D<sub>2 </sub>having first and second (i.e. binary) signal levels which correspond to the bars and spaces of the bar code symbol being scanned. Thus, the digital scan data signal D<sub>2 </sub>appears as a pulse-width modulated type signal as the first and second signal levels vary in proportion to the width of bars and spaces in the scanned bar code symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The digital scan data signal D<sub>2 </sub>is supplied to digitizing circuitry, which converts the digital scan data signal D<sub>2</sub>, associated with each scanned bar code symbol, into a corresponding sequence of digital words (i.e. a sequence of digital count values) D<sub>3</sub>. Notably, in the digital word sequence D<sub>3</sub>, each digital word represents the time length associated with each first or second signal level in the corresponding digital scan data signal D<sub>2</sub>. Preferably, these digital count values are in a suitable digital format for use in carrying out various symbol decoding operations which, like the scanning pattern and volume of the present invention, will be determined primarily by the particular scanning application at hand. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,343,027 to Knowles, incorporated herein by reference, as it provides technical details regarding the design and construction of microelectronic digitizing circuits suitable for use in the laser scanner of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The operation of the multi-path scan data signal processor <b>901</b> is illustrated by the signal diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A through 10I</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> depict the signal produced at the output of the photodetector <b>902</b> as the laser scanning beam scans across a bar code symbol. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> depicts the output signal produced by the signal conditioning circuitry <b>903</b>. And <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10D through 10I</figref> depict the processing performed in one of the respective paths of the multi-path scan data signal processor <b>901</b>. Similar processing operations with different operations characteristics are performed in other paths of the multi-path scan data signal processor <b>901</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">More specifically, each signal processing path has different operational characteristics (such as different cutoff frequencies in the filtering stages of the first and second derivative signal generation circuits of the respective paths, different gain characteristics in amplifier stages of the first and second derivative signal generation circuits of the respective paths, and/or different positive and negative signal thresholds in the first derivative threshold circuitry of the respective paths). The varying operational characteristics of the paths are optimized to provide different signal processing functions.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">For example, the cut-off frequencies in the filtering stages of the first and second derivative signal generation circuits of the respective paths can vary such that different paths minimize the paper noise originating from different focal zones of the system. Alternatively, such cut-off frequencies can vary such that one or more paths maximize the scan resolution of the system (i.e., a path with higher cutoff frequencies may be able to detect high resolution bar code symbols) while other paths minimize paper noise (i.e., a path with lower cutoff frequencies will reject paper noise from a larger frequency band above the selected cutoff frequencies).</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In another example, the gain characteristics in the amplifier stages of the first and second derivative signal generation circuits of the paths and/or the positive and negative signal thresholds in the first derivative threshold circuitry of the paths can vary such that one or more paths maximize the scan resolution of the system (i.e., a path with higher gain and/or smaller positive and negative signal thresholds may be able to detect low bar code symbols) while other paths minimize paper noise (i.e., a path with lower gain and/or larger positive and negative signal thresholds will reject paper noise that falls below such thresholds).</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The different signal processing functions of each path of the multi-path scan data processor as described above are preferably performed in parallel. Alternatively, the processing along each path may be performed sequentially. In this case, a programmable microcomputer may be programmed to dynamically activate the processing of a given path based upon the operation of the scanner (for example, based upon the focal distance of the scanning plane from which the scan data signal is derived, which is described in detail in U.S. application Ser. No. (09/501,903), or based upon results of previous scan processing of the system).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">By virtue of this improved architecture, the multi-path scan data signal processor is able to identify signal level transitions (corresponding to transitions between a space and a bar in a bar code symbol) in the scan data signal over a diverse range of operating conditions (e.g., operating conditions where paper noise is present in addition to operating conditions requiring high resolution scanning, such as the reading of low contrast or high resolution bar code symbols), which enables more reliable bar code reading over such diverse operating conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Having described illustrative embodiments of the present invention, it is understood that there a number of alternative ways to practice the present invention. Several different modes for carrying out the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">For example, rather than using “analog-type” circuit technology for realizing the signal processing subcomponents of the multi-path scan data signal processor (e.g., the differentiators, low-pass filter, amplifiers, peak detectors, data gate, etc.), it is understood that the scan data signal processing method and apparatus of the present invention can be implemented using digital signal processing techniques carried out either within a programmed microcomputer or using one or more custom or commercially available digital signal processing (DSP) chips known in the digital signal processing art.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, when carrying out a digital implementation of the scan data signal processor of the present invention, the analog scan data signal D<sub>1 </sub>is provided to signal conditioning circuitry <b>1703</b> (which amplifies and filters the signal to remove unwanted noise components as described above), whose output is provided to analog-to-digital conversion circuitry <b>1705</b>. The analog-to-digital conversion circuitry <b>1705</b> samples the conditioned analog scan data signals at a sampling frequency at least two times the highest frequency component expected in the analog scan data signal, in accordance with the well known Nyquist criteria, and quantizes each time-sampled scan data signal value into a discrete signal level using a suitable length number representation (e.g. 8 bits) to produce a discrete scan data signal. A suitable quantization level can be selected in view of expected noise levels in the signal. Thereafter, the discrete scan data signal is processed by the programmed processor (e.g., a digital signal processor <b>1707</b> and associated memory <b>1709</b> as shown) to generate a sequence of digital words (i.e. a sequence of digital count values) D<sub>3</sub>, each representing the time length associated with the signal level transitions in the corresponding digital scan data signal as described above. Preferably, these digital count values are in a suitable digital format for use in carrying out various symbol decoding operations which, like the scanning pattern and volume of the present invention, will be determined primarily by the particular scanning application at hand.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B through 17D</figref> illustrate exemplary digital implementations of the multi-path scan data processing according to the present invention. The digital signal processing operations therein are preferably carried out on the discrete scan data signal levels generated by the A/D converter <b>1705</b> and stored in the memory <b>1709</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> illustrates exemplary digital signal processing operations that identify a data frame (e.g., a portion of the discrete scan data signal levels stored in memory <b>1709</b>) that potentially represents a bar code symbol (block <b>1723</b>) and stores the data frame in a working buffer (block <b>1725</b>). Signal processing techniques that identify a data frame (within the discrete signal levels stored in the memory <b>1709</b>) that potentially represents a bar code symbol (block <b>1723</b>) are well know in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> illustrates exemplary digital signal processing operations that carry out multi-path scan data signal processing according to the present invention.

Sub-sampling (or decimation) decreases the effective sampling rate of the system. Sub-sampling is typically accomplished by averaging data values.
