<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a switching power source apparatus that is highly efficient, compact, and low noise.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a switching power source apparatus according to a related art (Non-Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 2). In the switching power source apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a DC power source Vdc<b>1</b> is connected through a primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>(the number of turns of n<b>1</b>) of a transformer T to a main switch Q<b>1</b> that is made of, for example, a MOSFET (hereinafter referred to as FET). Each end of the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>is connected to a parallel circuit composed of a resistor R<b>2</b> and a capacitor C<b>2</b> and a diode D<b>3</b> that is connected in series with the parallel circuit. The main switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on/off by PWM control of a control circuit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the transformer T are wound to generate in-phase voltages. The secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>(the number of turns of n<b>2</b>) is connected to a rectifying-smoothing circuit composed of diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, a reactor L<b>1</b>, and a capacitor C<b>4</b>. The rectifying-smoothing circuit rectifies and smoothes a voltage (ON/OFF-controlled pulse voltage) induced by the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the transformer T and outputs a DC voltage to a load RL.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The control circuit <b>100</b> has an operational amplifier and a photocoupler (not shown). The operational amplifier compares an output voltage of the load RL with a reference voltage, and if the output voltage of the load RL is equal to or larger than the reference voltage, narrows the ON width of a pulse to be applied to the main switch Q<b>1</b>. Namely, narrowing the ON width of a pulse to the main switch Q<b>1</b> when the output voltage of the load RL becomes equal to or larger than the reference voltage controls the output voltage to a constant voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Next, operation of the switching power source apparatus having the above-mentioned configuration will be explained with reference to a timing chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there are shown a terminal voltage Q<b>1</b><i>v </i>of the main switch Q<b>1</b>, a current Q<b>1</b><i>i </i>passing to the main switch Q<b>1</b>, and a Q<b>1</b>-control signal to conduct ON/OFF control of the main switch Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At time t<b>31</b>, the main switch Q<b>1</b> turns on in response to the Q<b>1</b>-control signal, and the DC power source Vdc<b>1</b> passes the current Q<b>1</b><i>i </i>through the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T to the main switch Q<b>1</b>. This current linearly increases as time passes up to time t<b>32</b>. Like the current Q<b>1</b><i>i</i>, a current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>passing through the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>linearly increases as time passes up to time t<b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Between time t<b>31</b> and time t<b>32</b>, the main switch Q<b>1</b> side of the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>is a negative (−) side and the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>are in-phase. Accordingly, the anode side of the diode D<b>1</b> becomes a positive (+) side to pass a current in order of <b>5</b><i>b</i>, D<b>1</b>, L<b>1</b>, C<b>4</b>, and <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Next, at time t<b>32</b>, the main switch Q<b>1</b> changes from ON state to OFF state according to the Q<b>1</b>-control signal. At this time, excitation energy of the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T and energy of a leakage inductance Lg (an inductance not coupled with the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b</i>) are not transferred to the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and therefore, are accumulated through the diode D<b>3</b> in the capacitor C<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Between time t<b>32</b> and time t<b>33</b>, the main switch Q<b>1</b> is OFF, and therefore, the current Q<b>1</b><i>i </i>and the current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>passing through the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>become zero. Between time t<b>32</b> and time t<b>33</b>, a current passes in order of L<b>1</b>, C<b>4</b>, D<b>2</b>, and L<b>1</b>, to supply power to the load RL.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to this switching power source apparatus, insertion of the snubber circuit (C<b>2</b>, R<b>2</b>) relaxes a temporal change of the voltage of the main switch Q<b>1</b> to reduce switching noise and suppresses a surge voltage applied from the leakage inductance Lg of the transformer T to the main switch Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Non-Patent Document 1: Kousuke Harada “Switching Power Source Handbook,” Nikkan Kogyo Shinbunsha Shuppan, Chapter 2 Basic Circuit and Designing Practice of Switching Power Source, p. 27, FIG. 2.2</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Non-Patent Document 2: Kazuo Shimizu “High-Speed Switching Regulator,” Sougou Denshi Shuppansha, 2.2.1 Separately Excited Converter, p. 30, FIG. 2.5</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the switching power source apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, charge being accumulated in the capacitor C<b>2</b> is consumed by the resistor R<b>2</b>, to increase a loss. This loss is proportional to a conversion frequency. If the conversion frequency is increased to reduce the size of the apparatus, the loss increases to deteriorate efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a transformer exciting current passed to the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T linearly increases at positive values when the main switch Q<b>1</b> is ON, and when the main switch Q<b>1</b> is OFF, linearly decreases to zero. Namely, magnetic flux of the transformer T only uses the first quadrant of a B-H curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Switching power source apparatuses according to embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A switching power source apparatus according to the first embodiment employs an auxiliary reactor so that a snubber capacitor connected through a diode to the auxiliary reactor is charged when a main switch is turned on. When the main switch is turned off, the snubber capacitor discharges to a clamp capacitor to make the inclination of a voltage increase gentler at the time when the main switch is turned off. At the same time, an auxiliary switch connected in series with the clamp capacitor is turned on, to bias the magnetic flux of a transformer toward a minus side to expand the range of change of magnetic flux. When an exciting current increases, the auxiliary switch is turned off to make the main switch conduct zero-voltage switching (ZVS). In this way, this embodiment establishes ZVS, improves efficiency, decreases noise, and reduces the size of the transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the switching power source apparatus according to the first embodiment. In the switching power source apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each end of a DC power source Vdc<b>1</b> is connected to a series circuit consisting of a primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>(the number of turns of n<b>1</b>) of a transformer T<b>1</b> and a switch Q<b>1</b> (main switch) made of a FET. Each end of the switch Q<b>1</b> is connected to a diode D<b>4</b> in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A node between a first end of the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T<b>1</b> and a first end of the switch Q<b>1</b> is connected to a first end of a switch Q<b>2</b> (auxiliary switch). A second end of the switch Q<b>2</b> is connected through a clamp capacitor C<b>1</b> to a positive electrode of the DC power source Vdc<b>1</b>. The second end of the switch Q<b>2</b> may be connected through the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b> to a negative electrode of the DC power source Vdc<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each end of the switch Q<b>2</b> is connected to a diode D<b>3</b> in parallel. The diode D<b>4</b> may be a parasitic diode of the switch Q<b>1</b>, and the diode D<b>3</b> may be a parasitic diode of the switch Q<b>2</b>. Each end of the switch Q<b>2</b> is connected to a series circuit consisting of a diode Dx<b>2</b> and a snubber capacitor Cx. Each end of the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T<b>1</b> is connected to a series circuit consisting of an auxiliary reactor Lx, a diode Dx<b>1</b>, and the snubber capacitor Cx.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A node between the capacitor Cx and the diode Dx<b>1</b> and a node between the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b> and the switch Q<b>2</b> are connected to the diode Dx<b>2</b>. By adjusting the capacitance of the capacitor Cx, the inclination of a voltage increase of the switch Q<b>1</b> is relaxed when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The switches Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> have a period (dead time) in which both of them are OFF. These switches are alternately turned on/off under PWM control of a control circuit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>(the number of turns of n<b>2</b>) that is in-phase with the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>are wound around a core of the transformer T<b>1</b>. A first end of the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>is connected to an anode of a diode D<b>1</b>. A cathode of the diode D<b>1</b> and a second end of the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>are connected to a diode D<b>2</b>. Each end of the diode D<b>2</b> is connected to a series circuit consisting of a reactor L<b>1</b> and a capacitor C<b>4</b>. The diode D<b>1</b>, diode D<b>2</b>, capacitor C<b>4</b>, and reactor L<b>1</b> form a rectifying-smoothing circuit. The capacitor C<b>4</b> provides a DC output to a load RL.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The control circuit <b>10</b> alternately turns on/off the switches Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. If an output voltage of the load RL exceeds a reference voltage, the control circuit <b>10</b> narrows the ON-width of a pulse applied to the switch Q<b>1</b> and widens the ON-width of a pulse applied to the switch Q<b>2</b>. Namely, if an output voltage of the load RL exceeds the reference voltage, the ON-width of a pulse to the switch Q<b>1</b> is narrowed to control the output voltage to a constant voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T<b>1</b> usually passes an AC current of equal magnitude. Accordingly, magnetic flux equally increases and decreases in the first and third quadrants around a zero point on a B-H curve. However, a circuit loss is involved so that magnetic flux shows incomplete symmetry and is mainly active in the first quadrant.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As a result, by increasing the magnetic permeability p of the core, the transformer T<b>1</b> of the first embodiment produces magnetic flux B (more precisely, B is flux density and magnetic flux is φ=B·S where S is the cross sectional area of the core, this embodiment assuming S=1 and φ=B) that saturates at Bm with respect to a given positive magnetic field H as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The magnetic flux also saturates at −Bm with respect to a given negative magnetic field H. A magnetic field H occurs in proportion to the magnitude of a current i. In the transformer T<b>1</b>, magnetic flux B moves along the B-H curve in order of Ba, Bb, Bc, Bd, Be, Bf, and Bg. The moving range of magnetic flux is wide. An interval between Ba and Bb and an interval between Bg and Bf each correspond to a saturated state.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a B-H curve with the magnetic permeability μ of the core being low. When the magnetic permeability μ of the core is low, the core does not saturate.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Operation of the switching power source apparatus according to the first embodiment with the above-mentioned configuration will be explained with reference to timing charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref> and <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a timing chart showing signals at several parts of the switching power source apparatus of the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a timing chart showing the details of the signals at the several parts of the switching power source apparatus of the first embodiment when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a timing chart showing the details of the signals at the several parts of the switching power source apparatus of the first embodiment when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, there are shown a terminal voltage Q<b>1</b><i>v </i>of the switch Q<b>1</b>, a current Q<b>1</b><i>i </i>passing to the switch Q<b>1</b>, a terminal voltage Q<b>2</b><i>v </i>of the switch Q<b>2</b>, a current Q<b>2</b><i>i </i>passing to the switch Q<b>2</b>, and a terminal voltage Cxv of the capacitor Cx.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At time t<b>1</b> (corresponding to time t<b>11</b> to t<b>12</b>), the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on and a current passes in order of Vdc<b>1</b>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, Q<b>1</b>, and Vdc<b>1</b>. At this time, the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the transformer T<b>1</b> generates a voltage to pass a current in order of <b>5</b><i>b</i>, D<b>1</b>, L<b>1</b>, C<b>4</b>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. When the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off, a current passes in order of L<b>1</b>, C<b>4</b>, D<b>2</b>, and L<b>1</b> to supply power to the load RL.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on, the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T<b>1</b> passes a current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>to accumulate energy in an exciting inductance of the transformer T<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>changes to take a current value a (negative value) at time t<b>1</b>, a current value b (negative value) at time t<b>1</b><i>b</i>, a current value c (zero) at time t<b>13</b>, and a current value d (positive value) at time t<b>2</b>. On the B-H curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, magnetic flux changes in order of Ba, Bb, Bc, and Bd. Ba to Bg of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> correspond to a to g of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At this time, a current is passed to the capacitor Cx in order of Vdc<b>1</b>, Lx, Dx<b>1</b>, Cx, Q<b>1</b>, and Vdc<b>1</b>. Due to a resonance between the auxiliary reactor Lx and the capacitor Cx, the capacitor Cx increases the voltage thereof up to the sum of a voltage Vdc<b>1</b> of the DC power source and a voltage of the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, at time t<b>2</b> (t<b>21</b> to t<b>24</b>), the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off. The energy accumulated in the exciting inductance of the transformer T<b>1</b> discharges the capacitor Cx in order of <b>5</b><i>a</i>, Cx, Dx<b>2</b>, C<b>1</b>, and <b>5</b><i>a</i>, to thereby charge the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b>. At this time, the voltage Q<b>1</b><i>v </i>of the switch Q<b>1</b> gently rises due to the action of the capacitor Cx. A rise of voltage of the switch Q<b>1</b> becomes gentler as the capacitance of the capacitor Cx becomes larger as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the voltage of the capacitor Cx decreases to zero, the switch Q<b>2</b> is turned on. Namely, the switch Q<b>2</b> becomes a zero-voltage switch. From time t<b>2</b> to t<b>20</b>, the current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>changes from the current value d (positive value) to a current value e (zero). On the B-H curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, magnetic flux changes from Bd to Be.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the completion of discharge of the energy of the exciting inductance of the transformer T<b>1</b>, the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b> discharges from time t<b>20</b> to t<b>3</b> in order of C<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and C<b>1</b> to reset the magnetic flux of the transformer T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">From time t<b>20</b> to t<b>3</b>, the energy accumulated in the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b> is fed back to the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T, and therefore, the current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>becomes a negative value as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. From time t<b>20</b> to t<b>2</b><i>a</i>, the current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>changes from the current value e (zero) to a current value f (negative value). On the B-H curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, magnetic flux changes from Be to Bf. An area S between time t<b>2</b> and t<b>20</b> is equal to an area S between time t<b>20</b> to t<b>2</b><i>a</i>. The area S corresponds to the energy of the transformer T<b>1</b> accumulated in the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, from time t<b>2</b><i>a </i>to t<b>3</b>, the current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>changes from the current value f (negative value) to a current value g (negative value). On the B-H curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, magnetic flux changes from Bf to Bg. An area E between time t<b>2</b><i>a </i>and t<b>3</b> corresponds to the energy of the capacitor Cx accumulated in the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Namely, the energy accumulated in the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b> is the sum of the energy of the transformer T<b>1</b> and the energy of the capacitor Cx. The current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>is increased by the energy supplied from the capacitor Cx at the time of resetting. Accordingly, magnetic flux moves to the third quadrant to reach the saturation region (Bf-Bg), and the current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>increases to the maximum at time t<b>3</b> (also at time t<b>1</b>). The current n<b>1</b><i>i </i>increases just before the end of the ON-period of the switch Q<b>2</b>. At this time, the transformer T<b>1</b> saturates.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At time t<b>3</b>, the current Q<b>2</b><i>i </i>of the switch Q<b>2</b> also reaches a maximum. At this time, the switch Q<b>2</b> is turned off, and the voltage Q<b>1</b><i>v </i>of the switch Q<b>1</b> rapidly decreases to zero. Then, the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on to realize ZVS of the switch Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The current of the switch Q<b>2</b> just before turning off the switch Q<b>2</b> to realize ZVS of the switch Q<b>1</b> is dependent on the capacitance of the capacitor connected in parallel with the switch Q<b>1</b>. As the capacitance becomes smaller, the current becomes smaller. Accordingly, the capacitance may be set to be small. If the capacitance is small, however, the inclination of a voltage produced when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off increases, to increase the loss and noise of the switch. To avoid this, it is preferable that the parallel capacitance is small when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on and is large when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off. To realize this, according to the first embodiment, the capacitance is decreased when turning on the switch Q<b>1</b> (parasitic capacitance between the drain and source of the switch Q<b>1</b> will do) and the capacitor Cx is added in parallel through the diode Dx<b>2</b> when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the capacitance of the capacitor Cx is sufficiently increased as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the inclination (dv/dt) of a voltage increase of the switch Q<b>1</b> is relaxed when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off. This results in reducing the noise and loss of the switch Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Increasing the magnetic permeability μ of the core and enlarging the capacitance of the capacity Cx move the energy of the capacitor Cx to the clamp capacitor C<b>1</b> and shift the magnetic flux of the transformer T<b>1</b> to the third quadrant. This results in expanding the range of use of the transformer T<b>1</b>, increasing a current, and easily realizing ZVS of the switch Q<b>1</b>. The current becomes larger than that obtained in the saturation region of the core of the transformer T<b>1</b>, to easily realize the ZVS operation of the switch Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A switching power source apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the switching power source apparatus according to the second embodiment. The switching power source apparatus of the second embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> differs from the switching power source apparatus of the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in a circuit on the secondary side of a transformer T<b>2</b>, and therefore, only this part will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The transformer T<b>2</b> has a primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>(the number of turns of n<b>1</b>), a secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>(the number of turns of n<b>2</b>), and a tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>(the number of turns of n<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Each end of a series circuit consisting of the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>and tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the transformer T<b>2</b> is connected to a series circuit consisting of a diode D<b>6</b> and a capacitor C<b>4</b>. A node between the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>and the tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>and a node between the diode D<b>6</b> and the capacitor C<b>4</b> are connected to a diode D<b>5</b>. The primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>are wound in the same phase, and the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>are wound in opposite phases.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>and primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T<b>2</b> are loosely coupled, and a leakage inductance between the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>is used as a reactor (not shown) connected in series with the transformer T<b>2</b>. The tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>and primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T<b>2</b> are slightly loosely coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Operation of the switching power source apparatus of the second embodiment with the above-mentioned configuration will be explained. A basic operation of the second embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment, and therefore, operation of the circuit on the secondary side of the transformer T<b>2</b> will be mainly explained.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on, a current passes in order of Vdc<b>1</b>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, Q<b>1</b>, and Vdc<b>1</b>. At this time, the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the transformer T<b>2</b> generates a voltage to pass a current in order of <b>5</b><i>b</i>, D<b>5</b>, C<b>4</b>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. As a result, a current to the diode D<b>5</b> linearly increases.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off, and energy accumulated in the leakage inductance between the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the transformer T<b>2</b> is returned through the transformer T<b>2</b> to the secondary side. On the secondary side, a voltage is induced on the tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the transformer T<b>2</b>, to pass a current in order of <b>5</b><i>c</i>, D<b>6</b>, C<b>4</b>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and <b>5</b><i>c</i>. Namely, the diode D<b>6</b> passes the current.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this way, the value of the inductance connected in series with the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the transformer T<b>2</b> is increased to return energy accumulated when the switch Q<b>1</b> is ON to the secondary side through the transformer T<b>2</b>, to thereby increase efficiency. Due to the diodes D<b>5</b> and D<b>6</b>, a secondary current continuously passes during the ON and OFF periods of the switch Q<b>1</b>, to reduce a ripple current of the capacitor C<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a view showing the structure of the transformer installed in the switching power source apparatus of the second embodiment. The transformer T<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has a core <b>30</b> having an H-shape with closed top and bottom. A core part <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the core <b>30</b> is wound with the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>those are close to each other to form a slight leakage inductance between them. The core <b>30</b> has a path core <b>30</b><i>c </i>and a gap <b>31</b>. A peripheral core is wound with the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Namely, the path core <b>30</b><i>c </i>loosely couples the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>with the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b</i>, to increase the leakage inductance.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The core <b>30</b> of the transformer T<b>2</b> is wound with the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>so as to form the leakage inductance, and the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and tertiary winding <b>5</b><i>c </i>are wound to form a leakage inductance that is smaller than that formed by the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">On the peripheral core between the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b</i>, there are formed two recesses <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The recesses <b>30</b><i>b </i>partly narrow the cross sectional area of a magnetic path of the peripheral core, so that only the narrowed parts saturate to reduce a core loss.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">By devising the shape and windings of the core of the transformer T<b>2</b> in such a way, this embodiment reduces the switching power source apparatus in size and cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">THIRD EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A switching power source apparatus according to the third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the switching power source apparatus according to the third embodiment. The switching power source apparatus of the third embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> differs from the switching power source apparatus of the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in a circuit on the secondary side of a transformer T<b>3</b>, and therefore, only this part will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A core of the transformer T<b>3</b> is wound with a primary winding <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>(the number of turns of n<b>2</b>) that is of an opposite phase relative to the phase of the primary winding <b>5</b><i>a</i>. A first end of the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>is connected to an anode of a diode D<b>1</b>. A cathode of the diode D<b>1</b> and a second end of the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>are connected to a capacitor C<b>4</b>. The diode D<b>1</b> and capacitor C<b>4</b> form a rectifying-smoothing circuit. The capacitor C<b>4</b> smoothes a rectified voltage of the diode D<b>1</b> and provides a DC output to a load RL.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Operation of the switching power source apparatus of the third embodiment with the above-mentioned configuration will be explained with reference to timing charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 to 18</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a timing chart showing signals at several parts of the switching power source apparatus of the third embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a timing chart showing the details of the signals at the several parts of the switching power source apparatus of the third embodiment when a switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a timing chart showing the details of the signals at the several parts of the switching power source apparatus of the third embodiment when the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 to 18</figref>, there are shown a terminal voltage Q<b>1</b><i>v </i>of the switch Q<b>1</b>, a current Q<b>1</b><i>i </i>passing to the switch Q<b>1</b>, a terminal voltage Q<b>2</b><i>v </i>of a switch Q<b>2</b>, a current Q<b>2</b><i>i </i>passing to the switch Q<b>2</b>, a current Cxi passing to a capacitor Cx, a terminal voltage Cxv of the capacitor Cx, and a current D<b>1</b><i>i </i>passing to the diode D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The timing charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 to 18</figref> are substantially the same as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>. Only difference between them is operation of the circuit on the secondary side of the transformer T<b>3</b>, and therefore, operation of only the secondary side will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At time t<b>1</b> (corresponding to time t<b>11</b> to t<b>12</b>), the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned on to pass a current in order of Vdc<b>1</b>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, Q<b>1</b>, and Vdc<b>1</b>. At this time, no current passes to the diode D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At time t<b>2</b> (t<b>21</b> to t<b>24</b>), the switch Q<b>1</b> is turned off, so that the capacitor Cx relaxes the inclination of a voltage increase in the OFF state of the switch Q<b>1</b>. Energy accumulated in the capacitor Cx is stored through a diode Dx<b>2</b> in a clamp capacitor C<b>1</b>. This energy is supplied to the secondary winding <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the transformer T<b>3</b> when the switch Q<b>2</b> is turned on to pass the current D<b>1</b><i>i </i>to the diode D<b>1</b> and supply power to a load RL.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this way, the switching power source apparatus of the third embodiment provides an effect similar to that provided by the switching power source apparatus of the first embodiment.</p>
