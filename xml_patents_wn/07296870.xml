<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to managing consumable wear in printers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many currently available color laser printers have two modes: a color mode and a monochrome mode. In the color mode, a color cartridge is engaged and is therefore available for use along with a monochrome cartridge. In the monochrome mode color components are disengaged to save wear. Several seconds are typically required to complete a switch between color and monochrome modes. During this switch, some additional wear and tear on the color cartridge and other components may result.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Where the usage rate of the color cartridge is sufficiently high, consumables within the cartridge are depleted within the life cycle of the cartridge. Alternatively, where the percentage of monochrome pages printed is high enough, and the usage rate of the color cartridge is below a threshold level, wear and tear on mechanically active components within the cartridge, as well as wear and tear on consumables such as toner within the cartridge, will degrade the print quality of the cartridge before exhaustion of the supply of consumables within the cartridge. In other words, where pages printed entirely in monochrome exceed a threshold value, and color use is minimal, an engaged color cartridge will wear out before it is depleted. Accordingly, the user will not receive the rated page output for the cartridge.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment of the invention, a printer or other color output device is configured to manage consumable wear. A wear level and a consumable use level of a color cartridge are evaluated. A color cartridge failure mechanism is projected to be either color cartridge wear-out or consumable exhaustion.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram representing an exemplary printer <b>100</b>, such as a color copier, multifunctional peripheral or other color output device, configured to switch between color and monochrome modes to reduce color cartridge wear-out prior to color cartridge consumables exhaustion. In an exemplary application, a color cartridge is engaged during color mode, and disengaged during monochrome mode. In the application, color cartridge wear-out and color cartridge consumables exhaustion are failure mechanisms by which color cartridge failure is experienced. The exemplary printer <b>100</b> is configured with a processor <b>102</b>, memory <b>104</b> and firmware <b>106</b>. A print mechanism <b>108</b> is adapted for operation with a color cartridge <b>110</b> and a black or monochrome cartridge <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The firmware <b>106</b> includes a printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b>, which is configured to examine risk factors to a color cartridge <b>110</b> and to switch between color and monochrome modes <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> to reduce color cartridge wear-out prior to color cartridge consumable exhaustion when color cartridge wear-out is predicted. Thus, in some circumstances, the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b> may determine that the color cartridge <b>110</b> will wear out prior to using all consumables, e.g. color toner. In such conditions, the module <b>114</b> may switch between software to control a color mode <b>116</b> and a monochrome mode <b>118</b> to reduce wear to the color cartridge <b>110</b>, and thereby extend the life span of the color cartridge until the point of consumables exhaustion (e.g. until the toner is exhausted).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a first exemplary version <b>200</b> of the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b>. In the version seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a risk factor evaluation module <b>202</b> is configured to evaluate the risk to the color cartridge <b>110</b> that wear-out will occur prior to consumables exhaustion. Where risk factors indicate the benefit of doing so, a switching module <b>204</b> is configured to switch between color and monochrome modes <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. As seen above, when color mode <b>116</b> is engaged, the printer is able to print in color, and moving parts within the color cartridge <b>110</b> are engaged, thereby increasing a wear rate on both the mechanical parts of the cartridge, as well as a wear rate on the consumables, such as toner, contained within the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a recent page risk factor evaluation module <b>206</b> is configured to establish a printing history based on an arbitrary quantity of recent pages printed, such as, for example, the most recent 2000 pages printed. The printing history may include a number of elements, including but not limited to the following factors: a percentage of color pages within the total number of pages printed; a percentage of toner coverage for each color; number of pages per print job; number of pages by paper size; and, number of pages per job by paper size.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A current cartridge evaluation module <b>208</b> records information similar to that recorded by the recent page evaluation module <b>206</b>, but which is based on the number of pages which were printed by the current color cartridge. Therefore, the current cartridge evaluation module <b>208</b> includes information related to the degree to which the color cartridge <b>110</b> is worn out, and also the degree to which the consumables are exhausted.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A paper type and use evaluation module <b>210</b> is configured to record the types and sizes of paper used in an arbitrary number of pages printed, such as the most recent 2000 pages printed. Because different paper types and paper sizes may be statistically correlated with color output or monochrome output, the paper type and use evaluation module <b>210</b> can additionally be configured to notify the switching module <b>204</b> to switch modes based on information contained within a print job indicating use of a particular paper type or size.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a second exemplary version <b>300</b> of the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b>. In the version seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the risk factor evaluation module <b>202</b> additionally includes a risk level classification module <b>302</b>. Information on the risk factors facing the color cartridge <b>110</b> are evaluated by the risk factor evaluation module <b>202</b>, allowing the risk level classification module <b>302</b> to classify data related to the color cartridge <b>110</b> as being either consistent with a color cartridge wear-out criteria <b>304</b> or consistent with a color cartridge consumables exhaustion criteria <b>306</b>. Note that it is desirable for data associated with the color cartridge to be consistent with the color cartridge consumables exhaustion criteria <b>306</b>, since this means that the user will have obtained all of the benefit of the consumables, such as toner. The color cartridge wear-out criteria <b>304</b> and the color cartridge consumables exhaustion criteria <b>306</b> include information such as the number of sheets printed, the number of sheets printed in color and the percentage of toner coverage for each color which is consistent with each criteria. The information contained within the color cartridge wear-out criteria <b>304</b> module and color cartridge consumables exhaustion criteria <b>306</b> module are specific to each color cartridge <b>110</b>. Additionally, the printer mode switching module <b>114</b> may be adapted for use in a number of different printers. Accordingly, each module <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> may contain information related to a plurality of color cartridges, or may be configured to be updated to include the color cartridge currently in use.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The switching module <b>204</b> of the second exemplary version <b>300</b> includes a user interface <b>308</b>, which may be used to announce to the user that mode switching is taking place, and which may additionally present the user with an opportunity to override the mode switching. In particular, a mode switching notice presentation module <b>310</b> informs the user that mode switching is taking place, and may include information to inform the user of the benefits and drawbacks of mode switching. For example, the user interface <b>308</b> may present the user with the choice of either minimizing the chance of color cartridge wear-out or obtaining faster printing performance. The mode switching notice presentation module <b>310</b> may operate on a workstation operated by the user, using such interface tools as dialog boxes, or on a control panel mounted on the printer or color copier. Alternatively, a mode switching recommendations and optional overrides presentation module <b>312</b> may present the user with a dialog box on a workstation or an indicator on a printer control panel containing recommendations as to whether mode switching should be performed, and allow the user to decide.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The switching module <b>204</b> may additionally contain frequent, moderate and infrequent mode switching control modules <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, which perform mode switching at different rates and under different circumstances. For example, where the use history of the color cartridge <b>110</b> indicates that the cartridge is within the color cartridge wear-out criteria <b>304</b>, the frequent switching control module <b>314</b> is used. When the use history of the color cartridge <b>110</b> indicates that the cartridge is within the color cartridge consumables exhaustion criteria <b>306</b> the infrequent mode switching control module <b>318</b> is used. When the use history of the color cartridge <b>110</b> does not clearly indicate whether consumables will be exhausted prior to wear-out, the moderate mode switching control module <b>316</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary implementation of a method <b>400</b> to resolve mode switching decisions based on risk level and user input. The elements of the method may be performed by any desired means, such as by the execution of processor-readable instructions defined on a processor-readable media, such as a disk, a ROM or other memory device or by operation of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other hardware device. In one embodiment, the ROM may contain firmware implementing the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> according to an exemplary method as seen in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In an alternative embodiment, an ASIC may contain logic implementing the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b> according to an exemplary method as seen in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The actions described in the blocks of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be performed in parallel with actions described in other blocks, may occur in an alternate order, or may be distributed in a manner which associates actions with more than one other block.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At block <b>402</b>, risk factors to a color cartridge <b>110</b> are evaluated by looking at usage patterns and consumables remaining. The risk factors involve use patterns that could result in the color cartridge <b>110</b> having a failure mechanism involving wear-out, rather than consumables exhaustion. Where the color cartridge <b>110</b> wears out prior to exhausting all consumables, the user fails to receive the full benefit of the color cartridge <b>110</b>. In one implementation, the risk factor evaluation module <b>202</b> evaluates the risks to the color cartridge <b>110</b> of wear-out before consumable exhaustion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At block <b>404</b>, a risk level to the color cartridge is determined, in view of the risk factors evaluated. In one implementation, the risk level classification module <b>302</b> classifies the risk to the color cartridge <b>110</b> of wear-out before consumable exhaustion. The classification may be made by comparing the use history of the color cartridge <b>110</b> to the color cartridge wear-out criteria <b>304</b> and to the color cartridge consumables exhaustion criteria <b>306</b>. For any given color cartridge <b>110</b>, the criteria <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> may be consulted to facilitate determination of the risk to the color cartridge <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At block <b>406</b>, a user interface may optionally be presented to the user to indicate that mode switching is taking place. The user interface may be managed by a user interface module <b>308</b> or similar structure. The notice to the user may be made by the use of a dialog box or other means suggested by the operating system involved.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Where the user interface module <b>308</b> is configured to give the user greater influence over the mode switching process, the user interface may convey recommendations on whether to switch modes. The user may then elect to allow the mode switching or prevent it.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At block <b>408</b>, the mode switching decisions are resolved based on the determination of the risk level and/or any available user input. In one implementation, the mode switching module <b>204</b> resolves mode switching decisions using software, firmware or hardware-based logic. For example, where the risk level to the color cartridge <b>110</b> was determined to be consistent with the color cartridge wear-out criteria <b>304</b>, the mode may be switched from color to monochrome if the print job is monochrome to prevent additional wear on the color cartridge <b>110</b>. Alternately, where the risk level to the color cartridge <b>110</b> was determined to be low, because the expected fate of the color cartridge <b>110</b> was predicted to be consistent with the consumables exhaustion criteria <b>306</b>, the color cartridge <b>110</b> may be left to operate in color mode, even when the print job is monochrome, since this saves the user from waiting for the mode change. Additionally, where exhaustion of the consumables (e.g. toner) is predicted to precede wear-out, there is little benefit from sparing the color cartridge <b>110</b> the additional wear it would experience in printing a monochrome print job while in color mode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a further exemplary implementation, wherein a method <b>500</b> is employed to resolve mode switching decisions based on risk level. The elements of the method may be performed by any desired means, such as by the execution of processor-readable instructions defined on a processor-readable media, such as a disk, a ROM or other memory device or by operation of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other hardware device. In one embodiment, the ROM may contain firmware implementing the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> according to an exemplary method as seen in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In an alternative embodiment, an ASIC may contain logic which implements the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b> according to an exemplary method as seen in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Also, actions described in any block may be performed in parallel with actions described in other blocks, may occur in an alternate order, or may be distributed in a manner which associates actions with more than one other block.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At block <b>502</b>, a current wear level of the color cartridge <b>110</b> is evaluated. For example, the current cartridge evaluation module <b>208</b> may be used to determine the current wear level, which is typically estimated by a count of pages printed in color mode and monochrome pages printed while the printer was in color mode.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At block <b>504</b>, a consumable use level of the color cartridge is also measured. The consumable use level is typically estimated by a count of pages printed in color mode, modified by average toner coverage levels for each color. For example, this functionality may be performed by the current cartridge evaluation module <b>208</b> or similar structure implemented in software, firmware or hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At block <b>506</b>, a color cartridge failure mechanism is projected to be either color cartridge wear-out or consumable exhaustion. This projection may be made by the risk level classification module <b>302</b> or similar structure implemented in software, firmware or hardware. At block <b>508</b>, in projecting the color cartridge failure mechanism, an estimated future wear rate and an estimated consumable consumption rate are based on past performance. The past performance may be monitored by a structure such as by the recent page evaluation module <b>206</b> or the current cartridge evaluation module <b>208</b> or similar structure implemented in software, firmware or hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At block <b>510</b>, mode switching decisions are resolved to prevent color cartridge wear-out using the projected color cartridge failure mechanism, unless such decisions are specifically overridden by the user's input. Switching decisions may be made by a switching module <b>204</b>, or similar structure implemented in software, firmware or hardware. For example, where color cartridge wear-out is projected, the user could be allowed to select between the advantages of either faster printing performance or reducing the risk of color cartridge wear-out. Thus, the user could elect to prevent mode switching to result in faster printing performance; alternatively, the user could elected to allow mode switching where that would result in reduced chance of color cartridge wear-out. Alternatively, where desired, the mode switching decision could be made in an automated manner consistent with a desired goal. In particular, at block <b>512</b> modes are switched more frequently, such as by a frequent mode switching module <b>314</b>, when color cartridge wear-out is predicted. This results in more monochrome print jobs being printed in monochrome mode, which protects the color cartridge <b>110</b> from wear during these print jobs. Additionally, at block <b>514</b>, modes are switched less frequently, or not at all, when consumable exhaustion is predicted, such as by an infrequent mode switching module <b>318</b>. This results in more monochrome print jobs being printed in color mode, since the wear on the color cartridge <b>110</b> is not expected to prevent full usage of the consumables.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a further exemplary implementation, wherein a method <b>600</b> is employed to resolve mode switching decisions. The elements of the method may be performed by any desired means, such as by the execution of processor-readable instructions defined on a processor-readable media, such as a disk, a ROM or other memory device or by operation of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other hardware device. In one embodiment, the ROM may contain firmware implementing the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, portions of which are implemented according to an exemplary method as seen in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In an alternative embodiment, an ASIC may contain logic which supports the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b>, portions of which are implemented according to an exemplary method as seen in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Also, actions described in any block may be performed in parallel with actions described in other blocks, may occur in an alternate order, or may be distributed in a manner which associates actions with more than one other block.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At block <b>602</b>, color use in previous pages is evaluated. In one example, the previous 2000 pages are examined for number of pages with color use and average toner coverage rates for each color by the recent page evaluation module <b>206</b> or similar structure implemented in software, firmware or hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At block <b>604</b>, a wear rate verses a use rate is evaluated for a specific color cartridge <b>110</b> installed in the printer <b>100</b> by the current cartridge evaluation module <b>208</b> or similar structure implemented in software, firmware or hardware. Thus, only a number of past pages equal to the number of pages printed by the current color cartridge <b>110</b> are evaluated. Accordingly, the current status of the color cartridge <b>110</b> is known.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>606</b>, paper type and usage rates are examined, typically for the previous 2000 (or other desired quantity) pages. Such an examination may be made by the paper type and use evaluation module <b>210</b> or similar structure implemented in software, firmware or hardware. Because certain types of paper are strongly associated with either color or monochrome print jobs, monitoring the usage rates of different types of paper can be an indicator of the activity of the color cartridge <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At block <b>608</b>, in some applications, the recent page evaluation module <b>206</b> or similar module may additionally evaluate the number of immediately preceding monochrome pages. Where a number of monochrome pages have been printed, the likelihood that the next page to be printed will be monochrome is increased, and this factor may be evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At block <b>610</b>, pages yet to be printed are evaluated, to the extent possible, to determine if they are color or monochrome. In some cases, several pages are buffered within a printer. In this case, a look-ahead algorithm may be implemented within the risk factor evaluation module <b>202</b> or other convenient location and used to examine the buffered pages for determination if the content is color or monochrome. Alternatively, in some applications the header accompanying a print job will identify the print job as either containing or not containing color content.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At block <b>612</b>, mode switching decisions may be made by the printer mode switching decision module <b>114</b> using the evaluations of blocks <b>602</b> through <b>610</b>. The weight given to any evaluation may be varied according to the application. Mode switching will be performed in a manner consistent with reducing wear-out of the color cartridge <b>110</b>, except as directed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a further exemplary implementation, wherein a method <b>700</b> is employed to resolve mode switching decisions.

Also, actions described in any block may be performed in parallel with actions described in other blocks, may occur in an alternate order, or may be distributed in a manner which associates actions with more than one other block. Blocks <b>702</b>-<b>712</b> represent actions which may be supported by the risk factor evaluation module <b>202</b>, while the switching decisions of block <b>714</b> may be performed by the switching module <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At block <b>702</b>, the percentage of color vs. monochrome pages printed over an historical period, such as the previous 2000 pages, is evaluated.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>704</b>, the percentage of toner coverage for each color is evaluated. In this manner, the percentage of color pages previously found can be weighted, to determine their significance.</p>
