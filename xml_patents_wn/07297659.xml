<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Farming is the oldest wealth-creating business known to man. Current scientific strategies to maintain and improve yields in support of high-input agriculture place great emphasis on ‘fail-safe’ techniques for each component of the production sequence with little consideration of the integration of these components in a holistic, systems approach. Research for sustainable agricultural practices requires a far greater emphasis on such an approach than now is fashionable, despite all the rhetoric given politically to sustainability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The populations of the world's poorest countries have been growing rapidly, increasing the demand for food. At the same time environmental degradation—both natural and man made—has reduced the ability of farmers to grow food in many areas. A lot has been written about the significant contribution due to “Green Revolution” and correctly so, especially considering our failure to control unsustainable population growth. Thanks due to the high yielding varieties we are still self-sufficient in rice and wheat, but for how long? Hardly any one argues that modern agriculture is sustainable. Besides, high input agriculture is increasingly recognized as an environment degrading and not profitable. We now recognize that technical progress may have social and environmental costs we cannot pay. People are now seriously concerned with the protection of the environment and even more about safeguarding their health. As now people realize that by consuming the standard agriculture based food products they are constantly taking in small quantities of poison of various kinds and much of this comes from the chemical pesticides that are used to produce food crops.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modern farming requires large inputs of chemical fertilizer and stimulants to increase yields from hybrids. However for poor rural marginal farmers the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides have made agriculture very expensive and to maintain yields in deteriorating soils increasing doses of modern chemical inputs have had to be used. The time has now come to consider alternative means of sustaining our agriculture and to protect the farmer from low prices, high indebtedness and to ensure that production incentives remain. For small farmers, organic farming is most suitable as considerable vertical integration is possible and appreciable cost savings could be achieved through the recycling of waste and other materials that are available within the system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A considerable amount of literature is available on the practice of organic farming. Where organic farming is practiced, the farmer will use natural processes to enhance productivity, maintain the nutritive status of the soil to be less dependent on external resources and to keep his costs down. This will strengthen his social and financial position in the society. Organic farming uses natural materials which are the by products of the farm and are environmentally safe, it enhances the nutritive qualities of the soil and it nurtures the organisms in the soils, which are generally destroyed by the use of chemical manures and pesticides, and significantly reduces cost. Therefore at this juncture further work on the development of agriculture biotechnology products based on cow offers immense potential as viable alternative for sustainable agriculture. We have observed serendipitously that when cow urine is applied to seedlings of plants, it enhances overall growth of the plant and protects plants from plant pathogenic fungi. Experiments were undertaken to investigate the significance of these observations. According to Hindu mythology as well as the Indian traditional agricultural practices Vrikshayurveda of Surapala, an ancient Sanskrit text on the science of plant life describes the use of milk in changing the flower color and enhancing fruit taste [N. Sadhale (1996) Surapala's Vrikshayurveda (translated by N. Sadhale) Secunderabad, India: Asian Agri-History Foundation]. Panchgavya, a mixture of five cow products namely, dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee (clarified butter) is used in human medicine, to improve soil health and to protect plants from diseases [S. N. Singh (1971) Krishi-Parashar (translated by S. N. Singh). Varanasi, India: Jai Bharat Press]. Systematic collection and use of urine for fertilization purposes only dates back approximately one century. More than 90% of the total N content in urine is NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>−N. Also the K is predominantly present in inorganic form. This means that urine is comparable to commercial inorganic N and K fertilizer. The average K content in cattle urine is 0.7%, and when urine is applied to old grass sods strong effects are often seen—effects that have often been confused with an N effect—although it is primarily a K response.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Plants have remained central to every civilization as the primary source of life, due to their numerous applications in daily life. Plants are composed of chemical substances of which some are not directly beneficial for the growth and development of the organism. These secondary compounds have usually been regarded as a part of the plants' defense against plant-feeding insects and other herbivores [G. A. Rosenthal and D. H. Janzen (eds.) 1979 Herbivores: their interaction with secondary plant metabolites. Academic Press, New York]. The pesticidal properties of many plants have been known for a long time and natural pesticides based on plant extracts such as rotenone, nicotine and pyrethrum have been commonly used in pest control. Jacobson has reviewed literature on pesticides from more than 3000 plant species [M. Jacobson and D. G. Crosby (eds.) 1971. Naturally occurring insecticides. Dekker Inc. New York].</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Neem (Azadirachta indica) is so far the most promising example of plants currently used for pest control. Neem has remained for numerous purposes in Indian society and is known since ancient times in Sanskrit as “Arishta” meaning health bestower. A summary of how neem products are used as bio-pesticides, the mode of action, effect on pests and natural enemies has been prepared by Schmutterer [H. Schmutterer (1990) Annual Review of Entomology 35: 271-297]. Many agrochemical, therapeutic, and medicinal uses of neem are known [U. P. Singh and D. P. Singh (2002) Journal of Herbal Pharamcotherapy, 2: 13-28]. Disease caused by various microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses not only damage the plant as a whole but also severely affect quality of the crop. A number of physiological and biochemical alterations in the plants have been reported due to infection of the fungi, bacteria, and viruses [H. Schmutterer. Neem products for integrated pest management.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In The Neem Tree: Source of unique natural products for integrated pest management, medicine and other purposes (Schmutterer, H., Ed.). VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany. 1997; pp. 367-477]. Furthermore, control measures adopted to combat plant diseases have serious public concern because of the indiscriminate use of the synthetic pesticides. This has resulted in the intensive search to find the alternative methods for disease control and use of plant products in controlling plant pathogens could be a viable alternative [U. P. Singh and B. Prithiviraj (1997) Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology 51: 181-194]. Aqueous extracts of various parts of neem, e.g., leaf, bark, seed, pulp and inflorescence have been used successfully in vitro to inhibit the growth of various plant pathogenic fungi [U. P. Singh, R. B. Singh, and H. B. Singh (1980) Mycologia 72: 1077-1093; U. P. Singh and H. B. Singh (1981) Australian Journal of Plant Pathology 10: 66-67].</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Like neem, the antibacterial and antifungal properties of garlic (<i>Allium sativum </i>L) against human and plant pathogens are also well known [U. P. Singh, B. Prithviraj, B. K. Sarma, M. Singh and A. B. Ray (2001) Indian Journal of Experimental Biology 39: 310-322]. Oil of garlic in natural and synthetic forms has been reported to suppress the activity of many air and soil-borne fungi [N. B. K. Murthy and S. V. Amonkar (1973) Indian Journal of Experimental Biology 12: 208-209]. Several other workers have observed the antimicrobial activity of extracts of garlic [M. R. Tansey and J. A. Appleton (1975) Mycologia 67: 409-413; H. B. Singh and U. P. Singh (1981) Australian Journal of Plant Pathology 10: 66-67]. Singh et al. [U. P. Singh, K. K. Pathak, M. N. Khare and R. B. Singh (1979) Mycologia 71: 556-564] have shown that even garlic-leaf extract significantly reduced the growth of <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum </i>and <i>Fusarium oxysporum </i>f. sp. <i>ciceri</i>. Padwick causing wilts in gram (<i>Cicer arietinum </i>L.). Inhibition of growth and sclerotium formation in <i>Rhizoctonia solani </i>by garlic oil has also been reported [H. B. Singh and U. P. Singh (1980) Mycologia 72: 1022-1025].</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Improving soil fertility is one of the most common tactics to increase agricultural and forest production. Soil organisms, especially bacteria have a key role in determining the rate of organic matter decomposition and thereby nutrient mineralization. These processes determine the rate of nutrient supply to primary producers, largely determining the rate of biomass production and other fundamental ecosystem processes like interactions among different functional groups of organisms that constitute ecosystems [J. D. Bever, K. M. Westover and J. Antonovics (1997) Journal of Ecology 85: 561-573]. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms that determine species composition in plant communities is important. Rhizobacteria, once considered passive bystanders of the root environment, are now known to affect plant health, development, and environmental adaptation, both beneficially and detrimentally, and the importance of these bacteria in agriculture is expected to grow [D. J. O'Sullivan and F. O'Gara (1992) Microbiology Review 56: 662-676; R. J. Cook (2000) Annual Review of Phytopathology 38: 95-116]. A variety of mechanisms have been identified as being responsible for such plant growth promoting activity. For example, certain microorganisms indirectly promote plant growth by inhibiting the growth of deleterious microorganisms; or directly enhance plant growth by producing growth hormones; and/or by assisting in the uptake of nutrients by the crops, e.g., phosphorus (P) [C. S. Nautiyal et al., FEMS Microbiology Letters, Volume 182, pp. 291-296 (2000)].</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Plant disease suppression mechanisms involved includes antibiotic and siderophore-mediated suppression, and successful root colonization. A clear relationship has been established between the suppression of soil-borne diseases by bacteria and their densities in the rhizosphere [C. T. Bull, D. M. Weller and L. S. Thomashow (1991) Phytopathology 81: 954-959; B. J. Lugtenberg, L. Dekkers, L. and G. V. Bloemberg (2001) Annual Review of Phytopathology 39: 461-490]. We have observed that the effectiveness of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains in controlling soil-borne plant pathogens is generally related to their efficiency of root colonization [C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 33: 1-6; C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 35: 52-58; C. S. Nautiyal (1997) FEMS Microbiology Ecology 23: 145-158; C. S. Nautiyal (2002) U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,362].</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The ecology of rhizosphere competent bacteria is not yet well enough understood to predict the behavior and efficacy of PGPRs in phytosphere (leaf, stem, rhizosphere, and endorhizosphere) colonization and of the existence of crop specificity [C. S. Nautiyal (2000) In Biocontrol potential and its exploitation in sustainable agriculture. Edited by R. K. Upadhyay, K. G. Mukerji, and B. P. Chamola. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York. pp. 9-23]. Therefore, these findings suggest that rhizosphere microbial population is an important indicator of plant and soil health [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)].</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Microbial population studies can provide valuable information concerning the impact of introduced seed or soil treatment on indigenous microbial populations. Ideally, microbial population studies should be linked to broader aspects of ecosystem functioning, such as effects on plant growth, plant health, and nutrient cycling [M. N. Schroth and J. G. Hancock (1981) Annual Review of Phytopathology 35: 453-476; C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)]. Phenols have known to occur in all plants investigated so far. Some of them occur constitutively while others are formed in response to pathogen ingress and associated as part of an active defense response in the host [R. L. Nicholson and R. Hammerschmidt (1992) Annual Review of Phytopathology 30: 369-389]. There are also reports on a sudden increase in phenolic concentrations following inoculation with non-pathogenic organisms to the plants.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Direct reduction in fungal growth due to changes in phenolics in the tomato in response to inoculation with <i>Verticillium albo</i>-<i>atrum </i>is available in literature [M. A. Bernards and B. E. Ellis (1989) Journal of Plant Physiology 135: 21-26]. Seed bacterization with rhizobacteria results in greater accumulation of phenolic compounds or mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR) in hosts offer a practical way of immunizing plants against pathogen ingress [G. Wei, J. W. Klopper and S. Tazun (1991) Phytopathology 81: 1508-1512]. Recently we have reported rhizobacteria elicited alterations in phenolics of chickpea infected by <i>Sclerotium rolfsii </i>[B. K. Sarma, D. P. Singh, S. Mehta, H. B. Singh and U. P. Singh (2002) Journal of Phytopathology 150: 277-282].</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Recently, effectiveness of cow's milk against zucchini squash (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i>) powdery mildew (<i>Sphaerotheca fulginea</i>) has been demonstrated in greenhouse conditions [W. Bettiol (1999) Crop Protection 18:489-492]. Cow milk may have more than one mode of action in controlling zucchini squash powdery mildew. Fresh milk may have a direct effect against <i>S. fulginea </i>due to its germicidal properties [A. J. Salle (1954) Fundamental principles of bacteriology. New York: McGraw-Hill]. Milk contains several salts and amino acids. These substances have been shown to be effective in controlling powdery mildew and other diseases [A. J.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">India is one of the few countries in world, which has contributed richly to the International livestock gene pool and improvement of animal population in world. Cattle and buffalo contribute nearly 15% of the gross national income. The country possesses 23% of world bovine population. Sahiwal is one of the most popular breeds of cow of the subcontinent. It has been exported to Sri Lanka, Kenya and many countries in Latin America and West Indies where a new breed called Jamaica Hope has been evolved out of Sahiwal and Jersey crossbreeds [P. N. Bhat, Handbook of Animal Husbandry, Directorate of Publication and Information on Agriculture, Krishi Anusandhan Bhawan, Pusa, New Delhi, India (1997)]. Thus the traditional information about the use of cow urine an important bio matter which can be used methodically to get better result in controlling plant pathogenic fungi and promoting plant growth should not be ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While work on use of urine for promoting plant growth and controlling plant pathogenic fungi has been conducted in past there has been no clear indication heretofore that any detailed study has been conducted to demonstrate that urine from cow might act as stimulator of the accumulation of nutrients in the plant biomass, proliferation of plant growth promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants, per se. Nevertheless, a cow urine-mediated promotion of plant growth and controlling plant pathogenic fungi, if one were discovered, could find immediate application, e.g., in soils affected by phytopathogens, poor nutrient availability in a desired improvement in crop development. We have found by direct comparison on a variety of plant types that the unique combination of selected plants with cow urine is effective in the enhancement of plant growth and soil health.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention relates to usage of urine from cow which acts as plant and soil health enhancer and application thereof for promoting plant growth and controlling plant pathogenic fungi, said composition comprising urine, neem and garlic, individually or in all possible combinations, the treatment showing stimulation of the accumulation of nutrients in the plant biomass, proliferation of plant growth promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants; and a method for producing the composition.</p>

It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0141">It has been discovered that usage of urine from cow acts as plant and soil health enhancer. Application of cow urine results in promoting plant growth and controlling plant pathogenic fungi, said composition comprising urine, neem leaves and garlic, individually or in all possible combinations, stimulation of proliferation of plant growth promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants and enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0142">Therefore one aspect of the present invention relates to method for screening useful synergistic compositions comprising urine to select those plants that have the potential for promoting plant growth and controlling plant pathogenic fungi, with the treatment showing stimulation of the accumulation of N and P in the plant biomass, proliferation of plant growth promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0143">First fresh urine from healthy indigenous (Sahiwal) cows was collected in morning into clean plastic container. The 1 liter urine was poured into 2 liter capacity copper vessel buried in soil up to its neck for its fermentation up to 30 days, along with neem (250 gm leaves/liter) and/or garlic (100 gm crushed bulbs/liter). After 30 days, using the fermented product either directly or boiling it to concentrate to 0.25 liter, before its application. In yet another combination cow urine was fermented along with neem leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs for 30 days in 2 liter capacity earthen vessel buried in soil up to its neck. After 30 days, using the fermented product either directly or boiling it to concentrate to 0.25 liter, before its application. In yet another combination fermenting neem leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs with water. After 30 days, using the fermented product either directly or boiling it to concentrate to 0.25 liter, before its application. Thus 12 treatments were prepared using urine, neem leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs individually in copper or earthen pot, each, to a final total of 24 treatments. Twenty-four treatments prepared in the previous step are screened to select those, which at a particular concentration promote plant growth under greenhouse conditions as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology, Volume 48, pp. 588-601 (2002)]. In this test seeds of chickpea are grown in non-sterilized soil and treated individually, at a concentration of 1:100 dilution. Earthen pots (of 25 cm diameter) have been found to be of a convenient size to grow chickpea and other plants for the greenhouse test. Each pot was filled with non-sterilized soil. Although sterile soil or any other plant growth supporting material for example like vermiculite may also be used instead of non-sterile soil, it is preferred that non-sterile soil from the field where these treatments are intended to be applied is used in greenhouse test. Tap water was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust the dry soil to 20% moisture with the 24 treatments individually diluted to 1:100. Tap water for control and diluted treatment was added before planting seeds to adjust the dry soil to 15 to 30% moisture. Preferred soil moisture is 20%. Six seeds were added per pot. Data was recorded after 21 days of plant growth with respect to plant height and weight and as plant growth promoter those treatments were selected which cause the treated plants to exhibit greater dry weight.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0144">Next the treatment selected in the previous step is evaluated for its plant growth promotion ability of chickpea, maize, wheat and pea in greenhouse using different dilution in the range of 0 to 1:1000 and selecting those treatments, which at a particular concentration promote plant growth under greenhouse conditions as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal, Current Microbiology, Volume 34, pp. 12-17 (1997)]. In this test seeds of chickpea, maize, wheat and pea are grown in non-sterilized soil. Trays (35×35 cm.) with 16 (4×4) places per tray (each space was of 7 cm. width, 10 cm. depth and 1 cm. apart from each other) have been found to be of a convenient size to grow chickpea, maize, wheat and pea and other plants for the greenhouse test. Each place was filled up to 8 cm. with non-sterilized soil.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0146">Next, the treatments urine+neem and urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel showing good plant growth promotion are subjected to a screening for their ability to suppress phytopathogenic fungi suppressing growth of <i>Fusarium oxysporum </i>f. sp. <i>ciceri, Fusarium oxysporum </i>f. sp. <i>gladioli, Fusarium moniliforme, Alternaria solani, Alternaria alternata, Phytophthora palmivora, Phytophthora nicotianae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Colletotrichum falcatum, Colletotrichum capsici, Penicillium </i>sp., <i>Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, Curvularia lunata </i>and <i>Phoma sorghi </i>under in vitro conditions as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 35: 52-58; C. S. Nautiyal (1997) FEMS Microbiology Ecology 23: 145-158].</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0147">An agar plug inoculum of the fungi to be tested (5-mm square) was then transferred to the center of the plate individually from a source plate of the fungi. Four holes (5 mm diameter) were bored on each NA plate. In each hole 100 μL of the treatments were individually added and in the 4<sup>th </sup>hole sterile water was added as a negative control. After incubation for 5 to 8 days inhibition zones were readily observed in the case of treatments having the biocontrol activity as the fungal growth around the hole was inhibited. While in case of treatments not having biocontrol activity and the hole sterile water was added as a negative control, fungal growth around the hole was not inhibited and the fungi grew around the edge of the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0148">Concentrations of neem (50, 100, 250 and 500 gm/liter) and garlic (10, 50, 100 and 250 gm/liter) in urine were further improved upon by using several combinations and amounts in earthen vessel under in vitro conditions for optimization of its ability to suppress pathogenic fungi and promote plant growth. Amount of neem used is in the range of 50 to 500 gm/liter and for garlic 10 to 250 gm/liter. Preferred amount for neem and garlic is 250 and 100 gm/liter, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0149">Next the treatment containing urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel are subjected for its ability to inhibit growth of the sclerotia of <i>Sclerotia rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani </i>and <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum </i>and chamydospores of <i>Fusarium </i>sp. under in vitro conditions by dipping three-week old similar sized sclerotia/chamydospores collected from NA plates after surface sterilized in various dilutions of the treatments individually, for up to 6 hrs; monitoring the viability of the sclerotia/chamydospores by removing and inoculating 3 batches of 15 sclerotia/chamydospores on NA after incubation at 25° C. for 7 days; recording the viability of sclerotia/chamydospores was recorded in terms of number of germinating sclerotia/chamydospores by visual examination of mycelial growth after 7 days.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0150">The 24 treatments were further tested for their ability to inhibit growth of <i>Sclerotium rolfsii </i>by seed soaking and soil drenching treatment to control collar rot of chickpea seedlings in greenhouse by dipping in 10% dilutions of the treatments individually, as indicated for 2 hrs; for soil drenching treatment adjusting the dry pot soil moisture to 20% with the product diluted 1:100 individually, as stated.</p>

<p id="p-0138" num="0152">Effect of addition of boiled urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel on the plant health, rhizosphere microorganisms and accumulation of N and P of chickpea plants was evaluated. Plant health and the population of rhizosphere microflora was estimated by a previously described procedure [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)] Total N was determined by the Kjeldahl method [J. M. Bremner and C. S. Mulvancy (1982) Nitrogen-total, p. 595-624. In A. L. Page (ed.), Methods of soil analysis, part 2, 2<sup>nd </sup>ed., Agronomy, no. 9, American Society of Agronomy, Madison, Wis., U.S.A.]. Plant tissues were digested in a mixture of 15 ml of HClO<sub>4 </sub>and 5 ml of HNO<sub>3 </sub>and phosphorus was determined calorimetrically by the vanado-molybdate method [H. L. S. Tandon, M. P. Cescas and E. H. Tyner (1968) Soil Science Society of America Proceedings 32: 48-51].</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0153">Next boiled urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel is added to the soil to elucidate its effect on rhizosphere microorganisms by determining the percentage of bacteria among the resident population, demonstrating plant growth promotion, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance and antagonism towards plant pathogenic fungi. Chickpea plants were grown for 4 weeks in the presence and absence of 1:10 diluted boiled urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0154">To isolate rhizosphere bacteria chickpea roots were thoroughly washed with tap water for two minutes to remove all loosely adhering soil particles, followed by washing with sterile 0.85% (w/v) saline Milli Q water (MQW). The roots were then macerated in 0.85% saline MQW with a mortar and pestle. Serial dilutions of the homogenate were then plated on NA agar plates as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 33: 1-6]. One thousand bacterial representatives of the predominant morphologically distinct colonies present on the plates were selected from NA plates and purified by sub culturing an individual strain on NA plates to obtain a pure culture for further screening.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0155">Each isolate was stored in an aqueous solution of 30% glycerol at −25° C. One thousand bacterial strains were used to determine the % of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria present in the heterogenous population of the bacteria. Out of 1000 bacterial strains 100 bacterial representatives of the predominant morphologically distinct colonies were randomly used to determine the changes in the % of bacteria among the resident population demonstrating plant growth promotion, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance and antagonism towards plant pathogenic fungi.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0156">Individual strains of the 100 bacteria were subjected to screening for selecting bacteria having potential for plant growth promotion. Bacterial inoculum for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seeds was prepared by scraping 48 h grown culture from plates with 10 ml of 0.85% saline water. Maize seeds were surface sterilized by gently shaking (80 R.P.M. on a reciprocal shaker at 28° C.) with 70% ethanol (5 min.), 20% bleach Chlorox (10 min.), followed by three rinses in sterile water. After surface sterilization seeds were soaked in the bacterial suspension (1×10<sup>8 </sup>CFU/ml) for 4 h at 28° C. on a reciprocal shaker at 100 R.P.M. Control seeds (non bacterized) were soaked in 0.85% saline water washed from uninoculated plates. Bacterization levels of seeds were determined by agitating 4 seeds from each treatment and plated after serial dilution on NA plate. Mean cfu/seed were determined by averaging the cfu/gm values of three populations in three replicates per treatment after 48 h incubation of the plates at 28° C. Tap water was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust the soil to 15 to 30% moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0157">Preferred soil moisture is 20%. Trays (35×35 cm.) with 16 (4×4) places per tray (each space was of 7 cm. width, 10 cm. depth and 1 cm. apart from each other) were used, to grow maize. Each place was filled up to 8 cm. with non-sterilized soil. Tap water (25 ml.) was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust the soil to 20% moisture. Four bacterized seed was added per hole. The experiment in greenhouse was carried out in four different sets of 16 maize seedlings each, for non-bacterized (control) and bacterized seeds. In each set, data of 21-days-old seedlings was noted with respect to dry weight of plants. For the bacterial strains to be plant growth promoter, the bacterized seedlings must have averaged at least 10% higher dry weight than comparable non-bacterized plants [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)].</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0158">Quantitative estimation of phosphate solubilization capability of the 100 bacterial strains was carried out in triplicate by using National Botanical Research Institute's Phosphate solubilizing medium (NBRIP) in broth. The method has been described by Mehta and Nautiyal [S. Mehta and C. S. Nautiyal (2001) Current Microbiology 43:51-56].</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0159">Next individual strains of the 100 bacteria were subjected to screening for abiotic stress tolerance. The stress tolerance of the strains towards salt (NaCl), pH, and temperature was tested by growing them individually on nutrient broth (NB) under various stress conditions, e.g., like 6% salt (NaCl), pH (3 and 11), and at temperature (5 and 55° C.) stress were grown overnight (14-16 hrs). For 6% salt (NaCl), pH (3 and 11) stress cultures were grown overnight at 30° C. Serial dilutions of each sample were spotted (25 μl) onto NA plates, and incubated at 30° C. in triplicate as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)]. Growth of bacterial strains having the abiotic stress tolerance ability was clearly visible with in 2-3 days of incubation of the plates at 30° C.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0160">Individual strains of the 100 bacteria were subjected to screening for bacteria having potential for suppressing phytopathogenic fungi namely <i>Fusarium oxysporum </i>f. sp. <i>ciceri, Colletotrichum falcatum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Alternaria solani, Penicillium </i>sp., <i>Pythium aphanidermatum, Phytophthora palmivora, Curvularia lunata, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Aspergillus niger </i>and <i>Phoma sorghi </i>under in vitro conditions as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 35: 52-58]. Bacterial colonies on NA plates were streaked around the edge of a 90-mm diameter petri plate and the plates were incubated at 28° C. for 1 to 2 days. An agar plug inoculum of the fungi to be tested (5-mm square) was then transferred to the center of the plate individually from a source plate of the fungi. After incubation for 5 to 8 days inhibition zones were readily observed in the case of bacterial strains having the biocontrol activity.</p>

Preferred moisture is 35% before its addition to soil as seed or furrow treatments. For furrow-treatment, formulation was directly applied all over the open furrow containing seeds and covered after treatment C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)]. Chickpea plants were grown for 4 weeks to elucidate its effect on rhizosphere microorganisms as described above by determining the percentage of bacteria among the resident population, demonstrating plant growth promotion, phosphate solubilization, and antagonism towards plant pathogenic fungi.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0162">Next effect of addition of boiled urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel was evaluated on the total phenolic contents of chickpea plants. In this test, seeds of chickpea are grown in non-sterilized soil and treated individually, at a concentration of 1:10 dilution. Earthen pots (of 25 cm diameter) have been found to be of a convenient size to grow chickpea and other plants for the greenhouse test. Each pot was filled with non-sterilized soil. Tap water was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust the dry soil to 20% moisture with the 24 treatments individually diluted to 1:10. Tap water for control and diluted treatment was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust the dry soil to 20%. Four seeds were added per hole. Data was noted after 30 days of plant growth with respect to total phenolic compounds in the leaf and root of treated chickpea, compared with un-treated control and total phenolics were estimated spectrophotometrically using the Prussian Blue method as modified by Graham [H.

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Effect of Different Dilution of Boiled Urine+Neem Fermented in Earthen Vessel on Plant Growth Promotion Ability of Chickpea, Maize, Wheat and Pea in Greenhouse</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0178">The experiment to examine the effect of boiled urine+neem fermented in earthen vessel as described in Example 1, on plant growth promotion ability of chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), wheat (<i>Triticum vulgare</i>) and pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) in greenhouse was carried out. Trays (35×35 cm.) with 16 (4×4) places per tray (each space was of 7 cm. width, 10 cm. depth and 1 cm. apart from each other) were used, to grow chickpea, maize, wheat and pea. Each place was filled up to 8 cm. with non-sterilized soil. Tap water was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust the dry soil to 20% moisture with the product diluted as stated. Four seeds were added per hole. The experiment in greenhouse was carried out in four different sets of 16 chickpea, maize, wheat and pea seedlings each, for non-treated (control) and treated seeds. In each set, data of 30-days-old seedlings was noted with respect to dry weight of plants. Results demonstrated that 1:10 dilution of the product urine+neem fermented in earthen vessel treated plants demonstrated best plant dry weight, compared with un-treated control, followed by 1:100 dilution (Table 2).</p>

<p id="p-0169" num="0183">Effect of various concentrations of neem and garlic in various combinations and amounts (gm/liter) as indicated in Table 4 on the product containing fermented in earthen vessel under in vitro conditions for ability to suppress <i>Phytophthora palmivora </i>was evaluated as follows: An agar plug inoculum of the <i>P. palmivora </i>(5-mm square) was transferred to the center of the plate. Four holes (5 mm diameter) were bored on each NA plate. In each hole 100 μL of the treatments were individually added and in the 4<sup>th </sup>hole sterile water was added as a negative control. While in case of treatments not having biocontrol activity and the hole sterile water was added as a negative control, fungal growth around the hole was not inhibited and the fungi grew around the edge of the hole.

After incubation for 5 days inhibition zones were readily observed in the case of treatments having the biocontrol activity as the fungal growth around the hole was inhibited. While in case of treatments not having biocontrol activity, <i>P. palmivora </i>growth around the hole was not inhibited and the fungi grew around the edge of the hole (Table 4).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0184">The experiment in greenhouse was carried out in four different sets of 16 wheat seedlings each, for non-treated (control) and treated seeds as described in Example 3 using 1:100 dilution of the treatments, individually.

<p id="p-0173" num="0187">The product containing urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel, obtained by the procedure outlined in Example 1 was screened for its ability to inhibit growth of the sclerotia of <i>Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani </i>and <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum </i>and chamydospores of <i>Fusarium </i>sp. under in vitro conditions as follows: Three-weeks old similar sized sclerotia/chamydospores collected from NA plates were surface sterilized and dipped in the treatment individually, as indicated for up to 6 hrs. In the control set the sclerotia/chamydospores were suspended in sterile distilled water. The viability of the sclerotia/chamydospores was monitored by removing and inoculating 3 batches of 15 sclerotia/chamydospores on NA after incubation at 28° C. for 7 days. Viability of sclerotia/chamydospores was recorded in terms of number of germinating sclerotia/chamydospores by visual examination of mycelial growth after 7 days. After incubation for 7 days mycelial growth was readily visible in the case of treatments does not having biocontrol activity, as fungal growth around the sclerotia was not inhibited and mycelia grew around the sclerotia on the plate (Table 5). On the contrary after incubation for 7 days mycelial growth was not visible in the case of treatments having biocontrol activity, as fungal growth around the sclerotia was inhibited and mycelia did not grew around the sclerotia on the plate (Table 5). Product containing urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel demonstrated that sclerotia of <i>Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani </i>and <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum </i>and chamydospores of <i>Fusarium </i>sp. was inhibited in 4, 2, 4 and 2 hrs respectively, under in vitro conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0177" num="0191">The product containing urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel, obtained by the procedure outlined in Example 1 was screened for its ability to control leaf spot disease of field grown betelvine caused by <i>Alternaria alternata </i>as follows: The field experiment for management of leaf spot disease of betelvine with the help of various concentrations of the product containing urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel was conducted in the conservatory at the National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India in a randomized block design. The conservatory in which the experiments were carried out was about 5 meter high and covered on all the sides with wire nettings supported on angled iron pillars. Paddy straw was used on these nettings to provide suitable conditions of shade and moisture needed for betelvine cultivation. One-meter wide beds were prepared with a width of 35 cm and 10 cm high ridges. The setts for sowing were selected from single node cuttings from two year old vines growing in beds of 4.5×3 m<sup>2 </sup>area.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0192">The cuttings were planted on either side of the ridges in April 2001, on a field plot naturally infected with <i>Alternaria alternata </i>and covered with paddy straw and sprinkled with water 4-5 times a day for nearly one month creating suitable moisture conditions for the proper germination of vines. In each bed 15 vines of the plants were maintained for each treatment. Disease symptoms on lower leaves were visible by July, 2001. First spraying of the product was done at that time and was repeated by 5 more sprays at 15 days' interval till September, 2001. Disease intensity was noted 15 days after 5<sup>th </sup>spray of the product. The products containing urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel demonstrated ability to control leaf spot disease of field grown betelvine caused by <i>Alternaria alternata </i>at 20% concentration.</p>

<p id="p-0187" num="0201">Effect of addition of the product containing urine+neem+garlic fermented in earthen vessel, obtained by the procedure outlined in Example 1, on the carriers to disperse the subject treatment such as peat, vermicompost and press mud to 35% moisture and applied as furrow treatment. For furrow-treatment, formulation was directly applied all over the open furrow containing seeds and covered after treatment. Chickpea plants were grown for 4 weeks to elucidate its effect on rhizosphere microorganisms as described above by determining the percentage of bacteria among the resident population, demonstrating plant growth promotion, phosphate solubilization, and antagonism towards plant pathogenic fungi. Changes in the percentage of bacteria among the resident population, demonstrating plant growth promotion, phosphate solubilization and antagonism towards plant pathogenic fungi of treated microorganisms in the chickpea rhizosphere was observed, compared with un-treated control. As indicated in the Table 10, except for peat % population of plant growth promotery, phosphate solubilizers and fungal antagonist bacterial population increased in the treated chickpea rhizosphere, compared with control (without carrier).</p>
