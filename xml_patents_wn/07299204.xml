<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Members vote on which investments within an agreed upon list of investments they believe should be bought and sold. Members can be general members or experts. Records of each member's voting history are retained and compared against market data showing actual gains and losses associated with each investment. Members whose votes are consistent with actual performance (they made good selections) are given higher weights; members whose votes are inconsistent with actual performance (they made bad selections) are given lower weight. Investment assets are bought and sold based on the collective vote of the members. Members are rewarded for a good voting record by receiving an additional share of the incremental profit of the collective investment.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to an investment processing system for managing financial assets, and more particularly to an investment decision-making process using prior decision making information related to a group of individual investors.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Traditionally, individual investors have used investment brokers to invest in the security markets. Such brokers may provide individual investors with limited advice, however that advice often does not yield the desired investment returns. More recently, the Internet has allowed individual investors to make their own investment decisions through online brokerage firms. However, individual investment is difficult because the investor must wisely select stocks or investments to buy and sell from so many different securities in the stock markets. Additionally, the individual investor is exposed to higher risk because he or she does not have sufficient information about the stocks, or a thorough understanding of the markets, or the skills and knowledge to evaluate various investments from different industries and countries. As a result of these risks, some investors gain from their investment decisions while many other investors may lose, particularly in markets with volatile conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an effort to minimize risks in investment trading, some individual investors invest in mutual finds managed by investment professionals. Managed mutual fund investment purportedly reduces risks because the investment firm uses professionals to select diverse stocks based on such criteria as industry, economic conditions and risk potential. The fund managers have full responsibilities for managing and making trading decisions for the fund. Various fund managers have different research, financial knowledge and analytical skills. Accordingly, the returns for mutual funds vary depending on the fund managers. The individual investors, however, have minimal control over management of the funds. Thus, individuals investing capital in the mutual fund companies are disadvantaged. For example, the individual investor who possesses a good ability to select investments, but has no control over the management of the funds, will not utilize his or her decisions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A collective trading system according to the invention creates an entirely new investment possibility for a group of individual investors to collectively and actively participate in an investment decision-making process which uses prior decision information to select investments or stocks. The stocks are bought or sold in the financial markets. Using the prior decision information of individual investors, the individual investors collectively select more winning stocks. Investors are more likely to get better returns with lower risks. The returns will benefit all participating investors and not just particular individual investors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The collective trading system includes Weighted Winning Stock Selection (WWSS) coefficients which are used to represent historical decision information about past stock selection by member investors. The WWSS coefficients are then used to assist with future decisions and distribute related gains or losses which result from trading in the markets. The participating individual member investors in the system make decisions which are weighted according to each investor's historical performances in selecting stocks. In particular, past performances in decision making of stock selection are reflected in WWSS coefficients. For example, for individual participating investors who select more “winning” stocks which are traded and realize a profit, their WWSS coefficients will be greater than the WWSS coefficients of those individual investors who select less “winning” stocks. With greater WWSS coefficients, individual investors are rewarded more if their decisions select more winning stocks. WWSS coefficients provide rewarding incentives which encourage the participating investors in the system to enhance their knowledge and research abilities about companies and markets, and to develop a better understanding in financial investment such that decisions will result in improved returns for traded investments.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the collective investment trading system <b>10</b> is illustrated with investors <b>15</b> and stock market <b>20</b>. Although a stock market is illustrated here, it will be understood that the invention may be applied to any asset buying and selling function. The collective investment trading system <b>10</b> allows investors <b>15</b> to execute investment decision regarding the stock market <b>20</b> in a unique manner by collectively managing trading of stocks or any other investments.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The collective investment trading system <b>10</b> includes a list of investments <b>25</b>, a buy-sell decision engine <b>30</b>, a voting records assessment engine <b>35</b>, an investor database <b>40</b>, a data store of stock market data <b>45</b>, and a transaction engine <b>50</b>. For a trading period in which a decision will be made for buying or selling stocks, the list of investments <b>25</b> is provided to the buy-sell engine <b>30</b>. Investors <b>15</b> are able to vote on the stocks in the list of investments <b>25</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the list of investments is a pre-selected group of stocks to which the investors <b>15</b> distribute their votes. The buy-sell decision engine <b>30</b> uses the votes and voting record assessments <b>35</b> to select which stocks are to be traded.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The voting records assessments <b>35</b> are based on prior vote history stored as part of the investor data <b>45</b> which indicates prior decisions made by each investor. The voting records assessments <b>35</b> may use other data such as, but not limited to, stock market data <b>45</b>. For example, all votes which an investors cast for particular stocks during a trading period are represented in the vote history <b>46</b>. The vote history is used to determine how well individual investors select stocks. If investors select stocks which are “winning” stock and provide an economic gain, then the voting record assessment will reflect such individual capability in making good decisions. If, however, investors select stocks which are “winning” stock and provide an economic loss, then the voting record assessment will reflect such a lack of individual capability in making good decisions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The vote history <b>46</b>, along with other data, is stored in investor database <b>40</b>. The voting record assessment <b>35</b> provides a weighting to the votes. For example, the investor with a good vote history will have a larger voting record assessment, and the votes which he or she places on each stock will be increase by further weights. Comparably, the investor with a bad vote history will have a smaller voting record assessment, and the votes which he or she places on each stock will be decreased accordingly. The buy-sell engine <b>30</b> totals weighted votes for all stocks. The totals are provided to the transaction engine <b>50</b> which buys and sells the stocks based on the totals. If stocks are sold, then an economic gain may be realized and distributed to the investors <b>15</b> via the transaction engine. The distribution of money is determined using the voting record assessment as weights which distribute gains based on individual investor's voting capability, However, it should be appreciated that distribution may be performed by any appropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the further details of one embodiment of the collective investment trading system <b>90</b> are shown. Participating investors <b>265</b> communicate with the collective weighted winning stock selection trading system <b>112</b> via the Internet <b>114</b> or other suitable interface. The collective investment trading system <b>90</b> sends data to and receives data from financial markets <b>100</b>. While Internet communicatioin is presently preferred, it should be appreciated that any suitable communication network or system may be used. The participating investors <b>265</b> may utilize a variety of systems including electronic devices <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>180</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>240</b> and <b>260</b>, which collect and display data to users. It should be appreciated that any appropriate electronic device such as, but not limited to, a personal computer, wired or wireless device, may be used. In the exemplary embodiment, electronic devices <b>120</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>180</b> are associated with investors categorized as general members. Electronic devices <b>200</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>240</b> and <b>260</b> are associated with investors categorized as expert users. However, it should be appreciated that investors may be categorized by any criteria which is related to investing or decision making.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The total number of investors is N (0&lt;N=m<sub>1</sub>+m<sub>2</sub>). There are m<sub>1 </sub>general members (0&lt;m<sub>1</sub>&lt;N) and m<sub>2 </sub>expert users (0&lt;m<sub>2</sub>&lt;N). The general members are investors who may lack credentials to distinguish them as experts. The experts are those investors who have the required expertise, educational training, or are professionals in stock markets, investments, or any other appropriate financially related discipline. General member <b>120</b> may become an expert if this member acquires sufficient knowledge and skills. It should be appreciated that investors may be classified into more than two groups depending on the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">All investors, the general members and experts, collectively participate in the decision making process to trade stocks in the markets. This decision process is different from those methods that are currently used in traditional investment industry in that the traditional investment decisions are made by the individual investors who invest according to their own discretions by online brokerage firms, or by letting the mutual fund companies to invest for these investors in different funds.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The participating investors <b>265</b>, using the electronic devices <b>120</b>-<b>260</b>, send and receive information related to the investment decision to trading system <b>112</b> via the Internet <b>114</b>. Accordingly, individual investors make collective investment decisions at block <b>110</b>. An investment decision may be buying or selling of financial investments. Each one of the investors supplies votes to the firm computer <b>106</b>. The votes are indicative of each investor's desire to buy or sell particular investments. The votes or individual decisions are used by the computer <b>106</b> to process data and perform computations at block <b>104</b>. The individual decisions are weighted according to past decision history. Select investments or stocks are provided such that transactions of buying and selling securities occur at block <b>102</b>. The transactions are executed in financial markets <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After trading the investments or stocks in the financial markets <b>100</b>, an economic gain or loss may occur from the selling or buying of the stocks <b>102</b>. For example, the selling of investments will yield a positive or negative return, whereas the purchasing of any investments will not provide a return. Accordingly, firm computer <b>106</b> processes data related to the selling or buying of investments at block <b>104</b> to produce gains or losses. Distribution of gains or losses to investors is performed at block <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the preferred embodiment, trading system <b>112</b> utilizes voting decisions and gains or losses which are distributed according to each investor's past decision history which is represented by weighted winning stock selection (WWSS) coefficients. The WWSS coefficients in the collective investment trading system provide an incentive and encourage investors to proactively participate in the trading activities. Each investor's prior decisions in trading activities modify and update the value of WWSS coefficients. WWSS coefficients are then used to weight future voting decisions and/or gain/loss distributions. For example, the more stocks which yield a positive return or “winning” stocks which an investor selects, the individual investor's WWSS coefficient increases in value. As a result, investors with higher WWSS coefficients are given more effective decision power to vote and are rewarded because their votes are weighted with the WWSS coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">WWSS coefficients also may be used to assure every investor gets some share of the gains related to trading of the stocks based on contributions to better decisions in the process of selecting “winning” stocks. This encourages all levels of investors to actively become involved in the investment trading system. In such a trading system, investing novices are not penalized because they have difficulty in selecting winning stocks. Rather, they are encouraged to collectively invest and become involved in the investment decisions. Once involved, investors will be more responsible to manage the mutual fund in which they invested.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method of collective decision making of investments begins at start block <b>270</b>. For purposes of illustration, investments are stocks; however, it should be appreciated that any assets of value may be used, including, but not limited to, debts, equities, bonds, or any other merchandise/commodities that can be legally traded in any domestic or international markets. In the preferred embodiment, member investors recommend stocks at block <b>272</b>. The recommended stocks are representative of possible stocks which may be provided to investors. The recommendation of stocks focuses investors to a particular group of stocks for which votes may be cast. For example, recommended stocks may provide a group of ten stocks which are presented to investors. In this manner, individual investors focus knowledge, research and decision making on the recommended stocks. Investors make decisions and vote the stocks at block <b>274</b>. The voting is a weighted voting process based on prior voting history associated with the investors and represented by WWSS coefficients. For each recommended stock, the votes from individual investors are used to determine the total voting points.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Stocks with sufficient voting points are bought or sold at <b>276</b>. For example, sufficient voting points may be assessed as higher than a predetermined minimum point amount specified by the system. After trading, an economic gain or loss may be calculated depending on whether stocks are bought or sold. A need to calculate gains or losses is determined at block <b>278</b>. If there is no need to calculate gains or losses, a new collective decision making will begin at start block <b>270</b>. If there is a need to calculate gains or losses, for example, if stocks are sold, then a distribution is determined and may be based on WWSS coefficients and processing data at block <b>280</b>. Accordingly, gains or losses are distributed to participating investors at block <b>282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, start block <b>300</b> initiates the method of participating investors selecting or voting stock. Through checking the financial market situations and the performances of the stocks in the markets, each investor may recommend stocks at block <b>310</b>. For example, investors recommend buying stocks from all available stocks in the market, and recommend stocks for selling from the stocks that are currently owned by the mutual fund. The recommending time period may be minutes, hours or days, depending on predetermined rules of the investment trading system. The investors send data indicative of “recommended” stocks to the company's computer at block <b>320</b>. The computer registers all “recommended” stocks received from the investors at block <b>330</b>. After the recommendation period, the data is processed at block <b>340</b>. The total number of recommendations is determined for each stock. A predetermined threshold which indicates the minimum number of investors required to recommend the stock may be set, for example, at least k<sub>1 </sub>investors must recommend any particular stock. Whether the stock is recommended by at least the threshold k<sub>1 </sub>of investors is determined at block <b>350</b>. If the threshold is not met, then no action is taken at block <b>360</b>. If stock is recommended by at least the threshold number, then data is sent to member investors so that they may vote on recommended stocks at block <b>370</b>. The threshold number k<sub>1 </sub>avoids too many stocks being sent for member investors to vote, and therefore avoids a situation in which member investors are overwhelmed and votes are not optimally used to select stocks.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, investor members vote the recommended stocks at block <b>400</b> for trading. In the exemplary embodiment, investor members are categorized into members and experts since the general members and experts have different perspectives of the stocks to be sold or bought. In more complex investing processes, these investor members may be classified into more than two categories, and in less complex investing processes, investor members may be classified into a single category.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, members vote stocks at block <b>410</b> and experts vote stocks at block <b>450</b>. For the investors, each may access the list of the stocks that have been recommended. Each investor, member or expert is provided with a predetermined amount of points which are available for voting the recommended stocks. Points may be provided in an amount such that votes may be distributed to the stocks in a flexible manner. For example, each general member may be given 100 points to vote. The general member may “weight” his or her votes to different stocks. For example, if there are ten recommended stocks upon which a general member may cast votes, then of the ten recommended stocks, the votes may be distributed as follows:</p>

thus, the votes for each stock are “weighted.” According to each investor's expectation that a stock's value will increase or decrease, the investor may weight more votes to his or her preferred stocks by directing more points on particularly preferred stocks. Restrictions may be imposed on the maximum or minimum points that an investor may vote on an individual stock. For example, the minimum voting points can be as few as 5 points, and the maximum point as many as 50 points. A participating member investor is given 100 points to vote. This member may vote all the recommended stocks, Stock A with 5 points, Stock B with 10 points, Stock C with 10 points, Stock D with 50 points, and Stock E with 25 points. Alternatively, an investor may choose to not vote for all the stocks, for example, 2 stocks, each with 50 points, or vote as many as 20 stocks, each with 5 points. The distribution of votes depends on how an investor adjusts voting points to the stocks. Once the trading period available to vote terminates, based on time or other appropriate criteria, then the data is transmitted to the computer system and is saved at block <b>415</b> and block <b>455</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">All the investors' voting data may be saved in a database or WWSS coefficient data file <b>420</b> and <b>460</b>. The WWSS coefficient data file <b>420</b> and <b>460</b> also provide each investor's WWSS coefficient at blocks <b>425</b> and <b>465</b>. A decision is determined based on WWSS coefficients and voted stock points. The system adjusts each participating investor's voting points by WWSS coefficients at blocks <b>430</b> and <b>470</b>. Accordingly, investors' voting points are “weighted” according to the success of prior voting records. For example, participating investors who voted for more “winning” stocks have larger WWSS coefficients than participating investors who voted for less “winning stocks.” The relative amounts of “winning” stocks may be based on a percentage manner, on a larger net gain of stocks, or any other appropriate evaluation criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The differences among the WWSS coefficients of participating investors provide successful management of the stocks of the mutual fund. Since the WWSS coefficients are calculated by past voting history, the more winning stocks an investor selects, the larger his or her WWSS coefficient is valued, and thus the investor possesses more effective decision power compared to other investing members. This motivates participating investors to successfully manage the stocks by encouraging good decisions which select “winning” stocks. WWSS coefficients are optimal for making decisions based on investors with prior history of success in selecting the “winning” stock and provide better future predictions of selecting “winning” stock. WWSS coefficients also avoid mistakes that may be made by each individual investor because decisions are considered by more than one who may otherwise easily make a mistake.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the exemplary embodiment, all weighted votes or points are summed for each stock at blocks <b>435</b> and <b>475</b>. Further weighting based on past performance may be used. Group WWSS coefficients unique for each group are determined. For example, general member group's performances and expert group's performances in the voting process are used to determine a group WWSS coefficient for each. In the exemplary embodiment, the weighted stock points for each investor are adjusted by a group WWSS coefficient of the investor's association at blocks <b>445</b> and <b>485</b>. For example, if the investor is an expert, then the expert WWSS coefficient is used. Also, if the experts' voting records of the winning stock are better than that of the general members' voting records, then the expert group's WWSS coefficient is greater than that of the general member group's WWSS coefficient. Weighting more for the group that has a better prior history of selecting “winning” stocks provides an additional methodology in selecting financial investments. WWSS group coefficients may be stored and are retrieved from the WWSS data file <b>440</b> and <b>480</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The completion of weighting voting points for all individual investors, and any group weighting (the general member group and the expert group) allows the computer to add all the weighted voting points for each stock at block <b>490</b>. A list of stocks and the associated total voting points received by all the participating investors is produced. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the decision to buy or sell the stocks is executed at block <b>500</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, a threshold value X<sub>1 </sub>is determined. A decision whether an action is to take to trade this stock or not is based on whether the total points of a stock is greater than a threshold a block <b>505</b>. If a stock has total voting points less than or equal to X<sub>1</sub>, then the stock is not to be traded at block <b>510</b>. If a stock has voting points greater than X<sub>1</sub>, then the stock is to be traded in the financial markets at block <b>515</b>. It should be appreciated that any appropriate criteria may be used to determine if the stock is to be traded, such as, but not limited to, a relative ranking among all recommended stocks in a trade period. Whether to calculate a return is determined at block <b>516</b>. If the trading of stocks does not require calculation of a return, for example, if all of the stocks were bought, then the voting data is saved and begins another trading process at block <b>518</b>. The saved voting data is used in the calculations to update the WWSS coefficients. Another trading period starts at block <b>300</b>. If the trading of stocks requires calculation of a return, then calculation of an updated investors' WWSS coefficients is executed at block <b>520</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, each investor's updated or new WWSS coefficients is based on three determinations from block <b>530</b>. Accordingly, as illustrated at <b>525</b> the WWSS coefficient for each investor is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>WWSS<sub>i </sub>(0)=<i>e</i><sub>1</sub>*WWSS<sub>i1 </sub><i>+e</i><sub>2</sub>*WWSS<sub>i2</sub><i>+e</i><sub>3</sub>*WWSS<sub>i3</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where WWSS<sub>i </sub>(0) is the current weighted winning stock selection coefficient from the latest trading; WWSS<sub>i1 </sub>is the individual weighted coefficient for winning percentage (for example, if a participating investor voted 8 of 10 stocks are winning stocks, they this investor's WWSS<sub>1 </sub>is 0.8.); WWSS<sub>i2 </sub>is the weighted coefficient for individual net gain from the trading of the stocks (if two investors have the same winning percentage in their stock selection, the net gains may be different; the larger the net gains, the greater the WWSS<sub>i2</sub>); WWSS<sub>i3 </sub>is the coefficient from the group's voting performance (if the participating investor is from the general member group, the general member's WWSS is used); e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, and e<sub>3 </sub>are weighted constants for the collective weighted winning stock selection coefficients WWSS<sub>i1</sub>, WWSS<sub>i2</sub>, and WWSS<sub>i3 </sub>and may be predetermined by the collective trading system. For example, e<sub>1</sub>=0.75, e<sub>2</sub>=0.15, and e<sub>3</sub>=0.1.
</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After obtaining the WWSS<sub>i</sub>(0) for each investor, the investors' updated WWSS<sub>i </sub>coefficients from previous participation in voting are determined. In the exemplary embodiment, WWSS<sub>i </sub>coefficients may be based on all previous trading actions, thereby depending on an investor's overall performance in the process. The number of prior trading actions used to calculate the WWSS<sub>i </sub>coefficients is denoted by n, a positive number specified by the trading system. For example, the system can specify n=1, 2 . . . or 100, etc., of trading periods, depending on the objective of the portfolio or on maximizing a possibility of selecting more winning stock. Therefore, the WWSS<sub>i </sub>is calculated by weighting all previous n WWSS coefficients that are calculated after each trading process at block <b>535</b> based on the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>WWSS<sub>i </sub><i>=f</i><sub>i</sub>(0)*WWSS<sub>i</sub>(0)+<i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(1)*WWSS<sub>i</sub>(1)+ . . . +<i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>n</i>)*WWSS<sub>i</sub>(<i>n</i>),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where i=0, 1, . . . n are the trading periods the most recent prior trading period (0) to the least recent one (n) for an “effective action period.” For example, assuming today is Mar. 10, 2000, the most recent trading date, if the system trades stocks once a day and counts six (6) trading days (assuming stock markets do not open on weekends) as the “effective action period” to compute the weighted winning stock selection coefficients, then i=0 is Mar. 10, 2000, i=1 is Mar. 9, 2000, . . . , and i=6 is Mar. 3, 2000. Also, f<sub>i</sub>(0), f<sub>i</sub>(1), . . . , and f<sub>i</sub>(6) are previous participation functions the weighted wining stock selection constants which correspond to the respect trading days. The calculation of the WWSS<sub>i </sub>coefficients for all the participating investors based on previous participation in voting is executed at block <b>542</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The previous participation functions may be selected in any appropriate manner. For example, the most recent previous participation functions are weighted more than functions associated with earlier trading periods. The previous participation functions may be calculated by any appropriate methods. For example, by the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>k</i>)=|(<i>n−k</i>)|/Σ|(<i>n−j</i>)|; (<i>j=</i>0, 1, 2, . . . <i>, n</i>) or:<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>alternatively, <i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>k</i>)=(<i>n−k</i>)<sup>2</sup>/Σ(<i>n−j</i>)<sup>2</sup>; (j=0, 1, 2, . . . <i>, n</i>),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>where f<sub>i</sub>(0)≧f<sub>i</sub>(1)≧ . . . ≧<i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>n</i>)≧0 and <i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(0)+<i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(1)+ . . . +<i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>n</i>)=1 (0&gt;<i>n</i>).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
For example, if the collective weighted wining stock selection trading system uses 6 days as the effective trading action period, a set of previous participation functions may be chosen: f<sub>i</sub>(0)=0.333, f<sub>i</sub>(1)=0.267, f<sub>i</sub>(2)=0.200, f<sub>i</sub>(3)=0.133, f<sub>i</sub>(4)=0.067, and f<sub>i</sub>(5)=0.000 such that 0.333+0.267+0.200+0.133+0.067+0.000=1.
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the exemplary embodiment, more recent previous participation functions yield a greater value than less recent previous participation functions, and thus provide a greater weight as more recent performance more accurately reflects the future performance of an investor in selecting the winning stocks. As investors in the trading system are involved in the learning and skill enhancement process, performances may improve, thus more heavily weighting recent coefficients also reflects this attribute. Each time a new coefficient is calculated and added to the records, the more recent coefficients are relied upon more than later coefficients. Therefore, there are n coefficients in the system for each individual investor. Alternatively, one or more of these n coefficients may be set to zero and therefore remove a term from the calculations the new coefficient WWSS.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the exemplary embodiment, further weighting of WWSS coefficient may be implemented. General member group's WWSS coefficient and the expert group's WWSS coefficient are calculated at block <b>540</b>. For the general member group:

</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The WWSS coefficients for both the general member group and the expert group are more heavily weighted in the recent voting records than the past records because the recent records are more accurately reflect the subject's performance, and therefore have a better prediction to select more wining stocks in future's voting actions. The weighted constants may be determined by methods well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After computing all the WWSS<sub>i</sub>, WWSS<sub>GM</sub>, and WWSS<sub>EX </sub>coefficients, the computer system updates the corresponding coefficients and is ready for next trading action. For example, WWSS<sub>i</sub>(n−1) is updated to WWSS<sub>i</sub>(n); WWSS<sub>i</sub>(n−2) is updated to WWSS<sub>i</sub>(n−1), . . . ; WWSS<sub>i</sub>(1) is updated to WWSS<sub>i</sub>(2); and WWSS<sub>i</sub>(0) is updated to WWSS<sub>i</sub>(1). The WWSS coefficients are used in subsequent trading actions to determine a new WWSS<sub>i</sub>(0). Similar calculation updates for coefficients WWSS<sub>GM </sub>and WWSS<sub>EX </sub>are also performed. Thus, updated new sets of WWSS coefficients are available for the next round of trading action. The new WWSS coefficients are updated at block <b>545</b> in the database <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the WWSS coefficients are used to distribute the gains or losses from the trading action at block <b>600</b>. A determination of whether gains are available occurs at block <b>605</b>. If there is a gain after trading the stocks, then the gain is distributed to participating investors at block <b>610</b>. The distribution of the gain to the member investors is based on each individual investor's performance in selecting the winning stocks, and may additionally be based on the performance of each group either as a general member group or as an expert group. The total gain, illustrated at <b>615</b>, is based on the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>G=G</i><sub>1</sub><i>+G</i><sub>2</sub><i>=a</i><sub>1</sub><i>*G+a</i><sub>2</sub><i>*G</i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where G<sub>1 </sub>is the distribution provided to each individual based on the number of individually owned shares at block <b>620</b>, and G<sub>2 </sub>is the distribution provided to individuals based on prior voting history performance or WWSS coefficients at block <b>625</b>. The distributed gains may be further determined by adjustment coefficients. The adjustment coefficients a<b>1</b> and a<b>2</b> may be predetermined based on an optimal distributed among the member investors. For example, a<sub>1</sub>=0.75 and a<sub>2</sub>=0.25. Accordingly, G<sub>1</sub>=a<sub>1</sub>*G and G<sub>2</sub>=a<sub>2</sub>*G.
</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">G<sub>1 </sub>is the portion of gains that is distributed according to shares of stocks which each member investor owns (the investor's performance is not considered). This provides a minimal gain to member investors who did not select winning stocks. This encourages individuals to join the trading system. For example, if every share of stock gains two dollars from a trading period, and an investor owns 200 shares in the portfolio, then this investor receives $2×200=$400. Thus, no matter how well or how poorly each investor does in voting, a distribution will be realized based on ownership of shares.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">G<sub>2 </sub>is the portion of gains that is distributed to the member investors according to each investor's performance in voting. It is proportional to the investor's WWSS coefficient which may be retrieved from WWSS data file <b>630</b>. For example, if an investor has a larger WWSS coefficient, the investor receives a greater return than those with smaller WWSS coefficients according to the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>G</i>2<sub>i</sub><i>=G</i>2*WWSS<sub>i</sub>/Total (WWSS)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where G<b>2</b><sub>i </sub>is the weighted gain for an individual investor, and WWSS<sub>i </sub>is this investor's individual weighted winning stock selection coefficient. Total (WWSS) is the total of all the participating investors' weighted winning stock selection coefficients and is determined according to the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Total (WWSS)=ΣWWSS<sub>j </sub>(<i>j</i>=1, 2 , . . . , <i>N </i>for the <i>N </i>investors).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The system updates each participating investor's account at block <b>635</b> with a new balance after each trading period. The new updates are stored in block <b>640</b>. A new trading period then begins at block <b>645</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, distribution of losses may be needed if losses occur as a result of trading. In the exemplary embodiment, the loss is calculated at block <b>700</b> among these participating investors. The total loss is based on the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Total loss <i>L=L</i><sub>1</sub><i>+L</i><sub>2</sub><i>; L</i><sub>1</sub><i>=b</i><sub>1</sub><i>*L </i>and <i>L</i><sub>2</sub><i>=b</i><sub>2</sub><i>*L</i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
at block <b>705</b>, where L<sub>1 </sub>is the portion of the loss which is distributed to participating investors based on the number of shares the investor owns and is determined at block <b>710</b>. For example, if a one dollar loss per share occurs in the trading, and an investor has 100 shares, the investor realizes a one hundred dollar ($1×100) loss from the trading. The loss is distributed to inventors based on the number of individually owned shares at block <b>710</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">L<sub>2 </sub>is the portion of loss which is distributed to participating investors according to WWSS coefficients and is determined at block <b>715</b>. The WWSS coefficient may be obtained from <b>720</b>. The distribution of the loss, however, is different from the distribution of a gain. In particular, in the distribution of a loss, investors with larger WWSS coefficients share less loss, and investors with smaller WWSS coefficients share more loss because the smaller WWSS coefficients are indicative that the individual did not have past successful performance in selecting the winning stocks. L<sub>2 </sub>is distributed to each member investor according to the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>L</i><sub>2i</sub><i>=L</i><sub>2</sub>*(<i>c</i>−WWSS<sub>i</sub>)/Total (WWSS),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where WWSS<sub>i </sub>is the individual investor's weighted winning stock selection coefficient. The constant c is a control number and may be predetermined by the system. For example c may be set so that a good stock selector will lose less and a bad stock selector will lose more. The loss is distributed to the participating investors and an update to participating investors' accounts <b>730</b> is executed at block <b>725</b>. A new trading period may then begin at block <b>735</b>. The total WWSS is the summation of all the participating investors' WWSS coefficients.
