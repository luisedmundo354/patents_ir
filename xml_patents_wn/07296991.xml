<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An annular thermoplastic foam extrusion die assembly has a first die body with a first die lip and a second die body with a second die lip. The first die body includes a trench having an undercut, sloped back wall and a circumferential groove opposite the back wall. A plurality of die lip paddles are spaced apart about an annular groove, each with a tip and a heel. The tip is received for pivotal movement in the groove. The heel engages with the back wall as the heel is raised to drive the first die lip toward the second die lip to adjust a local position of the annular die gap formed therebetween. The lifting mechanism raises and lowers each of the paddles individually. The guide member guides each of the die lip paddles for positioning in a radial direction as the paddle is pivotally positioned about the annular groove.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to polymer foam sheet formation. More particularly, the present invention relates to extruder dies and die lip adjustment apparatus mechanisms for extruder dies and methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of extrusion, and more particularly, the field of thermoplastic foam extrusion, entails many techniques that are utilized in order to generate a uniform thickness product having desirable surface finish features and appropriate dimensional qualities. The ability to fine tune the dimensional qualities and surface finish on a sheet that is generated with an extruder die is a desirable feature.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one construction for an extruder die assembly that was implemented in a single commercial device as well as a single test device in the mid-1980s by the present Applicant in an attempt to improve the surface finish and dimensional qualities when forming polymer foam sheet from an extruder die.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an annular extruder die assembly <b>10</b> is shown mounted to the downstream end of an extruder <b>12</b> (similar to extruder <b>100</b> shown below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Die assembly <b>10</b> includes a barrel/spider/die assembly <b>16</b> comprising a barrel <b>18</b>, a spider <b>20</b>, and a die <b>22</b> that are joined together and mounted onto an end <b>14</b> of extruder <b>12</b>. A barrel heater spacer <b>24</b> is provided about barrel <b>18</b>. Similarly, a spider clamp ring <b>26</b> mounts spider <b>20</b> onto barrel <b>18</b>. A spider heater spacer <b>28</b> is mounted about spider <b>20</b>. A die lip clamp ring <b>30</b> mounts die <b>22</b> onto spider <b>20</b>. Additionally, a sheet metal shell <b>32</b> forms an enclosure about spacer <b>24</b>, ring <b>26</b>, spacer <b>28</b>, and ring <b>30</b>. In this manner, a cooling air passage is provided within shell <b>32</b> from a source of cooling air <b>36</b> that passes through spacer <b>24</b>, ring <b>26</b>, spacer <b>28</b>, and ring <b>30</b> where the flow of air exits adjacent an air ring <b>34</b>. Air ring <b>34</b> provides an annular flow of cooling air onto an outer surface of a tubular film of extruded foam material that is being ejected from an annular extruder die.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Spider <b>20</b> includes a spider core <b>38</b> configured to support a die shaft <b>42</b> downstream and coaxially with respect to a bore <b>40</b>. Spider core <b>38</b> is supported by a single radial arm <b>39</b> within bore <b>40</b>. Die shaft <b>42</b> mounts onto core <b>38</b> via a male threaded portion <b>44</b> that is received into a complementary female threaded portion <b>46</b> of core <b>38</b>. An outer die lip collar <b>48</b> is seated onto a cylindrical mounting post <b>50</b> of shaft <b>42</b> via a washer <b>52</b> and a jam nut <b>54</b>. Jam nut <b>54</b> is rotated (or loosened) in order to separate collar <b>48</b> from an inner die lip <b>62</b> when it is necessary to enlarge a die gap between the inner die lip <b>62</b> and an outer die lip <b>64</b> of collar <b>48</b> to clean particles from the die gap.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the prior art construction of die assembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of die lip adjuster brackets <b>56</b> are mounted in equally circumferentially spaced-apart positions about die <b>22</b> via individual threaded adjuster bolts <b>58</b>. Bolts <b>58</b> are each received into a threaded bore <b>60</b> in die <b>22</b>. Accordingly, it is necessary to machine bores <b>60</b> into die <b>22</b> (which is typically made from hardened steel) at various circumferentially spaced-apart locations thereabout. Bolt <b>58</b> is tightened into threaded engagement within bore <b>60</b> in order to drive Z-shaped bracket <b>56</b> down a frustoconically shaped slope face of die <b>22</b> which drives a finger of bracket <b>56</b> downwardly and forward into engagement along a radial surface of inner die lip <b>62</b>. Accordingly, a die gap dimension between lips <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> can be adjusted at various circumferential locations thereabout by adjusting each respective bolt <b>58</b> for each bracket <b>56</b> at each circumferential location about die <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Several problems are presented by the construction depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First; threaded bores <b>60</b> have to be machined into die <b>22</b> at various locations. Secondly, another problem is created in that brackets <b>56</b> do not apply a bending force onto inner die lip <b>62</b> at a constant radial location. The force applied from bracket <b>56</b> onto lip <b>62</b> acts on a variable fulcrum length when adjusting the die gap between lips <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. Hence, the radial repositioning of bracket <b>56</b> relative to lip <b>62</b> imparts a second variable (over the displacement of the fastener) that complicates the adjustment process and makes it more difficult to achieve a desirable and carefully controlled die gap between die lips <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> at each of the circumferential locations about die lips <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. It has been found through experience that improvements are still needed in order to increase the controllability and precision available when adjusting the tailoring of a die gap about an entire circumference of an extruder die in order to achieve improved dimensional qualities and surface finish (inner and outer) on a polymer foam sheet of material that is extruded therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Feedback from the above-described prior art effort identified the need for further improvements in order to further enhance the surface finish and dimensional qualities of a polymer foam sheet being formed by an extruder die. Accordingly, the Applicant has implemented further improvements which are described below in the Detailed Description.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An annular extruder die assembly is provided with an annular die lip adjustment apparatus and method for fine tuning dimensional qualities and surface finish on a sheet of plastic material, such as a polymer foam sheet. The die lip adjuster apparatus includes a plurality of die lip adjuster paddles that are spaced apart circumferentially within a trench in a radial outer surface of a die body. Each paddle has a tip, or toe, that pivotally seats into an annular groove of an outer die lip. The paddle is manipulated into engagement with a sloped back wall in the die body as the paddle is raised into engagement therewith and then pivoted so as to impart local bending of the die lip in order to adjust a localized die gap between the outer die lip and an inner die lip. A support ring is provided circumferentially about the die body having a plurality of complementary slots for laterally guiding and supporting each respective paddle for radial positioning pivotally about the annular groove in the outer die lip. Each paddle is adjusted in radial position via a threaded bolt that passes through the support ring and into the paddle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one aspect, an annular thermoplastic foam extrusion die assembly has an annular die, a plurality of die lip paddles, a lifting mechanism, and a guide member. The annular die has a first die body with a first die lip and a second die body with a second die lip. The second die body is positioned adjacent the first die body with the second die lip configured relative to the first die lip to form an annular groove therebetween. The first die body includes a trench having an undercut, sloped back wall. The first body has a circumferential groove opposite the back wall. The plurality of die lip paddles are spaced apart about the annular groove. Each die lip paddle has a tip and a heel. The tip is configured to be received for pivotal movement in the groove. The heel is configured to engage with the back wall as the heel is raised to drive the first die lip toward the second die lip to adjust a local position of the annular die gap formed therebetween. The lifting mechanism is configured for raising and lowering each of the, paddles individually. The guide member is configured to guide each of the die lip paddles for positioning in a radial direction as the paddle is pivotally positioned about the annular groove.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the U.S. Patent Laws “to promote the progress of science and useful arts” (Article 1, Section 8).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference will now be made to preferred embodiments of Applicant's invention comprising an annular extruder die assembly identified by reference numeral <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-14</figref>) and <b>1110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>). While the invention is described by way of preferred embodiments, it is understood that the description is not intended to limit the invention to such embodiments, but is intended to cover alternatives, equivalents, and modifications which may be broader than the embodiment, but which are included within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an effort to prevent obscuring the invention at hand, only details germane to implementing the invention will be described in great detail, with presently understood peripheral details being added to an appendix, as needed, as being presently understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a thermoplastic foam extrusion assembly typically referred to as an extruder <b>100</b> having the provision of an annular extruder die assembly <b>110</b> pursuant to the present invention. Extruder <b>100</b> is configured to produce an expandable polymer plastic, such as a thermoplastic foam extrusion, in a finished or semi-finished product. One suitable thermoplastic foam extrusion comprises a polystyrene sheet. Annular extrusion die assembly <b>110</b> generates a tube of such thermoplastic foam extrusion which is delivered over a cooling mandrel <b>102</b> where the tube is cut into an upper and lower sheet and which is then subsequently rolled onto storage rolls (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is understood that, in addition to polystyrene, other forms of thermoplastic extrusion can be generated using the annular extrusion die assembly of the present invention. For example, polyethylene (PE), PET, polypropylene, or other similar thermoplastics, including expandable or foaming polymer thermoplastics or other materials, may be generated using the annular die assembly of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">By way of example, extruder <b>100</b> is depicted as a two-stage extruder having a hopper <b>112</b> configured to receive material, particularly in the form of pellets, small beads, cubes, blocks, chunks, or flakes of material that is then melted within a melt region of a first stage <b>114</b> of extruder <b>100</b>. A second stage <b>116</b> of extruder <b>100</b> is provided downstream of first stage <b>114</b> and is configured to provide a heat extraction region for the melted material. Further details for the construction of one suitable, two-stage extruder are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,432,337, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one construction for a suitable cooling mandrel <b>102</b> that is positioned downstream of the annular extruder die assembly for stretching, sizing, and cooling a tube of extruded thermoplastic foam. Cooling mandrel <b>102</b> is also configured with a pair of knives to slit the tube of thermoplastic foam extrusion at a downstream end in order to generate a top and bottom sheet of such thermoplastic foam extrusion. Cooling mandrel <b>102</b> includes a frame <b>118</b>, a drum <b>120</b>, a collar <b>122</b> that mates with a complementary post <b>176</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) provided at a downstream end of an annular extrusion die assembly, an electrical control box <b>124</b>, a pneumatic control panel <b>126</b>, and a plurality of adjustable air vents <b>128</b> that are configured to generate a flow of cooling air on an inner surface of a tubular thermoplastic extrusion being stretched over drum <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the positioning of annular extruder die assembly <b>110</b> on the downstream end of an extruder <b>100</b>. Die assembly <b>110</b> is provided downstream of a shell <b>130</b> in which a barrel <b>132</b> and a spider <b>134</b> are provided. Spider <b>134</b> coaxially supports a die shaft <b>136</b> via a spider core <b>138</b> coaxially within a bore <b>144</b>. Spider core <b>138</b> is supported via a plurality of spider arms <b>140</b> that extend radially from core <b>138</b>. Die shaft <b>142</b> extends downstream from spider core <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Die assembly <b>110</b> provides a benefit over the prior art construction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in that a die lip adjustment apparatus <b>146</b> enhances the ability to control dimensional characteristics and surface finish in a tubular thermoplastic foam extrusion that is ejected therefrom. More particularly, an adjuster support ring <b>150</b> extends circumferentially about a die body <b>161</b> to support a plurality of die lip adjuster paddles, or wedges, <b>156</b> that are circumferentially spaced apart in equidistance and relation from each other about die body <b>161</b>. Each adjuster paddle <b>156</b> can be adjusted via a threaded adjuster bolt <b>158</b> and a washer <b>160</b> to coact against a respective ring member <b>152</b>-<b>154</b> of support ring <b>150</b> to locally deform an inner die lip <b>162</b> in relation to an outer die lip <b>164</b> of an outer die lip collar <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">By tightening fastener <b>158</b> and raising a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b>, outer die lip <b>162</b> is locally deformed towards inner die lip <b>164</b>, which reduces the die gap locally therebetween. By monitoring the thickness of a tube of thermoplastic foam extrusion being generated via a corresponding annular die gap <b>180</b>, individual paddles <b>156</b> can be adjusted at selected circumferential locations about annular die gap <b>180</b> in order to adjust die gap <b>180</b> to realize a more uniform and consistent thickness of material being generated therefrom. Paddle <b>156</b> applies lateral force to outer die lip <b>162</b> at a constant radial location which creates a constant length fulcrum arm. This leads to more controlled application of bending force onto die lip <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each die lip adjuster paddle <b>156</b> is accurately positioned in a circumferential location about die body <b>161</b> via slot <b>166</b> for guided displacement in a radial direction at a first, or heel, end and also in pivotal relation at a proximal, or tip, end (via groove <b>196</b>). A tip end of each paddle <b>156</b> is pivotally supported against die lip <b>162</b> by seating the tip end within an annular groove <b>196</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In this manner, a substantially lateral force is generated against lip <b>162</b> when paddle <b>156</b> is elevated into engagement at a rearmost end via tightening of fastener <b>158</b> into sloped back wall <b>188</b>. This action laterally biases die lip <b>162</b> towards die lip <b>164</b>, thereby decreasing the local dimension of annular die gap <b>180</b>. The provision of individual slots <b>166</b> serves to stabilize and guide the radial adjustable positioning of the rearward portion of each respective paddle <b>156</b>. Such controlled positioning, which constrains the pivotal repositioning of paddle <b>156</b> in a radial direction, allows for a more finely tailored adjustment of the annular die gap in a region locally of each paddle <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a pair of circumferential flange plates <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> are also shown. Plate <b>168</b> is moved in unison with die body <b>160</b> and outer die lip <b>162</b> as pneumatic actuators are mounted on additional mounting surfaces (not shown) that extend between plates <b>168</b> and <b>170</b>. Relative motion between plates <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> imparts relative motion between die lips <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>. One reason for imparting such relative movement is caused when it is desirable to open up the annular die gap <b>180</b> in order to clean contaminants that may have been lodged therein and delivered through an extruder within a liquid thermoplastic foam extrusion. Further details of such construction and movement are illustrated below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To facilitate the mounting of additional actuator components onto flange plates <b>168</b> and <b>170</b>, bores <b>172</b> and <b>174</b>, respectively, are circumferentially spaced thereabout for securing flange plates <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), via fasteners. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a pneumatic cylinder <b>214</b> is used to extend and retract flange plates <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> relative therebetween to open and close the die gap (or adjust total width).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Outer die lip collar <b>148</b> is axially loaded onto a die shaft <b>142</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) at a selected axial location with a cylindrical key <b>165</b>, after which cap <b>182</b> is threadingly received onto shaft <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an annular gap <b>178</b> is provided between die shaft <b>142</b> and die body <b>161</b>. Melted thermoplastic foam material is delivered through annular gap <b>178</b> where it exits via annular die gap <b>180</b> between die lips <b>162</b> and <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates in enlarged sectional view further construction details for the lip adjustment apparatus of the present invention. More particularly, die body <b>161</b> includes a trench <b>184</b> that extends circumferentially and radially inwardly into die body <b>161</b>. Trench <b>184</b> includes a circumferential relief groove <b>186</b> that forms a relief where outer die flange <b>162</b> turns radially outwardly and circumferentially thereabout. Die body <b>161</b>, opposite die lip <b>162</b>, includes a sloped back wall <b>188</b> that decreases in distance relative to die lip <b>162</b> while moving radially outwardly from trench <b>184</b> (i.e., undercut). Additionally, each die lip adjuster paddle <b>156</b> includes a sloped back face <b>190</b> that engages with back wall <b>188</b> as a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b> is raised via tightening of threaded fastener <b>158</b> against a top, or rounded circumferential cap surface, <b>206</b> of support ring <b>150</b>. Die lip adjuster paddle <b>156</b> includes a threaded bore <b>200</b> that complementarily mates in threading engagement with a threaded portion <b>202</b> on adjuster bolt <b>158</b>. Tightening of bolt <b>158</b> thereby raises a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b>, while a tip, or toe, <b>194</b> pivots within an annular groove <b>196</b> in die lip <b>162</b>. As a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b> is raised via bolt <b>158</b>, a heel <b>192</b> on paddle <b>156</b> begins to forcibly engage against sloped-back wall <b>188</b>, which drives tip <b>194</b> forcibly and axially into groove <b>196</b> which concomitantly axially biases die lip <b>162</b> into closer proximity with die lip <b>164</b>, thereby narrowing annular die gap <b>180</b> locally of paddle <b>156</b>. By adjusting each paddle <b>156</b> that is circumferentially positioned about die gap <b>180</b>, the local dimensions of annular die gap <b>180</b> can be adjusted about the entire circumference of die lips <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> in order to achieve a desired dimensional (thickness) tubular product being ejected therefrom via delivery of melted material from annular gap <b>180</b> during an extrusion of a thermoplastic film therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, paddle <b>156</b> includes a tapering finger <b>198</b> that extends from a distal end of paddle <b>156</b> toward tip <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Additionally, fastener <b>158</b> is pivotally supported atop cap <b>206</b> of ring <b>150</b> via a washer <b>160</b>. Fastener <b>158</b> passes through an oversized bore <b>204</b> that facilitates pivotal positioning of bolt <b>158</b>. This construction facilitates the pivotal raising and lowering of paddle <b>156</b> about annular groove <b>196</b> via tip <b>194</b>. Accordingly, tip <b>194</b> maintains a constant radial position within groove <b>196</b> as paddle <b>156</b> is raised and lowered, which provides for a more controlled adjustment of gap <b>180</b> between die lips <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> via tightening and loosening of bolt <b>158</b>. Additionally, a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b> is further guided for elevational support within slot <b>166</b> which prevents any lateral displacement of paddle <b>156</b> as a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b> is being raised and lowered. Such feature further improves the stability and enhances the ability to finely adjust a die gap <b>180</b> which results in a concomitant fine adjustment for product thickness and surface finish. When paddles <b>156</b> are engaged into groove <b>196</b>, ring members <b>152</b>-<b>154</b> are forced into engagement with trench <b>184</b> which supports them there along.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates paddle <b>156</b> after placement into trench <b>184</b> and tip <b>194</b> into groove <b>196</b>, but before fastener <b>158</b> is tightened to engage heel <b>192</b> into abutment with sloped-back wall <b>188</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates die lip adjuster assembly <b>146</b> after tightening bolt <b>158</b> so as to engage heel <b>192</b> against sloped-back wall <b>188</b>. Accordingly, the rear portion of paddle <b>156</b> is elevated away from trench <b>184</b>. As this happens, paddle <b>156</b> pivots about groove <b>196</b> as tip <b>194</b> is pivotally supported in groove <b>196</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates further tightening of fastener <b>158</b> so as to pivotally reposition paddle <b>156</b> further relative to groove <b>196</b> and further raise a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b>, thereby further engaging heel <b>192</b> into engagement with upper portions of sloped-back wall <b>188</b>. The further heel <b>192</b> is raised into engagement with undercut back wall <b>188</b>, the further tip <b>194</b> laterally biases die lip <b>162</b> toward die lip <b>164</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, annular die gap <b>180</b> is reduced in thickness, in a local region, relative to die gap <b>80</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>

As tip <b>194</b> is forced in a rightward direction (due to engagement of the paddle heel against the sloped-back wall of the die body), outer die lip <b>162</b> is urged towards die lip <b>164</b> so as to decrease the thickness of annular die gap <b>180</b> in the local vicinity of tip <b>194</b>. By individually adjusting each paddle around the circumference of the die lip <b>162</b>, the thickness of die gap <b>180</b> about the entire circumference can be adjusted in order to achieve a uniform thickness of extruded thermoplastic foam material.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> further illustrates the construction of lip adjuster assemblies <b>146</b> for annular extrusion die assembly <b>110</b>. The downstream portion of extruder <b>10</b> is shown partially (with additional components omitted) and in sectional view along with extruder die assembly <b>110</b> to facilitate better understanding of the construction and assembly details.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates extruder die assembly <b>110</b> positioned at the downstream end of an extruder <b>100</b> while extruding thermoplastic foam material so as to form a tube of material that is subsequently stretched, shaped, and cooled over a cooling mandrel (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). The tube of thermoplastic foam material is extruded under pressure via annular die gap <b>180</b> where the material then expands to form a tube of sheet material that is subsequently sliced on opposed lateral edges to form an upper and lower sheet that is then subsequently stored on rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a partial perspective and sectional view depicting die lip adjustment apparatus <b>146</b>. More particularly, die lip adjustment apparatus <b>146</b> includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart adjuster paddles that are guided along a rear portion for axial radial outward and inward displacement via slots <b>166</b> provided in support ring <b>150</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, tips (or fingers) <b>194</b> form arcuate paddle-shaped tips that mate in complementary engagement within an arcuate section of annular groove <b>196</b>. By tightening bolt <b>158</b>, a rear portion of paddle <b>156</b> is raised so as to engage heel <b>192</b> against sloped-back wall <b>188</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is understood that die lip adjuster paddles <b>156</b> are each formed to have an arcuate shape that substantially corresponds with the arcuate shape of the die body <b>166</b> in a similar radial position. For example, tip <b>194</b> has an arcuate contact surface that complements and corresponds with the arcuate shape of annular groove <b>196</b> in adjacent contact therewith. Likewise, the top and bottom surfaces or paddle <b>156</b> have a similar arcuate configuration that complements the shape of die body <b>166</b> at a respective radial location relative to the extruder die. For example, heel <b>192</b>, in a lateral direction, forms an arcuate contact line that complements the arcuate shape of sloped-back wall <b>188</b> that corresponds with the arcuate shape of die body <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to one construction, paddles <b>156</b> are machined from a solid block of cylindrical stock material, such as case hardened 86L20 steel. Likewise, die body <b>161</b> is also constructed from a machine and case hardened block of A2 tool steel. Similarly, outer die lip collar <b>148</b> is also constructed from a machined piece of 1018 low carbon steel with a zinc coating. Bolts <b>158</b> are Grade B socket head cap screws.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to one construction, annular die gap <b>180</b> has a typical thickness (or width) between lips <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> of 0.021 inches. Also according to one construction, annular die gap <b>180</b> is constructed to have a diameter of 5.595 inches. However, it is understood that alternative dimensions and materials can also be utilized in constructing the various components of the die lip adjuster assembly and the annular extrusion die assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14D</figref> illustrate the various sequential steps involved in placing individual die lip adjuster paddles <b>156</b> within trench <b>184</b> of die body <b>161</b>. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> illustrates the manner in which a paddle <b>156</b> is positioned into trench <b>184</b> by dropping the heel <b>192</b> downwardly into trench <b>184</b>. Subsequently, as heel <b>192</b> is cleared into trench <b>184</b>, and beneath and alongside sloped-back wall <b>188</b>, tip <b>194</b> is brought downwardly into the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>. Finally, tip <b>194</b> is brought into annular groove <b>196</b>, after which heel <b>192</b> can be raised upwardly into engagement with sloped-back wall <b>188</b> via tightening of the respective threaded fastener (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> illustrate an alternative construction annular extruder die assembly <b>1110</b> that can be substituted for assembly <b>110</b> on extruder <b>100</b> of FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>14</b>. More particularly, extruder die assembly <b>1110</b> differs from assembly <b>110</b> in that the inner die lip of assembly <b>1110</b> is moved while the outer die assembly is held stationary. In contrast, the outer die assembly of assembly <b>110</b> is moved while the inner die assembly is held stationary. Furthermore, the die lip adjustment apparatus of extruder die assembly <b>1110</b> has a modified geometry over the die lip adjustment apparatus of extruder die assembly <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, extruder die assembly <b>1110</b> has an adjustable, annular die gap <b>1180</b> that is provided downstream of a cooling air ring <b>1034</b>. Assembly <b>1110</b> is mounted onto an extruder, such as extruder <b>100</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates in greater detail provision of the die lip adjustment apparatus <b>1146</b> on extruder die assembly <b>1110</b>. A three-piece adjuster support ring <b>1150</b> is provided in a manner similar to ring <b>150</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). A plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart die lip adjuster paddles <b>1156</b> are supported about ring <b>1150</b> in a manner similar to paddles <b>156</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>). Adjuster paddles <b>1156</b> coact against a sloped rear face on die body <b>1161</b> to locally deform outer die lip <b>1162</b> toward inner die lip <b>1164</b> in response to tightening of individual threaded adjuster bolts <b>1158</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In operation, molten plastic is delivered in a downstream direction through an extruder and into a barrel <b>1132</b> where it passes into a gap provided by a spider core <b>1138</b> that is supported coaxially within a cylindrical bore <b>1144</b>. Spider core <b>1138</b> is supported coaxially within bore <b>1144</b> via a pair of spider arms <b>1140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Molten plastic is then delivered around a die shaft <b>1142</b> before exiting through an annular die gap <b>1180</b> provided between outer die lip <b>1162</b> and inner die lip <b>1164</b>. Gap <b>1180</b> is provided adjacent and downstream of cooling air ring <b>1034</b>. Individual paddles <b>1156</b> are adjusted after observing the thickness and uniformity of foam sheet product that exits gap <b>1180</b> in order to tailor the local gap dimension in order to achieve a sheet product with more uniform thickness. In the event material (or contaminants) needs to be cleaned from gap <b>1180</b>, inner die lip <b>1164</b> is moved away from outer die lip <b>1162</b> by actuating die lip collar <b>1148</b> away from outer die lip <b>1162</b>. Collar <b>1148</b> moves relative to end collar <b>1182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates in greater detail the construction and operation of die lip adjustment apparatus <b>1146</b>. Apparatus <b>1146</b> includes an adjuster support ring <b>1150</b> comprising three arcuate ring members, such as member <b>1153</b>. Ring <b>11500</b> encircles die body <b>1161</b> to guide and support a plurality of individual die lip adjuster paddles <b>1156</b> to apply local bending forces along outer die lip <b>1162</b> via annular groove <b>1196</b>. Each paddle <b>1156</b> exerts a lateral bending force on lip <b>1162</b> to locally reduce the size of gap <b>1180</b> by deforming lip <b>1162</b> toward inner die lip <b>1164</b>. Additionally, a die lip collar <b>1148</b> is moved toward lip <b>1162</b> via pneumatic fluid so as to define a nominal operating die gap <b>1180</b>. Liquid plastic material is delivered from annular gap <b>1178</b> for ejection through annular die gap <b>1180</b>. When a contaminant becomes lodged in gap <b>1180</b>, the pneumatic pressure is decreased which enables collar <b>1148</b> and lip <b>1164</b> to move away from lip <b>1162</b>, which increases the size of die gap <b>1180</b> and allows the contaminant to eject through gap <b>1180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, die body <b>116</b> has a recess that provides a sloped back wall <b>1188</b>. Each paddle <b>1156</b> is received in the recess, between the sloped back wall <b>1188</b> and annular groove <b>1196</b>, with tip, or toe, <b>1194</b> being seated within groove <b>1196</b>. Each paddle is guided for radial positioning via a slot <b>1166</b> in ring <b>1150</b>. A complementary sloped back face <b>1190</b> of paddle <b>1156</b> engages with face <b>1188</b>. Face <b>1190</b> extends upwardly from heel <b>1192</b>. A threaded bore <b>1200</b> in each paddle <b>1156</b> receives a threaded portion <b>1202</b> of a respective adjuster bolt, or fastener, <b>1158</b>. A washer <b>1160</b> is loaded onto each bolt <b>1158</b> before passing bolt <b>1158</b> through ring <b>1150</b> and into threaded portion <b>1200</b> of paddle <b>1156</b>. Washer <b>1160</b> and bolt <b>1158</b> sit atop a rounded top surface <b>1206</b> of ring of ring <b>1150</b>.</p>
