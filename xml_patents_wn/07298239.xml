<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a thermal protector suitable for protecting, against burnout, electric motors used in enclosed electric compressors, particularly, three-phase motors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional thermal protectors include a protector having three pairs of contacts as disclosed in JP-B-46-34532 and a protector having two pairs of contacts as disclosed in JP-A-1-105435 and JP-A-10-21808.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The number of movable and fixed contacts is six in the thermal protector with the three pairs of contacts, which number is non-economical. Further, the three movable contacts are secured to a metal plate serving as a heating resistor, and the metal plate is supported in its central portion by a thermally responsive plate. The central portion of the metal plate is pressed such that the three movable contacts are uniformly pressed, whereupon a stable contacting is achieved. However, the metal plate fixed by caulking or the like in a through hole provided in the central portion of the thermally responsive plate drawn into the shape of a dish. In short, the metal plate is supported on the central portion of the thermally responsive plate, on which portion stress concentrates. Accordingly, stress applied to the thermally responsive plate differs depending upon a degree at which the metal plate is caulked relative to the thermally responsive plate, whereupon the characteristic of the thermal protector tends to easily change. That is, there arises a problem that it becomes difficult to stabilize the performance of the thermal protector.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, a movable contact is secured to the thermally responsive plate itself in the thermal protector having the two pairs of contacts. Electric current is caused to flow through the thermally responsive plate so that its heat generation reverse the thermally responsive plate to open the contacts. This type of thermal protector is called direct heat type. Since the thermally responsive plate is heated up by the electric current in the thermal protector of the direct heat type, a response speed of the thermally responsive plate to an overcurrent is advantageously increased.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, since a part which generates heat is limited to the thermally responsive plate, the peripheral components is difficult to heat up. Accordingly, when the thermal protector operates such that a current path is cut off, heat generated by the thermally responsive plate is absorbed by the peripheral components whose temperatures are relatively lower, whereupon a contact opening time cannot be rendered longer. As a result, the temperature of a motor winding having been increased by the overcurrent cannot be reduced sufficiently during cutoff of current such that a temperature reached by the motor winding is inevitably rendered higher while the thermal protector repeats its reverse and return. In this case, there is a problem that the increased temperature reduces the insulating performance of an insulating coating of the motor winding thereby to cause a short circuit which leads to possible burn-out.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, when a bimetal or trimetal each with a suitable curvature and operating temperature is selected as a material for the thermally responsive plate, the specific resistance of the thermally responsive plate does not always take a suitable value. That is, there is a problem that it is difficult to design a thermal protector having both suitable values of operating current and operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The applicant invented a thermal protector which overcame the foregoing problems and filed a patent application for the invention in Japan (laid open under JP-A-2000-229795). This thermal protector is of an indirect heat type in which a thermally responsive plate is reversed by heat generation of a heating resistor. In this protector, the temperature of the thermally responsive plate is increased by heat radiation from the heating resistor when the current increases the temperature of the heating resistor. When an overcurrent or the like excessively increases the temperature of the heating resistor such that the thermally responsive plate reaches a set operating temperature, the thermally responsive plate quickly reverses thereby to cut off the current path. Not only the temperature of the thermally responsive plate but also the temperatures of peripheral components are increased by the heating resistor in the thermal protector of the indirect heat type. Accordingly, since heat is difficult to be absorbed from the thermally responsive plate to the periphery, it takes more time for the temperature of the thermally responsive plate to decrease. As a result, it takes more time for the temperature of the thermally responsive plate to decrease, whereupon the contact opening period of time can be rendered longer. Thus, since the temperature of the motor winding is sufficiently decreased during the contact opening period of time, the winding can reliably be protected against burnout. Further, the design of the thermally responsive plate can easily be carried out since the thermally responsive plate can be designed only in consideration of the reversing temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when a protector is arranged which has a large operating current exceeding 200 A, there arises a defect that a large current also flows through components on the current path other than the heating resistor. For example, a large current also flows through an elastic member supporting the heating resistor in the above-mentioned thermal protector. As a result, the elastic member itself is heated more or less. When the elastic member is repeatedly heated for a long period of time, the elastic member looses its elasticity, whereupon the contacts cannot be opened. As a countermeasure for this problem, a thickness of the elastic member is increased so that a resistance value thereof is decreased thereby to reduce an amount of heat generated. However, the thickness of the elastic member cannot be increased over the value allowing elastic deformation. This results in an upper limit of the operating current of the thermal protector, whereby a thermal protector having a large operating current cannot be arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a thermal protector which can be coped with a large operating current in the arrangement that the thermally responsive plate is revered in response to the heating of the heating resistor thereby to cut off the current path.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a thermal protector which includes a thermally responsive plate reversing when reaching a set temperature and returning when decreased below the set temperature, thereby making and breaking an electric current path, the thermal protector characterized by a casing including a housing made from a metal and having an opening, a metal plate closing the opening and having two through holes and two electrically conductive terminal pins inserted through the respective holes of the metal plate with an insulating filling member interposed therebetween, two fixed contacts fixed to ends of the conductive pins protruding into an interior of the casing respectively, a support including a main portion, a leg provided on the main portion and a support hole provided in the leg, the leg being secured to the metal plate so that the support is disposed in the casing, a heating resistor disposed between the metal plate and the main portion of the support so as to be substantially in parallel to the metal plate, the heating resistor having an end with a protrusion inserted into the support hole, the heating resistor swung about the protrusion so as to come close to and depart away from the metal plate, two movable contacts fixed to a portion of the heating resistor opposed to the fixed contacts, a coupler provided on the other end of the heating resistor for transmitting reversion and return of the thermally responsive plate to the heating resistor, and an electrically conductor electrically connecting the support and the heating resistor, and characterized in that the thermally responsive plate is disposed between the heating resistor and the main portion of the support so as to be substantially in parallel to the heating resistor, the thermally responsive plate having one of two ends fixed to the support and the other end coupled via the coupler to the heating resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above-described construction, the movable contacts are normally in contact with the fixed contacts such that two current paths are formed through the heating resistor between the metal plate and each conductive terminal pin, and further, the thermally responsive plate reverses when an overcurrent causes the thermally responsive plate to heat up and the temperature of the thermally responsive plate is increased to each a set temperature. A reversing operation of the thermally responsive plate is transferred through the coupler to the heating resistor. As a result, the heating resistor is swung such that the movable contacts are departed away from the respective fixed contacts, whereupon the current paths are cut off. With cut off of the current path, the temperature of the heating resistor is decreased such that the temperature of the thermally responsive plate is decreased to or below the set temperature, the thermally responsive plate returns. Then, the heating resistor is swung to return to its former state, whereupon the movable contacts are brought into contact with the fixed contacts respectively so that the current paths are made.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the foregoing construction, the reversing and returning operations of the thermally responsive plate are transferred through the coupler to the heating resistor. Furthermore, the elastic member used for supporting the thermally responsive plate and heating resistor are excluded from the components of the current paths. Accordingly, since the number of components generating heat upon subjection to an overcurrent is reduced other than the heating resistor, the operating current can be set to a large value. In the foregoing construction, particularly, when an electric conductor with a sufficiently small electric resistance is used, an amount of heat generated by the conductor can be restrained to a small value, whereupon the foregoing construction is further effective.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings for more detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Firstly, a first embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal section of a three-phase internal protector as a thermal protector in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are exploded perspective views of the internal protector, showing components of the internal protector. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a longitudinal section of the internal protector in its operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref> are side views of the internal protector with a housing and the heating resistor being eliminated in order that the movement of the heating resistor may be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> a cross section taken along line <b>8</b>-<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the internal protector <b>1</b> in accordance with the embodiment has a hermetic container <b>100</b> (corresponding to a casing) including a circular dome housing <b>2</b> made of a metal and a header plate <b>3</b> secured to an open end of the housing <b>2</b> by ring projection welding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The header plate <b>3</b> comprises a circular metal plate <b>4</b> having two through holes <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Electrically conductive terminal pins <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B are inserted through the holes <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B respectively and are insulated from and hermetically fixed to the header plate <b>4</b> by an electrically insulating filler <b>4</b>C. A ceramic plate <b>14</b> is attached to the upper surface of the metal plate <b>4</b> to protect the filler <b>4</b> against contact arc. Fixed contacts <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B each made from a silver alloy are secured by welding or the like to the upper end surfaces of the terminal pins <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B exposed on the upper surface of the ceramic plate <b>14</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A support <b>6</b> is provided in the hermetic container <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the support <b>6</b> has a main surface <b>6</b>A serving as a main portion, three legs <b>6</b>B, <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D extending downward from a peripheral portion of the main surface <b>6</b>A, and arm-shaped portions <b>6</b>G and <b>6</b>H provided on one side of the main surface <b>6</b>A. The main surface <b>6</b>A is provided with three slits <b>6</b>I. The central slit <b>6</b>I is formed with a screw-inserting portion <b>6</b>E. A screw <b>16</b> is inserted through the screw-inserting portion <b>6</b>E. Lower ends of the legs <b>6</b>B, <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D secured to the metal plate <b>4</b> by spot welding. The main surface <b>6</b>A is parallel with the metal plate <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A substantially circular thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is supported on the lower portion of the support <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>. The thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is supported while one end thereof is held between a central portion <b>7</b>A of a connecting piece <b>7</b> and a presser plate <b>17</b>. An end <b>7</b>B of the connecting piece <b>7</b> is secured to the underside of the main surface <b>6</b>A by the projection welding or the like so that the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is supported by the support <b>6</b>. In this case, the lower end of the screw <b>16</b> is in abutment with the central portion <b>7</b>A of the connecting piece <b>7</b>. The presser plate <b>17</b> disperses stress at the secured portion of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> thereby to prevent the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> from cracking, so that the presser plate has an effect of improving the durability of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b>. The thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is made by drawing a bimetal or trimetal into the shape of a shallow dish and reverses and returns quickly at predetermined temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A substantially circular heating resistor <b>8</b> is assembled between the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> and the header plate <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. The heating resistor <b>8</b> is made from a resisting material such as an iron-chromium alloy and has a heating portion whose area is substantially equal to an area of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b>. A protruding piece <b>8</b>A is provided on a right-hand end of the heating resistor <b>8</b> as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A notch <b>8</b>B is provided in a portion of the heating resistor <b>8</b> opposed to the protruding piece <b>8</b>A. A pair of curved protrusions <b>8</b>P and <b>8</b>Q are provided on portions of the heating protrusion <b>8</b> symmetric about the notch <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B are secured to the undersides of portions <b>8</b>C and <b>8</b>E of the heating resistor <b>8</b> opposed to the fixed contacts <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B respectively. Further, a central part of a conductor <b>11</b> is secured to the underside of portion <b>8</b>D of the heating resistor <b>8</b>. The conductor <b>11</b> has both ends <b>11</b>B and <b>11</b>C secured to the legs <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C of the support <b>6</b> respectively. The conductor <b>11</b> has a sufficiently low resistance value so as not to heat up and has elasticity so as not to prevent opening and closing operations of the heating resistor <b>8</b>. The conductor <b>11</b> comprises a stranded wire made, for example, by binding a plurality of copper wires. Further, the heating resistor <b>8</b> is designed so that resistance values of the portions between <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>D, between <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>E and between <b>8</b>D-<b>8</b>E are rendered substantially equal to one another so that amounts of heat generated by these portions become uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, T-shaped slits <b>8</b>F, <b>8</b>G and <b>8</b>H are formed in the portions between <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>E, between <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>D and between <b>8</b>D-<b>8</b>E of the heating resistor <b>8</b> respectively as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and B. The slits <b>8</b>F, <b>8</b>G and <b>8</b>H are formed in order that electrical paths of the heating resistor <b>8</b> may be narrowed to increase resistance values so that a desired amount of heat is obtained. The embodiment exemplifies a protector whose operating current is about 200 A. For example, in the case of the operating current of about 250 A, no slit is necessary since a sufficient amount of heat can be obtained without slit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is suggested to reduce the thickness of the heating resistor as a method of increasing the resistance value of the heating resistor. In this method, however, the mechanical strength of the heating resistor is reduced. Accordingly, when the heating and the opening and closing operations of the heating resistor are repeated for a long period of time, the heating resistor is deformed such that the operating current changes. In the embodiment, however, the heating resistor <b>8</b> is formed with the T-shaped slits <b>8</b>F, <b>8</b>G and <b>8</b>H in order that the electrical paths thereof may be narrowed so that the resistance value is increased. As a result, the thickness of the heating resistor <b>8</b> need not be increased and accordingly, reduction in the mechanical strength can be minimized. Further, since the heating resistor is required to efficiently transfer heat by radiation to the thermally responsive plate, an area of the heating resistor's portion opposed to the thermally responsive plate cannot be decreased to a large degree. In the embodiment, each slit is formed into the T-shape so that the resistance value can be increased while the area of the heating resistor's portion opposed to the thermally responsive plate is limited to a small value.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The leg <b>6</b>D of the support <b>6</b> has a generally rectangular through hole <b>6</b>F (corresponding to a support hole) formed in generally central portion thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> and <b>5</b>. The protruding piece <b>8</b>A is inserted into the through hole <b>6</b>F. A fixing piece <b>15</b> is secured to the distal end of the protruding piece <b>8</b>A by welding or the like, whereupon the protruding piece <b>8</b>A can be prevented from falling off from the hole <b>6</b>F. A short side of the hole <b>6</b>F is set so as to have a dimension (the width in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) larger than the thickness of the protruding piece <b>8</b>A. Further, the hole <b>6</b>F has an upper side which is formed into an arc shape. The notch <b>8</b>B is formed in the portion of the heating resistor <b>8</b> opposed to the protruding piece <b>8</b>A. A coupler <b>12</b> is fixed to the notch <b>8</b>B. The coupler <b>12</b> has a protrusion <b>12</b>A and two arm-shaped portions <b>12</b>B. The thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is inserted between the protrusion <b>12</b>A and the arm-shaped portions <b>12</b>B. The arm-shaped portions <b>12</b>B correspond to a first abutting portion in the invention, whereas the protrusion <b>12</b>A corresponds to a second abutting portion in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A gap between the protrusion <b>12</b>A and the arm-shaped portions <b>12</b>B is larger than the thickness of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b>. Thus, the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is coupled to the heating resistor <b>8</b> with a play.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is usually in abutment with the protrusion <b>12</b>A of the coupler <b>12</b> to depress the heating resistor <b>8</b> downward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As a result, contacts are closed. The protrusion <b>12</b>A is located on the central axis passing the center between the movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B and is in abutment at one portion thereof with the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b>. Thus, a pressing force of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is applied uniformly to the contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when reversing, the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> abuts the two arm-shaped portions <b>12</b>B of the coupler <b>12</b>, raising the heating resistor <b>8</b>. As a result, the contacts are opened. The two arm-shaped portions <b>12</b>B are located symmetrically about the central axis passing the center between the movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B. Accordingly, a reversing force of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is applied substantially uniformly to each arm-shaped portion <b>12</b>B. Accordingly, since the movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B are departed from the respective fixed contacts <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B without being inclined, the contact openings of the two contact pairs can be prevented from being non-uniform. Further, the curved protrusions <b>8</b>P and <b>8</b>Q abut the arm-shaped portions <b>6</b>G and <b>6</b>H of the support <b>6</b> respectively such that a predetermined contact opening is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiment, a force of the screw <b>16</b> pressing the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> via the end of the connecting piece <b>7</b> is adjusted so that a temperature at which the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> reverses is calibrated. Further, the internal protector <b>1</b> is constructed by securing the legs <b>6</b>B, <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D of the support <b>6</b> to the header plate <b>3</b> after components have been attached to the header plate <b>3</b> and the support <b>6</b> and further by securing the peripheral edge of the header plate <b>3</b> to the open end of the housing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The operation of the internal protector <b>1</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The temperature of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> is not more than an operating temperature when an electric motor to be protected is in normal operation. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the heating resistor <b>8</b> is pressed downward by the pressing force of the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b>, whereupon the movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B are in contact with the fixed contacts <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B respectively. In the contact closed state, the internal protector <b>1</b> includes current paths between the metal plate <b>4</b> and the terminal pins <b>5</b>A and <b>8</b>B, that is, current flows from the metal plate <b>4</b> through the support <b>6</b>, conductor <b>11</b>, heating resistor <b>8</b>, movable contact <b>9</b>A (<b>9</b>B) and fixed contact <b>13</b>A (<b>13</b>B) to the terminal pin <b>5</b>A (<b>5</b>B). The internal protector <b>1</b> further includes a current path between the terminal pins <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B, that is, current flows from the terminal pin <b>5</b>A through the fixed contact <b>13</b>A, movable contact <b>9</b>A, heating resistor <b>8</b>, movable contact <b>9</b>B and fixed contact <b>13</b>B to the terminal pin <b>5</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the heating resistor <b>8</b> can be inclined a slight angle since a space is defined around the protruding piece <b>8</b>A in the through hole <b>6</b>F. Accordingly, for example, even when there is a difference between the heights of the two fixed contacts <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B, the pressing force of the movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B applied to the fixed contacts <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B can be balanced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Still further, when the contacts are closed, the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> presses the heating resistor <b>8</b> downward while the movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B serve as fulcrums and the protrusion <b>12</b>A of the coupler <b>12</b> serves as an emphasis. As a result, the protruding piece <b>8</b>A of the heating resistor <b>8</b> is normally pressed against the upper side of the through hole <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Further, the upper side of the through hole <b>6</b>F is formed into an arc shape, so that the protruding piece <b>8</b>A of the heating resistor <b>8</b> is brought into point contact with the upper side of the hole <b>6</b>F at its central portion. Consequently, the heating resistor <b>8</b> tends to be further inclined.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the other hand, the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> reverse when an amount of heat generated by the heating resistor <b>8</b> is increased with the increase in electric current due to an overload operation of the motor or a locked rotor condition, or the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> reaches a predetermined operating temperature by an increase in the temperature of the motor compressor. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the heating resistor <b>8</b> is raised by the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> such that the movable contacts <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B are departed from the fixed contacts <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B respectively. As a result, all the above-mentioned current paths are opened.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the above-described construction, since the protrusion <b>12</b>A of the coupler <b>12</b> is in abutment with the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b>, a bypass current path is in the current path from the support <b>6</b> through the conductor <b>11</b> to the heating resistor <b>8</b>. The bypass current path extends from the support <b>6</b> through the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> and the coupler <b>12</b> to the heating resistor <b>8</b>. However, since the protrusion <b>12</b>A of the coupler <b>12</b> is in point contact with the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b>, a resistance value is rendered larger than the current path through the conductor <b>11</b>. Accordingly, heating due to the bypass current does not matter. In particular, when the resistance value of the heating resistor <b>8</b> needs to be set to a large value, an insulating sheet is inserted between the coupler <b>12</b> and the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> at need although a ration of the bypass current is increased. As a result, the bypass current can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention. Differences of the second embodiment from the first embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the construction of the heating resistor <b>18</b> in the case where an operating current is set to a small value of about 100 A, for example. The heating resistor <b>18</b> is further provided with slits <b>18</b>K, <b>18</b>L and <b>18</b>M in addition to the T-shaped slits <b>18</b>F, <b>18</b>G and <b>18</b>H. The current paths of the heating resistor <b>18</b> are further narrowed by the addition of the slits <b>18</b>K, <b>18</b>L and <b>18</b>M, whereupon the resistance value can be increased. As the result of such a construction, the mechanical strength and the area of the heating resistor <b>18</b> opposed to the thermally responsive plate <b>10</b> can be prevented from being decreased to a large degree while an amount of heat generated by the heating resistor <b>18</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a third embodiment of the present invention. Differences of the third embodiment from the first embodiment will be described. In the third embodiment, the heating resistor <b>28</b> is formed integrally with the coupler. More specifically, the coupler comprises an abutting portion <b>28</b>A provided on the end of the heating resistor <b>28</b> (corresponding to the first abutting portion) and a pair of arm-shaped portions <b>28</b>B (corresponding to the second abutting portion) provided on portions of the heating protrusion <b>8</b> symmetric about the abutting portion <b>28</b>A. The foregoing construction can also achieve the same effect as the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The invention should not be limited to the foregoing embodiments but may be modified as follows.</p>
