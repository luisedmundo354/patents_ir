<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to door-mounted seat belt systems and, more particularly, to a seat belt system and method that allows for more accurate determinations of weight of an object on a seat.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many vehicles have several different passenger restraint mechanisms that are operable in the event of emergency conditions. When an emergency condition is detected, retractor locks are operable to block further payout of belt webbing from the retractor spool. Pretensionsers may be operable to eliminate slack in the seat belt webbing. Airbags may be deployed both inside and outside of the vehicle to protect both passengers and pedestrians. It is important that these various restraint systems have their operation properly synchronized to provide the most effective restraint to passengers in the vehicle compartment. In some instances, it is also desirable to have the systems disabled. In particular, due to the force with which an airbag may deploy, it is usually not desirable for the airbag to be operable if a very small adult or child is in the vehicle seat associated with the airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this regard, various sensor systems have been proposed to attempt to accurately weigh the seat occupant to discern whether the occupant is in the lower 5 percentile range of weights for females such as a small child so that operation of the airbag can be disabled. One significant difficulty arises due to the downward tension forces generated by the secured seat belt about the occupant. The seat belts in active systems are usually automatically retracted on the spool of retractors with a rewind spring mechanism so that cinching of the belt about the occupant generates tension forces, particularly in the lap belt portion that tend to push the occupant downwardly into the vehicle seat. It will be appreciated that this problem is exacerbated when an auxiliary child or booster seat is placed on the vehicle seat. In this instance, the increased height of the auxiliary seat is such that cinching of the seat belt over the child and auxiliary seat adds even more downwardly directed tension force than would be present if the child were seated directly on the vehicle seat without the auxiliary seat thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several solutions have been proposed to address the tension forces generated by the secured seat belt. In some instances, these solutions provide for specific locations for the seat weight sensors (SWS) and/or utilize belt tension sensors (BTS) in the seat belt in an attempt to compensate for the seat belt tension. Other solutions also employ vision-type detector systems that attempt to determine whether a child seat is present by the detected size and distance from the sensor object is on the seat. Several propose relatively complex algorithms for interpreting the data received from the sensors. Perhaps the simplest solution has been to place both of the lower anchors in a three-point active, seat belt system, for instance, on the seat frame just above the seat weight sensors so that the downward forces generated by the secured seat belt on the seat occupant are offset by the upward forces generated at either side of the seat on the anchors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Active, door-mounted seat belt systems provide the advantage of keeping all the seat belt systems components but the buckle and its anchor out of the passenger compartment when the seat belt is not in use. In these systems, the retractor and the shoulder anchor are both mounted to the door. The lower, outboard anchor for the three-point door-mounted belt system is also mounted to the door. In many newer model vehicles, these active, door-mounted seat belt systems are highly desirable to provide more of an open cabin feel in the vehicle passenger compartment. Putting the lower, outboard anchor on the seat frame to compensate for belt tension forces on the seat occupant is not a good option as it can detract from the desired open cabin feel. More importantly, such a placement of a permanent anchor point for the belt in the passenger compartment such as on the vehicle seat frame creates a length of webbing that extends from the vehicle interior to the door even when the door is open making passenger ingress and egress from the vehicle more difficult and providing the vehicle with undesirable aesthetics. Thus, for these active, door-mounted seat belt systems, the prior art solutions focus on the use of weight and tension sensors, vision detection systems and/or complicated algorithms to determine the presence of a very small adult or child on a vehicle seat rather than creating the problems discussed above with moving the lower, door anchor to the vehicle seat frame.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for a door-mounted seat belt system that has a simple mechanism for compensating for seat belt tension. Further, the door-mounted system should not present an obstacle to passenger ingress and egress from the vehicle when the door is open.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the present invention, a system and method of compensating for seat belt tension forces are provided for a door-mounted seat belt system. In particular, the door-mounted seat belt system includes a retractor, and upper shoulder anchor, and a lower, outboard anchor that are all mounted to the vehicle door, while the buckle anchor is mounted on the inboard side of the vehicle seat frame. In one form of the present system, there is means for simulating the mounting of the door-mounted anchor to the vehicle seat. The simulating means is operable to substantially cancel out the downward directed forces generated on the vehicle seat by the seat belt secured about an object. In this manner, seat weight sensors on the vehicle seat frame are able to accurately measure the weight of an object on the seat, which weight can then be used by an electronic control system of the vehicle to enable or disable operation of an airbag associated with the seat. Herein, the term object has its normal meaning so that it can include an adult passenger or the combination of an auxiliary seat and a child that are on the vehicle seat.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred form, the simulating means is a force transfer means for transferring generally upward directed forces applied to the door-mounted anchor by the secured seat belt to the vehicle seat to substantially cancel out generally downward directed forces applied to an object on the vehicle seat by the secured seat belt. The force transfer means may be a mechanical force transfer means, and can include powered or motorized force transfer means as well.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one form, the simulating means includes cooperating arms of the vehicle seat and the lower door anchor that engage with the seat belt secured about an object on the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another form, the simulating means can be a user-operated means for allowing a user to selectively cancel out the downward directed forces applied to an object on the vehicle seat by the secured seat belt. With a primary tongue plate and buckle connected at an inboard site of the seat, the user operated means can be a secondary tongue plate and buckle for being selectively connected at an outboard side of the seat, such as would be desirable when a very small adult or child or booster seat in which a child is seated are on the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another form of the invention, a passenger restraint system is provided including a retractor mounted to the vehicle door, and a lower anchor to which seat belt webbing is secured also mounted to the vehicle door adjacent an outboard side of the seat. The seat includes at least one seat weight sensor arranged for measuring weight of an object thereon. A buckle having an anchor is mounted to an inboard side of the seat. A tongue plate is carried on the belt webbing for being latched in the buckle. A lower anchor simulator for the seat is provided that allows a connection between the seat belt webbing or the lower anchor for the webbing and the seat to be established that is operable with the seat belt webbing secured about the object on the seat with the simulator connection being separate from the latched tongue plate and buckle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The simulator connection is preferably at the outboard side of the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the lower anchor simulator includes cooperating portions of the lower anchor and the seat which are operably engaged with the seat belt secured about an object on the seat to form the simulator connection. The cooperating portions can include respective arms of a seat frame rail to which the seat weight sensor is mounted, and the lower anchor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one form, the lower anchor simulator can be a second buckle having an anchor mounted to the outboard side of the seat and a second tongue plate on the seat belt webbing with the simulator connection being the second tongue plate latched in the second buckle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The passenger restraint system is particularly useful in conjunction with an airbag that is provided for being inflated adjacent the vehicle seat in emergency conditions. The lower anchor simulator is operable to substantially cancel out downward forces of the secured seat belt about the object to allow the seat weight sensor to substantially, accurately measure weight of the object on the seat. A controller for the airbag receives the substantially accurately measured weight of the object by the seat weight sensor and based on the object weight disables or enables operation of the airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, a method of cancelling seat belt tension forces is provided including securing a door-mounted seat belt about an object on a vehicle seat, transferring upward directed forces on a door-mounted lower anchor for the seat belt to the vehicle seat, and cancelling downward directed forces generated by the secured seat belt on the object by the transferred upward directed forces.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one form, the transfer of the upward directed forces occurs automatically as an incident of securing the seat belt about the object on a seat. In another form, the upward directed forces are transferred selectively.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a vehicle <b>10</b> having a door-mounted seat belt restraint system <b>12</b> that includes one form of a lower anchor simulator <b>14</b> is depicted. The seat belt system <b>12</b> preferably has a common three-point configuration so that it includes a retractor <b>16</b> for seat belt webbing <b>18</b>, an upper shoulder anchor <b>20</b>, and a lower anchor <b>22</b>. The webbing <b>18</b> carries a sliding latch or tongue plate <b>24</b>. Other seat belt system configurations could also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To provide the passenger compartment <b>26</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b> with more of an open feel, it is desirable to minimize the number of components of the seat belt system <b>12</b> that are located in the passenger compartment <b>26</b>, such as mounted to the vehicle seats, floor or up along the pillars upstanding therefrom. To this end, the retractor <b>16</b>, shoulder anchor <b>20</b>, and lower anchor <b>22</b> are all preferably mounted to the vehicle door <b>28</b>. The illustrated vehicle <b>10</b> is similar to an SUV except that it has more of a box shape passenger compartment <b>26</b> such as in Honda Element vehicles. In this configuration, the seat belt system <b>12</b> for the front passenger seat <b>30</b> is mounted along the forward, vertical edge of the rear door <b>28</b> on the interior side thereof so that the tongue plate <b>24</b> is readily accessible to the passenger occupants seated on the passenger seat <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, it is desirable to avoid having the webbing <b>18</b> from the door-mounted seat belt system <b>12</b> extending between the open door <b>28</b> and the passenger compartment <b>26</b> when the seat belt webbing <b>18</b> is not secured about a seat occupant. This is particularly true when the occupant is other than a small child in an auxiliary seat as otherwise such a span of webbing between the door <b>28</b> and the passenger compartment <b>26</b> can present an obstacle for ingress and egress into and out from passenger compartment <b>26</b>. The present lower anchor simulator <b>14</b> avoids a permanently fixed anchor point for the seat belt webbing <b>18</b> in the passenger compartment <b>26</b>. Instead, only anchor <b>31</b> provided for the buckle <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>) is in the vehicle compartment <b>26</b> on vehicle seat <b>30</b> and forms a releasable anchor point for the webbing <b>18</b>. At the same time, the simulator <b>14</b> is able to transfer the upwardly directed forces thereon to the seat frame <b>34</b> with the tongue plate <b>24</b> latched in the buckle <b>32</b> about an occupant on the seat <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this manner, the simulator <b>14</b> allows for accurate weight measurement of an object on the seat <b>30</b>, as will be described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present passenger restraint system <b>12</b> employs at least one seat weight sensor, and preferably multiple sensors <b>36</b> at various locations about the frame <b>34</b> of the seat <b>30</b>. Usually, there will be seat weight sensors <b>36</b> on either side rail <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> of the seat frame <b>34</b>. The seat weight sensors <b>36</b> can be strain gauges, although any known weight sensor can be employed. Generally, four strain gauges <b>36</b> will be utilized such as one at each end of the seat frame rails <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> will their readings summed to provide the weight of the object on the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As has previously been discussed, when there is an occupant on the seat and the seat belt <b>18</b> is secured about the occupant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the tension forces of the secured seat belt <b>18</b> can cause erroneous weight readings to be generated by the sensors <b>36</b>, which are then transmitted to the airbag controller <b>43</b>. Where the occupant is an adult, this is not a serious problem as typically this added weight will not affect the determination by controller <b>43</b> of whether an airbag <b>45</b> is to be deployed. However, in the situation where there is an auxiliary seat such as a child or booster seat <b>44</b> supported on the seat <b>30</b> for use with a infant or a small child, this extra force generated by the tension in the secured seat belt <b>18</b> needs to be accounted to ensure that the controller <b>43</b> properly disables the airbag <b>45</b>. This is also true where the adult is unusually small, such as a lower 5 percentile weight female. Rather than mounting both the lower anchor <b>22</b> and the buckle anchor <b>31</b> to the respective outboard and inboard seat frame rails <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> to achieve force cancellation as previously discussed, the outboard anchor <b>22</b> is mounted to the door <b>28</b> and the lower anchor simulator <b>14</b> is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, the simulator <b>14</b> includes portions <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> of the lower anchor <b>22</b> for the seat belt <b>18</b> and the seat <b>30</b>, and more specifically the outboard rail <b>40</b> thereof As shown, these portions <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> can take the form of arms <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively, that extend toward each other and overlap so that they can engage one another when the seat belt webbing <b>18</b> is secured about an object on the seat <b>30</b>. In this regard, the arms <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> form a mechanical linkage between the anchor <b>22</b> and the seat <b>30</b> with the seat belt <b>18</b> secured about an object on the seat <b>30</b>. For this purpose, the lower anchor <b>22</b> preferably includes a pivot mount <b>54</b> for pivotably mounting anchor member <b>56</b> to the door <b>28</b>, and specifically to a rigid body member <b>59</b> thereof, while the arm <b>52</b> is rigidly fixed to the rail <b>40</b>. The pivot mount <b>54</b> can include a pivot shaft <b>55</b> about which the anchor member <b>56</b> can pivot. Further, to allow for slight inboard and outboard shifting of the anchor member <b>56</b>, resilient member <b>60</b> can be mounted between the anchor member <b>56</b> and door member <b>59</b>. The resilient member can be in the form of a spring or thrust washer <b>60</b> that is mounted about the pivot shaft <b>55</b> which allows for inboard and outboard flexing of the anchor member <b>56</b> as the belt <b>18</b> is secured about an object on the seat <b>30</b> and the secured belt <b>18</b> is loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The anchor member <b>56</b> has a belt webbing slot <b>58</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the slot <b>58</b> is formed toward the forward end of the anchor member <b>56</b> adjacent the transversely extending arm <b>50</b> opposite the pivot mount <b>54</b> at the rear end of the anchor member <b>56</b>. The webbing <b>18</b> extends through the slot <b>58</b> and is folded back on itself and sewn thereto so that the webbing <b>18</b> is substantially permanently fixed to the anchor member <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Prior to latching of the tongue plate <b>24</b> in the buckle <b>32</b>, the anchor arm <b>50</b> is in clearance below the seat arm <b>52</b> with the vehicle door <b>28</b> closed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, so that the arms <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> do not interfere with closing of the vehicle door <b>28</b> via engagement with one another. However, closing of the door <b>28</b> brings the arm <b>50</b> into alignment with the arm <b>52</b> therebelow, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When the tongue plate <b>24</b> is latched into the buckle <b>32</b> to secure the webbing <b>18</b> about the occupant or auxiliary seat <b>44</b>, the upwardly directed forces on the lower anchor <b>22</b> will cause the anchor member <b>56</b> to shift upwardly as by pivoting about the mount <b>54</b>. This brings the anchor arm <b>50</b> into engagement with the rigid anchor arm <b>52</b> extending transversely from the outboard seat rail <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this manner, the upwardly directed forces applied to the lower anchor <b>22</b> by the secured seat belt <b>18</b> are mechanically transferred to the seat frame <b>34</b>, and particularly the outboard rail <b>40</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The rail arm <b>52</b> is shown as being formed integrally with a mounting bracket <b>61</b> that is fixed to the outboard rail <b>40</b>. The bracket <b>61</b> is attached to the rail <b>40</b> at a location above the seat weight sensor <b>36</b>. Likewise, the buckle anchor <b>31</b> is disposed above the corresponding seat weight sensor <b>36</b> associated with the inboard seat frame rail <b>42</b>. In this manner, the downwardly directed forces applied by the tensioned seat belt webbing <b>18</b> on the occupant or child seat <b>44</b> are substantially cancelled out by the upwardly directed forces on the buckle anchor <b>31</b> and the lower anchor <b>22</b> at the seat weight sensors <b>36</b> associated with each of the seat frame rails <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. As is apparent, operation of the simulator <b>14</b> requires no intervention by the user or vehicle occupant beyond the latching of the tongue plate <b>24</b> in the buckle <b>32</b> as with normal use of the door-mounted seat belt system <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning to more of the details, a guide device <b>62</b> can be provided so that lower anchor <b>22</b> is guided in its shifting up and down as the seat belt <b>18</b> is buckled and unbuckled with an occupant in the seat. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the guide device <b>62</b> can include a vertically-extending slot <b>64</b> in the door member <b>59</b>. The device <b>62</b> further includes a bent tab <b>65</b> that extends at right angles from the anchor member <b>56</b> toward the door member <b>59</b> and into the slot <b>64</b> thereof. As illustrated, the tab <b>65</b> is formed adjacent the forward end of the anchor member <b>56</b> just above the anchor arm <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an alternate form of an anchor simulator <b>66</b> is illustrated. In the belt tension force compensating system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is a door-mounted seat belt system <b>68</b> similar to the system <b>12</b> but for the differences in the respective simulators <b>14</b> and <b>66</b>. In this regard, the seat belt system <b>68</b> includes a retractor <b>70</b> in which a spool of seat belt webbing <b>72</b> is wound. The webbing <b>72</b> extends up from the retractor <b>70</b> through a shoulder anchor <b>74</b> in the form of a guide loop. The webbing <b>72</b> is redirected by the guide loop and extends down to a fixed, lower anchor <b>76</b>. As shown, each of the retractor <b>70</b>, shoulder anchor <b>74</b> and lower anchor <b>76</b> are rigidly mounted to the vehicle door <b>28</b> similar to corresponding components of the seat belt system <b>12</b>. In addition, the buckle anchor <b>31</b> and upwardly projecting buckle <b>32</b> are mounted to the inboard side of the vehicle seat <b>30</b> at the inboard rail <b>42</b> as in seat belt system <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the system <b>68</b>, in addition to a primary tongue plate <b>78</b> that is slidably carried on the belt webbing <b>72</b> between the shoulder anchor <b>74</b> and lower anchor <b>76</b> for being releasably latched into the buckle <b>32</b>, there is a secondary tongue plate <b>80</b> of the simulator <b>66</b>. The simulator tongue plate <b>80</b> can be attached to the belt webbing <b>72</b> by a separate belt member <b>81</b> sewn to lap belt portion <b>85</b>. A buckle <b>82</b> is anchored to the outboard seat frame rail <b>40</b> at <b>83</b> and is adapted to releasably receive the secondary tongue plate <b>80</b> latched therein. The spacing between the tongue plate <b>78</b> as provided by a stop <b>84</b> on the belt webbing <b>72</b> and the tongue plate <b>80</b> along the lap belt portion <b>85</b> and including the belt member <b>81</b> is such that when both are latched in their respective buckles <b>32</b> and <b>82</b>, there will be slack generated in the belt webbing portion <b>86</b> extending between the lower anchors <b>76</b> and <b>83</b> with the lap belt portion <b>85</b> otherwise tautly extending about the occupant's lap, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. In this manner, the upwardly directed loading <b>76</b> normally applied to the door-mounted, lower anchor <b>76</b> is instead transferred and applied to the lower buckle anchor <b>83</b>. Thus, the lower anchor simulator <b>66</b> includes cooperating portions of the belt webbing <b>72</b> and seat <b>30</b>, and specifically seat frame rail <b>40</b> thereof, in the form of the secondary tongue plate <b>80</b> attached to the webbing <b>72</b> and the buckle <b>82</b> anchored to the rail <b>40</b>, which form a mechanical linkage therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The operation of the lower anchor simulator <b>66</b> necessitates additional user intervention beyond that of buckling the tongue plate <b>78</b> in the inboard buckle <b>32</b> as it also requires the secondary tongue plate <b>80</b> to be latched into the outboard buckle <b>82</b>. Thus, in contrast to the lower anchor simulator <b>14</b> that operates to cancel out seat belt tension forces automatically upon securing the seat belt <b>18</b> about an object on the seat <b>30</b>, the lower-anchor simulator <b>66</b> requires that a user also latch the tongue plate <b>80</b> into the buckle <b>82</b> so that cancellation of tension forces can occur for accurate weight readings of the object by the seat weight sensors <b>36</b>. In this regard, it should be noted that for typical vehicle occupants that do not need to employ a child or booster seat <b>44</b> based on their size, it will be desirable for operation of the airbag associated with the seat <b>30</b> to be enabled. For example, an adult occupant can use the seat belt system <b>68</b> in its typical configuration by only latching the tongue plate <b>78</b> in the buckle <b>32</b>. Any extra downward force generated by the tension in the seat belt webbing <b>72</b> secured about the occupant will have no consequence with respect to airbag operation, as the airbag will be enabled even with the appropriate reading of the adult occupants weight such as could occur if they were to latch the secondary tongue plate <b>80</b> in the buckle <b>82</b>. Accordingly, latching the tongue plate <b>80</b> in the buckle <b>82</b> is optional for adult seat occupants.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the other hand, when a child or booster seat <b>44</b> is placed on the seat <b>30</b>, it will be necessary for the user or occupant to latch both the tongue plate <b>78</b> and the tongue plate <b>80</b> in their respective buckles <b>32</b> and <b>82</b> so that a proper weight reading can be obtained via the sensors <b>36</b>. To this end, the simulator tongue plate <b>80</b> and buckle <b>82</b> can be identified for use with such an auxiliary seat <b>44</b> as by indicia thereon to alert the user, who typically will be an adult buckling in children in the auxiliary seat <b>44</b> on the seat <b>30</b>, that the tongue plate <b>80</b> should be latched into the buckle <b>82</b>. Very small adults, e.g. in the lower 5 percentile range of adult female weights, can also be advised to buckle the tongue plate <b>80</b> in the buckle <b>82</b>. However, because of this extra intervention, it will be appreciated that the lower anchor simulator <b>14</b> is more preferred than the lower anchor simulator <b>66</b>. Nevertheless, it can be seen that both simulators <b>14</b> and <b>66</b> avoid the need to have a permanent connection between their corresponding vehicle seat simulator portions <b>48</b> and <b>82</b> and the seat belt webbing <b>18</b> and <b>72</b>, respectively, as would be present if the lower, outboard seat belt anchor were moved off the vehicle door to the adjacent, outboard seat frame rail <b>40</b> for seat belt tension cancellation purposes. Accordingly, the simulator <b>14</b> only requires that the occupant unlatch the tongue plate <b>24</b> from the buckle <b>32</b> to avoid having a length of webbing <b>18</b> extending between the door <b>28</b> and passenger compartment <b>26</b>, and particularly the seat <b>30</b> therein. Similarly, the simulator <b>66</b> only requires that in addition to unlatching the tongue plate <b>78</b> from the buckle <b>32</b>, that the tongue plate <b>80</b> be unlatched from the buckle <b>82</b> as well so as to avoid having a length of belt webbing <b>72</b> extending between the vehicle door <b>28</b> and vehicle seat <b>30</b>. This is of particular value when the door <b>28</b> is open so that the passengers have substantially unobstructed ingress and egress from the vehicle passenger compartment <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To summarize the method of operation of the tension compensating systems described herein including the respective lower anchor simulators <b>14</b> and <b>66</b> thereof and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the door-mounted seat belts are first secured about an object on the vehicle seat. Next, the upward directed forces on the lower, outboard anchor of the seat belt system are transferred to the seat frame, and specifically the adjacent outboard rail thereof, either automatically as an incident of latching the inboard tongue plate and buckle as with lower anchor simulator <b>14</b>, or selectively as with the simulator <b>66</b> by the required latching of the outboard tongue plate and buckle. This force transfer is operable to cancel the seat belt tension forces pushing the object downward into the seat at the outboard side thereof. Thereafter, with the downward seat belt forces cancelled, the seat weight sensors are operable to accurately read the weight of the object on the seat with the airbag either enabled or disabled based on this accurate weight reading. While the means for simulating the mounting of the door mounted, lower anchor to the vehicle seat take advantage of exclusively mechanical force transfer means via the lower anchor simulators <b>14</b> and <b>66</b> described herein, it is also anticipated that powered or motorized mechanisms could also be employed to transfer the upwardly directed forces on the door-mounted lower anchor to the vehicle seat <b>30</b>, and particularly the outboard, seat frame rail <b>40</b> thereof adjacent the vehicle door <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While there have been illustrated and described particular embodiments of the present invention, it will be appreciated that numerous changes and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art, and it is intended in the appended claims to cover all those changes and modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
