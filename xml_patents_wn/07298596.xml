<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A magneto-resistance effect head is provided with a lower conductive layer which is provided with a recessed portion, and a vertical bias layer is provided in the recessed portion. A free layer is provided on the lower conductive layer. On the free layer, layered in the following order are the non-magnetic layer, the fixed layer, the fixing layer, and the upper layer so as not to be placed immediately above the vertical bias layer. The non-magnetic layer, the fixed layer, the fixing layer, and the upper layer are buried in an insulation layer. Furthermore, an upper conductive layer is provided on the upper layer and the insulation layer. In the direction of the magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer, the free layer is made greater in length than the fixed layer and the free layer is disposed in proximity to the vertical bias layer with the distance between the fixed layer and the vertical bias layer remaining unchanged.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a magneto-resistance effect element for writing and reading an information signal on magnetic storage media, a magneto-resistance effect head comprising the magneto-resistance effect element, a magneto-resistance transducer system comprising the magneto-resistance effect head, and a magnetic storage system comprising the magneto-resistance transducer system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a magneto-resistance effect element that reduces noise in a read signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally disclosed is a magnetic read transducer that is referred to as a magneto-resistance sensor (hereinafter densities. The MR sensor allows the read element to vary the electrical resistance as the function of the strength and the orientation of a magnetic flux applied from the outside in order to measure a variation in electrical resistance, thereby detecting a magnetic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a conventional MR sensor operates based on the anisotropic magneto-resistance effect (hereinafter referred to as an AMR effect). By this effect, the component of a change in electrical resistance of the read element varies in proportion to the second power of the cosine of the angle between the orientation of magnetization and the direction of the sense current flowing through the read element. The AMR effect is described in more detail in an article entitled “Memory, Storage, and Related Applications”, D. A. Thompson, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Vol. MAG-11, No. 4, pp. 1039 (1975).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, disclosed lately is a more prominent magneto-resistance effect by which a change in electrical resistance of the layered magnetic sensor is caused by spin-dependent transportation of conduction electrons between magnetic layers via a non-magnetic layer and spin-dependent scattering associated therewith at layer boundaries. This magneto-resistance effect is identified by various names such as the “giant magneto-resistance effect” or the “spin valve effect”. Such a magneto-resistance sensor is formed of suitable materials to provide improved detection sensitivity and greater changes in electrical resistance in comparison with a sensor which makes use of the AMR effect. In a MR sensor of this type, in-plane resistance between a pair of ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer varies in proportion to the cosine of the angle between the orientations of magnetization of the aforementioned pair of ferromagnetic layers. In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 2-61572 submitted in July 1988, for claiming priority, described is a layered magnetic structure for providing a significant change in MR caused by an anti-parallel alignment of the orientations of magnetization in the magnetic layers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, such a phenomenon has been recently discovered in which a relative change in orientation of magnetization of ferromagnetic bodies disposed above and below a very thin insulation layer (barrier layer) through which a tunneling current flows, causes a change in electrical resistance. And, the layered structure made up of the ferromagnetic layer, the barrier layer, and the ferromagnetic layer is termed a ferromagnetic tunnel junction. For example, ferromagnetic tunnel junctions are introduced in “Journal of Applied Physics”, Vol. 79 (8), No. 15, pp. 4724 (1996).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, in a shield type element that makes use of a ferromagnetic tunnel junction, it is necessary to conduct a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the element in perpendicular relation to the tunnel junction. However, the structure similar to the shield type element employing the conventional spin valve presents a problem that the sense current flows through a vertical bias layer for controlling the magnetic domain of the free layer disposed near the tunnel junction to reduce the current flowing through the tunnel junction, thereby providing a reduced change in electrical resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to overcome this problem, a read head was disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-162327 submitted on Nov. 27, 1996, for claiming priority. The read head, employing a ferromagnetic tunnel junction film, has a structure in which the vertical bias layer is not in contact with the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a fragmentary sectional view illustrating the prior-art ferromagnetic tunnel head described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-162327. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the structure of a patterned ferromagnetic tunnel junction element, or a magneto-resistance effect element <b>30</b>, having an insulation layer <b>11</b> disposed between a vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>and a free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>. This structure can prevent a sense current from flowing through the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, since the insulation layer <b>11</b> disposed between the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>acts also as a magnetic separation layer, it is difficult in the magneto-resistance effect element <b>30</b> to apply a vertical bias magnetic field of a sufficient magnitude to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>. This presents such a problem that the magnetic domain of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>is controlled insufficiently to cause the hysteresis of the R-H loop to increase for the shield type sensor, thereby providing a high-noise-level read signal upon reading magnetic information on a storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to overcome this problem, a read head was disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-255231 submitted on Mar. 7, 1997, 1996, for claiming priority.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is an object of the present invention to provide a magneto-resistance effect element, a magneto-resistance effect head, a magneto-resistance transducer system, and a magnetic storage system, which can prevent the sense current from flowing into the vertical bias layer, provide a read signal of a low noise level, and a good (S/N) ratio and bit error rate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer and a free layer provided on the lower conductive layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field applied thereto. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a non-magnetic layer provided on top of the free layer, a fixed layer provided on the non-magnetic layer and having a pinned orientation of magnetization, and a vertical bias layer, provided on the lower conductive layer, for applying a magnetic field to the free layer. The magneto-resistance effect element is adapted that the free layer is greater in length in the direction of a magnetic field applied thereto by the vertical bias layer than the fixed layer, and a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the non-magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present invention, the free layer is made greater in length than the fixed layer in the direction of magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer, thereby allowing only the free layer to be disposed near the vertical bias layer. This allows the vertical bias layer to effectively apply a vertical bias magnetic field to the free layer and makes it possible to prevent the leakage of a sense current from the fixed layer to the vertical bias layer. This allows almost all the sense current, which is applied to the magneto-resistance effect element to detect a change in electrical resistance, to flow through the non-magnetic layer, thereby making it possible to reduce noise in the read signal waveform and improve the (S/N) ratio and bit error rate. Incidentally, that the sense current flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the aforementioned non-magnetic layer means that the sense current flows in orthogonal relation thereto to such an extent as to measure a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer without any trouble. In addition, the direction of the magnetic field applied by the aforementioned vertical bias layer agrees with the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the aforementioned sense current flows on a plane parallel to an air bearing surface of the magneto-resistance effect head.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, it is preferable that the lower conductive layer has a recessed portion, and at least part of the vertical bias layer is buried in the recessed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">This makes it possible to place the vertical bias layer and the free layer to be flush with each other, and allows the vertical bias layer to apply a vertical bias magnetic field smoothly and effectively to the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, at least part of the free layer can be brought into direct contact with the vertical bias layer. Alternatively, the underlying layer for free layer may be provided below the free layer such that the underlying layer for free layer is brought into contact with the vertical bias layer. A vertical bias layer protective layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer such that the vertical bias layer protective layer is brought into contact with the free layer or the underlying layer for free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">This allows the vertical bias layer to apply a vertical bias magnetic field more positively and effectively to the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer, a magnetic layer provided on the lower conductive layer, and a free layer provided on the magnetic layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field coupled magnetically to the magnetic layer and applied thereto. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a non-magnetic layer provided on the free layer, a fixed layer provided on the non-magnetic layer and having a pinned orientation of magnetization, and a vertical bias layer, provided on the lower conductive layer, for applying a magnetic field to the free layer. The magneto-resistance effect element is adapted that the magnetic layer is greater in length in the direction of a magnetic field applied thereto by the vertical bias layer than the free layer, and a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic body flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the non-magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, the magnetic layer can be magnetically coupled to the free layer by anti-ferromagnetic coupling or ferromagnetic coupling. Furthermore, a second non-magnetic layer may be provided between the magnetic layer and the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the present invention, a vertical bias magnetic field is once applied to the magnetic layer from the vertical bias layer, and then the vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer from the magnetic layer. The vertical bias magnetic field is thus applied to the free layer through the two steps, thereby facilitating the control of the vertical bias magnetic field applied to the free layer. In addition, in the direction of the magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer, the free layer is made greater in length than the free layer, thereby placing only the magnetic layer near the vertical bias layer. This allows the vertical bias layer to effectively apply the vertical bias magnetic field to the magnetic layer and makes it possible to prevent the leakage of sense current from the layered body to the vertical bias layer, thereby allowing almost all sense current to conduct through the non-magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, at least part of the magnetic layer can be brought into direct contact with the vertical bias layer. Alternatively, the underlying layer for magnetic layer may be provided below the magnetic layer such that the underlying layer for magnetic layer is brought into contact with the vertical bias layer. A vertical bias layer protective layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer such that the vertical bias layer protective layer is brought into contact with the magnetic layer or the underlying layer for magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This allows the vertical bias layer to apply a vertical bias magnetic field more positively and effectively to the magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer, a fixed layer provided on the lower conductive layer and having a pined orientation of magnetization, and a non-magnetic layer provided on the fixed layer. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a free layer provided on the non-magnetic layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field applied thereto, a magnetic layer provided on the free layer and magnetically coupled to the free layer, and a vertical bias layer for applying a magnetic field to the magnetic layer. The magneto-resistance effect element is adapted that a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the non-magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, a fixing layer for pinning the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer may be provided below the fixed layer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, it is preferable that at least part of the magnetic layer is brought into direct contact with the vertical bias layer.

A vertical bias layer protective layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer such that the vertical bias layer protective layer is brought into contact with the magnetic layer or the underlying layer for magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, the magnetic layer can be magnetically coupled to the free layer by anti-ferromagnetic coupling or ferromagnetic coupling. Furthermore, the second non-magnetic layer may be provided between the magnetic layer and the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer, a fixed layer provided on the lower conductive layer and having a pinned orientation of magnetization, and a first non-magnetic layer provided on the fixed layer. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a free layer provided on the first non-magnetic layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field applied thereto. The magneto-resistance effect element further comprises a first magnetic layer provided on the free layer and magnetically coupled to the free layer, a second magnetic layer provided on the first magnetic layer and magnetically coupled to the first magnetic layer, and a vertical bias layer for applying a magnetic field to the first and second magnetic layers. The magneto-resistance effect element is adapted that a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the first non-magnetic layer flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the first non-magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition, the first magnetic layer and the second magnetic layer are equal to or greater than the free layer in length in the direction of the magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, a second non-magnetic layer can be provided between the free layer and the first magnetic layer, while a third non-magnetic layer can be provided between the first magnetic layer and the second magnetic layer. In addition, an underlying layer for fixing layer may be provided under the fixing layer.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present invention, a vertical bias magnetic field can be once applied to a three-layered film made up of the first magnetic layer, the third non-magnetic layer, and the second magnetic layer, from the vertical bias layer and then to the free layer from the three-layered film. As described above, the vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer from the vertical bias layer through two steps, thereby facilitating the control of the vertical bias magnetic field applied to the free layer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still furthermore, the product of saturation magnetization and film thickness of the first magnetic layer can be substantially equal to the product of saturation magnetization and film thickness of the second magnetic layer, and the three-layered film made up of the first magnetic layer, the third non-magnetic layer, and the second magnetic layer can be a layered antiferromagnetic body.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">This eliminates the sensitivity of the three-layered film to magnetic fields but provides only the free layer with the sensitivity to magnetic fields. For this reason, when the magneto-resistance effect element is incorporated into a read head, the read track width is determined only by the width of the free layer, thus making it possible to prevent the broadening of the effective track width. Incidentally, “being substantially equal” means “being equal to such an extent that an effect of reduction in sensitivity of the three-layered film to magnetic fields can be recognized”.</p>

Incidentally, all the fragmentary sectional views employed in the embodiments of the present invention illustrate a magneto-resistance effect head cut in parallel to the surface of an air bearing. In addition, in the embodiments of the present invention, the expression of “patterning” of layers or the like denotes allowing part of the layers or the like to remain and part thereof to be removed by etching or like means in illustrated regions within illustrated sections. Thus, this expression will never mean allowing part of the layers or the like to remain and part thereof to be removed by etching or like means in non-illustrated sections or regions. In other words, in the embodiments of the present invention, the layers or the like that are not denoted with the expression of “patterning” may also allow part thereof to remain and part thereof to be removed by etching or like means in non-illustrated sections or regions.</p>

In particular, three-layer films such as Co/Ru/Co, CoFe/Ru/CoFe, CoFeNi/Ru/CoFeNi, Co/Cr/Co. CoFe/Cr/CoFe, and CoFeNi/Cr/CoFeNi are favorable.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Then, non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> is disposed between the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the fixed layer <b>5</b>, varying in electrical resistance in accordance with the angle between the orientation of magnetization of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>and that of the fixed layer <b>5</b>.

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition, the upper layer <b>7</b> is to prevent the layer disposed thereunder from being corroded during the processes for fabricating the magneto-resistance effect head <b>61</b><i>a </i>and in the service environment.

In particular, Ta, Zr, and Ti are favorable.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Furthermore, the insulation layer <b>11</b> is to prevent the leakage of a sense current flowing through the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>. Materials forming the insulation layer <b>11</b> include a single material, a mixture of materials, and a multi-layered film formed of materials, which are selected from the group consisting of Al oxide, Si oxide, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, and diamond-like carbon.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Still furthermore, materials forming the lower shield layer <b>16</b> and the upper shield layer <b>17</b> include a single material of one type, a mixture of materials of two or more types, or a multi-layered film formed of materials of two or more types, which are selected from the group consisting of NiFe, CoZr, CoFeB, CoZrMo, CoZrNb, CoZrTa, CoHf, CoTa, CoTaHf, CoNbHf, CoZrNb, CoHfPd, CoTaZrNb, CoZrMoNi, FeAlSi, a Fe nitride base material, MnZn ferrite, NiZn ferrite, and MgZn ferrite.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Now, the operation of the magneto-resistance effect head <b>61</b><i>a </i>is explained below. When an external magnetic field is applied to the magneto-resistance effect head <b>61</b><i>a</i>, a magnetic field is applied to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>via the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>, causing the orientation of magnetization of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>to change in accordance with the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field applied thereto. And, since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer <b>5</b> is pinned by the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer <b>5</b> and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>. In this state, the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> and the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Now, an effect of this embodiment is described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the magneto-resistance effect head <b>61</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment has the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>which is greater than the fixed layer <b>5</b> in length, and only the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>is disposed near the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. This allows the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>to apply a magnetic field positively and effectively to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>and makes it possible to prevent the leakage of a sense current from the fixed layer <b>5</b> to the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. This allows almost all the sense current applied to flow through the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, thereby improving the performance of the magneto-resistance effect head <b>61</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Furthermore, part of the direction of thickness of the patterned underlying layer for vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>is buried in the recessed portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the lower conductive layer <b>1</b>. This provides a gradual slope to the end portion of the underlying layer for vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>, thereby allowing the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>to apply a vertical bias magnetic field to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> are fragmentary sectional views illustrating a variation of the magneto-resistance effect element according to this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a magneto-resistance effect element <b>31</b><i>b </i>having the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>patterned to bring the end portion thereof into contact with that of the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a magneto-resistance effect element <b>31</b><i>c </i>having the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>patterned to make the end portion thereof overlap that of the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. Like the magneto-resistance effect element <b>31</b><i>a</i>, the magneto-resistance effect element <b>31</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b> can constitute the magneto-resistance effect head.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Incidentally, this embodiment has shown that the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> is patterned in conjunction with the fixed layer <b>5</b>, the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, and the upper layer <b>7</b>. However, the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> can be extended like the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> may be patterned to be larger than the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b </i>and smaller than the free layer <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, the underlying layer for vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>a</i>, the underlying layer for free layer <b>3</b><i>a</i>, and the upper layer <b>7</b> may be omitted, and a protective layer for protecting the vertical bias layer may be provided on top of the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Furthermore, this embodiment has shown that the lower shield layer <b>16</b> and the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> are provided separately. However, the lower shield layer <b>16</b> and lower conductive layer <b>1</b> may be a common layer. In this case, the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> is omitted. In addition, the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> and the upper shield <b>17</b> may be a common layer. In this case, the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> is omitted. This allows the gap between the top and bottom shield layers to be made smaller. Furthermore, an upper gap layer may be provided between the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> and the shield layer <b>17</b> or a lower gap layer may be provided between the lower shield layer <b>16</b> and the lower conductive layer <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the aforementioned structure, the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>is to transmit a vertical bias magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, antiferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. In addition, the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> allows the component material and the film thickness thereof to control the magnetic coupling between the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The underlying layer for magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>a </i>is to improve film quality such as the crystallization properties of the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>and provide good magnetic properties for the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b</i>. Incidentally, the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> is an insulation layer for conducting a tunneling current therethrough, whereas the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> is an electrically conductive layer for controlling the magnetic coupling between the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">As materials forming the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b</i>, employed are alloys such as NiFe, Co, CoFe, NiFeCo, FeCo, CoFeB, CoZrMo, CoZrNb, CoZr, CoZrTa, CoHf, CoTa, CoTaHf, CoNbHf, CoZrNb, CoHfPd, CoTaZrNb, and CoZrMoNi, a single-layer film of an amorphous magnetic material, a mixture film, or a multi-layered film.

<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Now, described below is the operation of the magneto-resistance effect head <b>63</b><i>a</i>. Application of an external magnetic field to the magneto-resistance effect head <b>63</b><i>a </i>will cause a magnetic field to be applied to the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>via the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. Then, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied by the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>via the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, antiferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. And, the orientation of magnetization of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>changes in accordance with the direction and the magnitude of this magnetic field. Since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer <b>5</b> is pinned by the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer <b>5</b> and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>. In this state, the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> and the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Now, an effect of this embodiment is described below. In the magneto-resistance effect head <b>63</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>from the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>through two steps of process, thereby assuring the application of the vertical bias magnetic field and facilitating the control of the amount of application of the magnetic field. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the fixed layer <b>5</b> are not arranged near the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>but only the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>is disposed near the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. This allows the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>to apply a magnetic field to the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>positively and effectively, also making it possible to prevent the leakage of sense current from the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>or the fixed layer <b>5</b> to the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>

<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Now, the structure of the magneto-resistance effect head <b>65</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment is described below.

On top of the lower conductive layer <b>1</b>, formed is the pattern <b>29</b><i>a </i>made up of the underlying layer for fixing layer <b>6</b><i>a</i>, the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, the fixed layer <b>5</b>, the first non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b>, which have been patterned. The insulation layer <b>11</b> is arranged on the periphery of the pattern <b>29</b><i>a</i>, and the pattern <b>29</b><i>a </i>is buried in the insulation layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The upper surface of the insulation layer <b>11</b> is flush with that of the pattern <b>29</b><i>a </i>near the pattern <b>29</b><i>a </i>but is slightly lower than the upper surface of the pattern <b>29</b><i>a </i>at a given distance from the pattern <b>29</b><i>a</i>, between which a smooth slope connects.

<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Now, the operation of the magneto-resistance effect head <b>65</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment is described below. Application of an external magnetic field to the magneto-resistance effect head <b>65</b><i>a </i>will cause the magnetic field to be applied to the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>via the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. Subsequently, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied from the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>via the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> by means of a magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, anti-ferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. And, the orientation of magnetization of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>changes in accordance with the direction and magnitude of this magnetic field. Since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer is pinned by the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer <b>5</b> and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>. In this state, the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> and the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Now, an effect of this embodiment is described below.

<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Now, the operation of the magneto-resistance effect head <b>66</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment is described below. When an external magnetic field is applied to the magneto-resistance effect head <b>66</b><i>a</i>, the magnetic field is applied to the second magnetic layer <b>12</b> via the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. Subsequently, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied from the second magnetic layer <b>12</b> to the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>via the third non-magnetic layer <b>13</b> by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, anti-ferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. Furthermore, the vertical bias magnetic field is applied from the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>via the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, anti-ferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The orientation of magnetization of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>changes in accordance with the direction and magnitude of this magnetic field. Since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer <b>5</b> is pinned by the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer <b>5</b> and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>. In this state, the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> and the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Now, an effect of this embodiment is described below. In the magneto-resistance effect head <b>65</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>from the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>through three steps of process, thereby assuring the application of the vertical bias magnetic field and facilitating the control of the amount of application of the magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Another advantage of the magneto-resistance effect head <b>65</b><i>a </i>is provided when the layered film made up of the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b</i>, the third non-magnetic layer <b>13</b>, and the second magnetic layer <b>12</b> produces a strong anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the second magnetic layer <b>12</b>. The advantage is also provided when the magnetization of the magnetic layer <b>8</b> (the product of the saturation magnetization and the film thickness) is made substantially equal to that of the second magnetic layer <b>12</b>. In this case, the foregoing layered film is turned to a merged film having effectively no magnetization, thus providing no sensitivity to the magnetic field of an external magnetic field applied. For this reason, in this case, only the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, has sensitivity to an external magnetic field. Thus, the width of the tracks is determined only by the pattern width of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>when the magneto-resistance effect head <b>65</b><i>a </i>functions as the read head. This is advantageous in making a narrow-track head. Incidentally, even in this case, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied precisely to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>through the aforementioned process. In addition, that the magnetization of the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>is substantially equal to that of the second magnetic layer <b>12</b> means that they are equal to each other to the degree that the aforementioned effect is recognized.</p>

<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The magneto-resistance effect element <b>39</b><i>a </i>is provided with the lower shield layer <b>16</b>, and the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> is provided on the lower shield layer <b>16</b>.

The pattern <b>29</b><i>e </i>is buried in the insulation layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The upper surface of the insulation layer <b>11</b> is generally flush with that of the pattern <b>29</b><i>e </i>near the pattern <b>29</b><i>e </i>but is slightly lower than the upper surface of the pattern <b>29</b><i>e </i>at a given distance from the pattern <b>29</b><i>e</i>. The pattern of the underlying layer for vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>is provided to allow at least part thereof in the direction of film thickness to be buried in the insulation layer <b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0276" num="0275">On top of the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b>, the pattern <b>29</b><i>f </i>is provided which is made up of the fourth magnetic layer <b>18</b>, the second free layer <b>19</b>, the fifth non-magnetic layer <b>25</b>, the second fixed layer <b>26</b>, the second fixing layer <b>27</b>, and the upper layer <b>7</b>, which have been patterned, with the pattern <b>29</b><i>f </i>being buried in the insulation layer <b>11</b><i>b</i>. In addition, the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> and the upper shield layer <b>17</b> are provided on the pattern <b>29</b><i>f </i>and the insulation layer <b>11</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Now, the operation of the magneto-resistance effect element <b>39</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment is described below. When a sensor containing the magneto-resistance effect element <b>39</b><i>a </i>is subjected to an external magnetic field, the second free layer <b>19</b>, like the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, serves as a magnetic layer which changes its orientation of magnetization in accordance with the orientation and magnitude of the magnetic field. The fifth non-magnetic layer <b>25</b> is disposed between the second free layer <b>19</b> and the second fixed layer <b>26</b>, and varies in electrical resistance in accordance with the angle between the orientation of magnetization of the second free layer and that of the second fixed layer <b>26</b>. The orientation of magnetization of the second fixed layer <b>26</b> is pinned by the second fixing layer <b>27</b>. Thus, a change in orientation of magnetization of the free layer in accordance with the orientation and magnitude of an external magnetic field would cause a change to occur between the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer, the orientation of which is pinned, and that of the free layer. This results in a change in resistance of the fifth non-magnetic layer <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">In the magneto-resistance effect element <b>39</b><i>a</i>, the amount of a change in electrical resistance produced upon conducting a sense current from the lower conductive layer <b>1</b> to the upper conductive layer <b>15</b> is equal to the sum of a change in electrical resistance of the pattern <b>29</b><i>e </i>located below the magnetic layer <b>8</b> and a change in electrical resistance of the pattern <b>29</b><i>f </i>located above the magnetic layer <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Generally, in the magneto-resistance effect element, the free layer is unavoidably subjected to the influence of a circular electric magnetic field caused by a current flowing perpendicularly to the film surface. However, in the magneto-resistance effect element <b>39</b><i>a </i>according to this embodiment, the influence of the electric magnetic field to which the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>is subjected is opposite to that of the electric magnetic field to which the second free layer <b>19</b> is subjected, thereby canceling out the influences as a whole. Thus, it is made possible to significantly reduce the influence of the electric magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">In addition, in the magneto-resistance effect element <b>39</b><i>a</i>, the vertical bias magnetic field applied is first applied to the second magnetic layer <b>8</b> via the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. Then, the vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>from the second magnetic layer <b>8</b> via the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> and to the second free layer <b>19</b> through the fourth non-magnetic layer <b>18</b>. The second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> controls the magnetic coupling between the second magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>by the component material and film thickness thereof, while the fourth non-magnetic layer <b>18</b> controls the magnetic coupling between the magnetic layer <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the second free layer <b>19</b> by the component material and film thickness thereof. As described above, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the second free layer <b>19</b> from the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>through two steps of process, thereby assuring the application of the vertical bias magnetic field and facilitating the control of the amount of application of the magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Incidentally, in this embodiment, the underlying layer for vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>a</i>, the underlying layer for fixing layer <b>6</b><i>a</i>, the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b>, the fourth magnetic layer <b>18</b>, and the upper layer <b>7</b> can be omitted. Furthermore, in some cases, a protective layer for protecting the vertical bias layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">In addition, in this embodiment, it has been explained in which the underlying layer for fixing layer <b>6</b><i>a</i>, the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, the fixed layer <b>5</b>, the first non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, the free layer <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and the second non-magnetic layer <b>9</b> are patterned in the same way. However, it is necessary to pattern at least the free layer <b>3</b><i>b </i>but not necessary to pattern the underlying layer for fixing layer <b>6</b><i>a</i>, the fixing layer <b>6</b><i>b</i>, the fixed layer <b>5</b>, and the first non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0315" num="0314"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 107</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an embodiment of a magnetic storage system employing the magneto-resistance transducer system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref>. This magnetic storage system comprises a magneto-resistance transducer system having a magnetic read/write head <b>103</b>, sense current detecting means <b>107</b>, and a controller <b>108</b>. The magnetic storage system also comprises a magnetic storage medium <b>102</b> having a plurality of tracks for storing data, a first actuator <b>106</b> having a VCM (Voice Coil Motor) for moving the magnetic read/write head <b>103</b> to a given position on the magnetic storage medium <b>102</b>, and a second actuator <b>101</b> having a motor for rotating the magnetic storage medium <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0316" num="0315"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a specific embodiment of the magnetic storage system. In this embodiment, a read head <b>51</b> and a write head <b>50</b> are formed on a board <b>52</b> that also serves as a head slider and positioned on a storage medium <b>53</b> for read operation. The storage medium <b>53</b> rotates and the head slider moves relatively thereto 0.2 μm or less above the storage medium <b>53</b> or in contact therewith.

<p id="p-0317" num="0316">As the magnetic memory system of the present invention, it is possible to employ hard disk devices, flexible disk devices, and magnetic tape units. The hard disk devices include a fixed disk device that allows no disks to be replaced and a disk device that allows disks to be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Now, described below is a prototype of a magnetic memory device fabricated according to the present invention. The magnetic memory device comprises three magnetic disks (magnetic storage media) on the base and houses, on the reverse side of the base, a head drive circuit, a signal processing circuit, and an input/output interface. The magnetic memory device is connected to the outside by a 32-bit bus line. The magnetic memory device is provided with six heads arranged on both sides of a magnetic disk, a rotary actuator for driving the heads (actuator means), and a drive circuit, a control circuit, and a motor directly connected to the disk rotating for use therewith.

<p id="p-0344" num="0343">The structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a read output as high as 2.8 to 3.1 mV but S/N ratio as low as 18 to 21 dB. This was caused by Barkhausen noise included in the read signal. It was found by measuring the R-H loop of the head that the hysteresis produced by the inversion of the free layer magnetization was so high as to cause the Barkhausen noise involved in the magnetic wall displacement of the free layer. In the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is considered that since the vertical bias layer and the free layer are isolated by the insulation layer, the vertical bias magnetic field is not applied sufficiently to the free layer, so that the vertical bias magnetic field does not contribute to the reduction in Barkhausen noise.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">On the other hand, in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the read output was as low as 0 to 1.2 mV, and accordingly the (S/N) ratio was as low as 0 to 17 dB. This is because the sense current leaks out to the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>and thus does not conduct through the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>. In this structure, it may be possible in principle to prevent the leakage of the sense current to the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>; however, the leakage cannot be prevented. This is conceivably because the structure cannot be precisely fabricated to prevent the leakage of the sense current to the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>and conduct the sense current sufficiently through the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>. This results from the fact that the vertical bias layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>is in close proximity to the end portion of the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b> (barrier layer) in the layered body made up of the fixed layer <b>5</b>, the non-magnetic layer <b>4</b>, and the free layer <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0382" num="0381">It can be seen that any one of the structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>21</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>49</b> and <b>64</b> provides a S/N ratio of 25 dB or more, thus providing a significantly improved S/N ratio in comparison with the prior-art example. This is because any one of the structures can prevent the sense current from bypassing the barrier layer, and therefore provide sufficient output and successfully apply a proper amount of vertical bias magnetic field to the free layer, thereby making it possible to sufficiently reduce noise and thus provide a good S/N ratio. Among the magneto-resistance effect heads shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>21</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>49</b>, and <b>64</b>, the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> has the smallest effective track width and provides the best result. This is conceivably because the magneto-resistance effect head shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> has a layered anti-ferromagnetic layer structure of the magnetic layer <b>8</b>, the third non-magnetic layer <b>13</b>, and the second magnetic layer <b>12</b>. This structure is thereby prevented from being subjected to the effect of the leakage magnetic field from the medium, so that the read effective track width is determined only by the width of the free layer <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
