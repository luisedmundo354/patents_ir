<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Historically there are several methods for the preparation of 4-aminosubstituted quinolines and the two most frequent methods involve intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reactions or electrocyclic ring closures of N-(2-carboxyvinyl)-aniline derivatives at elevated temperatures. Cyclodehydration of suitable amide substrates via Vilsmeier type intermediates appears attractive but the literature is scarce and in the example below, the desired amino-quinoline species is unstable under the reaction conditions and the chloro-quinoline is favored [Meth-Cohn, O., Taylor, D. L. (1995) <i>Tetrahedron</i>, 51, 12869].</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The approach described herein is favorable due to the relative ease of preparation of the cyanoacetamide portion from cyanoacetic acid and the desired aniline and suitably substituted aniline that results in the carbocyclic ring. One example exists in the literature where 3-chloroaniline is reacted via a variety of cyanoacetamides to form enaminonitriles, which undergo cyclization to 4-aminoquinolines in some cases. The conditions used to prepare the enaminonitrile are much harsher than those outlined herein and cyclization conditions in some examples do not result in cyclodehydration [Price, C. C., Boekelheide, V. (1946) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 68, 1246]. In addition, the compounds described in this invention contain significantly different substitution patterns.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0022">wherein:</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>are each independently hydrogen, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, substituted and unsubstituted aryl; and</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, R<sup>5 </sup>and R<sup>6 </sup>are each independently hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 2-6 carbon atoms, alkynyl of 2-6 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1-6 carbon atoms, -alkoxyalkoxy-, haloalkoxy-, -alkylheteroaryl, optionally substituted aryl, N-alkylpiperazino wherein the alkyl moiety is of 1-6 carbon atoms, pyrrolidino, morpholino, piperazino, -alkoxy[(N)-alkylpiperazino] wherein the alkyl and alkoxy moiety are of 1-6 carbon atoms, or optionally substituted heteroaryl.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">The cyanoacetamide 1 can be prepared from the corresponding amine and cyanoacetic acid in refluxing toluene with an acid catalyst or in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a peptide coupling reagent. The examples contained herein provide preferred conditions and include use of 1.03 equivalents of cyanoacetic acid relative to amine and 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide in THF at 77-80° C. The optimum procedure allows for filtration of the suspension then dilution with water to allow the product to precipitate and collecting by filtration. This procedure provides a near quantitative yield 1 of sufficient purity to be used in the subsequent step without further purification.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">Use of a water-soluble peptide coupling reagent in THF permits direct isolation of the cyanoacetamide on treatment with water.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">The condensation reaction of the cyanoacetamide with optionally up to tetra-substituted anilines can be performed with the hydrochloride salt or free base of the aniline with trialkylorthoformate using alcoholic solvents at 20-140° C. The optimum conditions for this transformation result from conducting the reaction in iso-propanol at 80° C. with the hydrochloride salt or free base of the aniline and 2.0-7.0 equivalents of triethylorthoformate. These conditions allow for precipitation of the product 2 that is isolated after filtration in good yield and high purity and can be used in the subsequent step without purification.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">The cyclo-dehydration is accomplished with phosphorus oxychloride in acetonitrile, butyronitrile, toluene or xylene optionally with alcohols or amine bases as catalysts at 80-110° C. The transformation may be done by heating the substrate in acetonitrile or butyronitrile with methanol and phosphorus oxychloride. The product salt precipitates from the reaction and can be neutralized directly or isolated and neutralized in a separate vessel to produce 3 in good yield and high quality. Addition of base to the reaction, such as pyridine, triethylamine, or diisopropylamine can provide a significant rate acceleration.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">In accordance with this invention a high yielding and operationally simple process for the production 7-amino-thieno[3,2-b]pyridine-6-carbonitriles in high purity is provided by a process, which comprises the sequence illustrated below:</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0033">The condensation reaction of the cyanoacetamide 1 with 3-aminothiophene can be performed with the hydrochloride salt or free base of 3-aminothiophene with trialkylorthoformate using alcoholic solvents at 20-140° C. The optimum conditions for this transformation result from conducting the reaction in iso-propanol at 80° C. with 3-aminothiophene and 2.0-7.0 equivalents of triethylorthoformate.
