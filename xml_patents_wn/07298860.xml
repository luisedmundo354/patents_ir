<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention provides a system for enabling the assembly and suspension of a plurality of loudspeakers in a line array where the splay angle between the adjacent speakers can be adjusted and rigidly maintained. The line array system utilizes rigging frames that allow for the coupling and supporting of the loudspeakers through the use of adjustable hinge bars. The rigging frames and adjustable hinge bars together form and rigidly maintain the splay angles between adjacent loudspeakers and correspondingly the curvature of the line array speaker assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a rigging system for line array speakers. In particular, the invention relates to a system of assembling and suspending a plurality of line array speakers and adjusting the splay angle between the speakers to control and produce the desired sound radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A line array is a group of often similarly sized speakers positioned adjacent to one another to optimize sound level output over a larger coverage area. Line array speaker systems are often used in large venues, such as auditoriums and concert halls, where it is desirable to reproduce a high sound level across a wide coverage area. Line array speakers provide increased directivity at various frequencies. Providing increased directivity at various frequencies extends the near-field coverage area because the coverage distance from the near field to the far field transition zone is increased with frequency. The ability of line array speaker systems to increase near field extension is well known in the art. For this reason, line arrays offer significant advantages over traditional multi-box sound systems and are preferred for use in large venues.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve an optimal sound level over a desired coverage area, line arrays are strategically positioned in various places, at varying heights and angles, throughout a venue. The positioning of the line arrays is determined by using simple equations that anticipate the performance of differently sized speakers based upon their arrangement relative to one another. The specific height of a line array and angle and spacing between the speakers in the line array are the main variables that govern the sound level output and coverage area of the line array. The height of an array governs the line array's directivity. The spacing of the individual speakers, which is a second-order effect, determines the lobing structure of the line array. For example, a relatively straight array may radiate the sound level desired for far field coverage. For near field coverage, the line arrays often require some degree of curvature to provide uniformity of coverage over a wider vertical angle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Once the optimal speaker arrangement for a given venue is determined, the speakers in the line arrays are then typically arranged and mounted on specially designed racks. Depending upon the desired arrangement, the line arrays are then suspended in the air with hanging equipment and/or placed on the ground. By properly arranging the line array speakers and articulating or curving the line array in the vertical plane at a specific angle, one can provide excellent coverage for listeners seated in both the near and the far fields.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite the advantages that line arrays can provide over traditional multi-box sound systems, there are notable disadvantages with the known line array based systems. With conventional systems, it has been difficult to adjust and maintain the splay angle between adjacent speakers. Maintaining the angles between the line array speakers, and thereby the overall curvature of the line array system, is important to the performance of the sound system. This is especially true when the line arrays are configured for large venues having more than one seating plane. With the presence of more than one seating plane, curvature becomes very important to providing uniformity of coverage and the line arrays are often suspended in the air. Depending on the particular seating arrangement, the speakers must be deployed precisely and maintained at specific vertical angles to avoid phase interference between the sounds from the adjacent loudspeakers. With the current line array systems, it has been difficult to maintain the overall integrity of the line array once suspended in the air. The conventional systems are not truly ‘rigid’ in that the specific angles between the speakers cannot be maintained constant when the system is suspended or otherwise manipulated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another problem associated with the current line array systems is the difficulty of assembling, suspending and adjusting the plurality of loudspeakers in an array to the desired configuration. Presently, substantial, elaborate preparation and labor are required to assemble and install line array systems. The installation time and cost become significant, especially in large-scale operations, which can require many line arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another disadvantage of the conventional systems relates to the transportation of the line array systems from one location to another. The dimensions of the line array system play a significant role in determining the number of transportation vehicles needed, and consequently has a significant impact on transportation and operation costs. Many conventional sound systems utilize loudspeakers with associated frames that are more than 48 inches wide. Thus, it is impossible to vertically double stack the line array speakers with frames in an industry standard transportation type truck, which has about a 96 inch vertical cargo height. Most systems known in the art are designed without the dimensional considerations in mind to ease the actual practice of loading and transporting the systems.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, a need exists for line array speakers that are easy to assemble, transport, and suspend. In addition, a need exists for a line array system having the ability to adjust and rigidly maintain the curvature of the line array system and the splay angle between adjacent speakers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one implementation, a system is provided for assembling and suspending line array loudspeakers. The system further provides for the splay angles between the speakers to be easily adjusted and rigidly maintained. The line array system utilizes rigging frames that are attached to both sides of each speaker in the line array. The speakers are then coupled to one another with hinge bars that attach to and extend between the rigging frames of the speakers. The hinge bars not only support the loudspeakers but can also be easily adjusted to position the speakers at various angles relative to one another. The rigging frames and associated connecting hinge bars together form and rigidly maintain the splay angles between the speakers and correspondingly the curvature of the line array.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another implementation, to form the line array, each speaker in the line array has a rigging frame attached on the left and right sides of the speaker housing. The rigging frames on each side of the speaker housing may then be coupled together with the rigging frames of adjacent speakers, such that the right rigging frame of one speaker may be coupled together with the right rigging frame of an adjoining speaker. The rigging frames are coupled to one another by front and rear hinges.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another implementation, the front of the speakers in the line array are pivotally coupled together by the front hinges of the rigging frames and remain juxtaposed with respect to one another. The rear hinges are, however, adjustable and determine the splay angle between the speakers. The rear hinges can attach to the rigging frames at various points along the hinge. Thus, the angle between the speakers can be increased and decreased by connecting the rear hinges to the rigging frames at different points along the length of the hinge. The more hinge that is exposed when connected, the greater the angle between the two adjacent speakers. The curvature of the line array system as a whole may be articulated based on the splay angles between the speakers. Thus, the splay angles between the speakers in the line array system may be adjustable to create the desired curvature and to provide smooth, even sound coverage to both near and far seating areas.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another implementation, once coupled, the line array may be either suspended in the air or stacked on the ground using one or more line array frames. Dollies and wheels may be coupled to each speaker for ease in moving and assembling the line array system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the invention will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a number of line array speaker systems <b>100</b> positioned on the ground, on the left and right sides of a sound stage, and suspended above the center of the sound stage. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each line array <b>100</b> also includes an array frame <b>104</b> that is used to hoist the line array <b>100</b> in the air or that may be used as a base support when stacked on the ground. Each line array <b>100</b> includes a plurality of line array speakers <b>102</b>. As described in more detail below, respective rigging frames <b>110</b> are mounted to the left and right sides of each line array speaker <b>102</b>. Both the air-suspended and the ground stacked line array systems <b>100</b> may be articulated or curved to achieve the optimum sound radiation to a predetermined area.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a hanging line array speaker system <b>200</b> and illustrates the positioning of the rigging frames <b>210</b> as they would appear on the side of each line array speaker <b>202</b> in the line array system <b>200</b>. To form the line array system <b>200</b>, each speaker <b>202</b> in the line array <b>200</b> has a rigging frame <b>210</b> coupled on the left side <b>245</b> and right side <b>250</b> of the speaker housing <b>220</b>. Although the rigging frames <b>210</b> can only be seen fully on one side of the line array speakers <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the rigging frames <b>210</b> are positioned on both the left and right sides <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> of the array speakers <b>202</b>. The respective rigging frames <b>210</b> may be coupled to the speaker housings <b>220</b> with machine screws set into four pads on each end of the speakers <b>202</b> (i.e., on the left side <b>245</b> and right side <b>250</b> of each speaker <b>202</b>), or other like method of securely fastening the rigging frames <b>210</b> to the speaker housings <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each rigging frame <b>210</b> has a front side <b>211</b> and a rear side <b>212</b>, and is substantially trapezoidal in shape. Alternatively, the rigging frames <b>210</b> may have other shapes as well, such as triangular, rectangular, etc. To form the trapezoidal shape, the front side <b>211</b> is longer than the rear side <b>212</b>. Likewise, the speaker housing <b>220</b> on the left and right sides <b>245</b> and <b>250</b> generally forms a trapezoidal shape, such that the front surface <b>240</b> of the speaker housing <b>220</b> is taller than the back surface <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The rigging frames <b>210</b> on each side of the speaker housing <b>220</b> may then be coupled together with the rigging frames <b>210</b> of adjacent speakers <b>202</b>, such that the right rigging frame <b>210</b> of one speaker <b>202</b> may be coupled together with the left rigging frame <b>210</b> of an adjoining speaker <b>202</b>. The rigging frames <b>210</b> are coupled to one another by front hinges or hinge bars <b>216</b> and rear hinges or hinge bars <b>215</b> that attach to and extend between the rigging frames <b>210</b> of the speakers <b>202</b>. The hinge bars <b>216</b> and <b>215</b> not only support the loudspeakers <b>202</b> but can also be easily adjusted, as further explained below, to position the speakers <b>202</b> at various angles relative to one another. The rigging frames <b>210</b> and associated connecting hinge bars <b>216</b> and <b>215</b> together form and rigidly maintain the splay angles between the speakers <b>202</b> and correspondingly the curvature of the line array <b>200</b>. Both the rigging frames <b>210</b> and the front and rear hinges <b>216</b> and <b>215</b> may be made of heat-treated 4130 premium steel alloy, or other like material.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the line array system <b>200</b> may have a predetermined curvature β to provide uniformity of coverage over a wider vertical angle. The curvature β is a summation of all the splay angles on the backside of adjacent array speakers <b>202</b>. For instance, if the first splay angle <b>221</b> between the first array speaker <b>202</b> and array frame <b>201</b> is set at 0°, and each of the corresponding splay angles <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>234</b> are set at 2°, 2°, 2°, 4°, 4°, 4°, and 6°, respectively, then the curvature β is 24°. Note that the overall front surface <b>240</b> of the line array system <b>200</b> is continuous. For example, the front surfaces <b>240</b> of adjacent array speakers <b>202</b> are substantially flush against each other and there is a little gap, if any, between the two speakers <b>202</b> at their front surfaces <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective front view of a typical speaker <b>302</b> used in a line array system <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the coupling of the rigging frames <b>310</b> on the left and right sides <b>345</b> and <b>350</b> of the speaker <b>302</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also illustrates the substantially trapezoidal shape of the rigging frames <b>310</b> and the speaker housing <b>320</b> and depicts the front and rear sides <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> of the rigging frames <b>310</b>. The front side <b>311</b> and opposing rear side <b>312</b> of each rigging frame <b>310</b> are adjoined by opposing lateral sides <b>342</b> and <b>344</b> of the rigging frame <b>310</b>. To assist in handling the speaker <b>310</b>, the speaker housing <b>320</b> may also include handles <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of a rigging frame <b>410</b>, and a front hinge bar <b>416</b> and rear hinge bar <b>415</b>. As previously noted, the front hinge bar <b>416</b> and the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> are utilized to couple the adjacent rigging frames <b>410</b> to one another. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the front side <b>411</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> is adapted to slidably receive the front hinge bar <b>416</b>, and the rear side <b>412</b> is adapted to slidably receive the rear hinge bar <b>415</b>. The front hinge bar <b>416</b> is smaller in length than the rear hinge bar <b>415</b>, and is designed to pivotally couple two adjacent front sides <b>411</b> about a pivot point <b>420</b>. The pivot point <b>420</b> is provided to allow the front surfaces <b>240</b> of the speakers <b>202</b> of a line array <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to move relative to one another as the splay angles of the speakers <b>202</b> are adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The front hinge bar <b>416</b> has a first arm <b>422</b> and a second arm <b>424</b> coupled to one another at the pivot point <b>420</b>. The first arm <b>422</b> of the front hinge bar <b>416</b> may be slidably inserted into an opening <b>425</b> in the front side <b>411</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> and releasably locked in place. Similarly, the second arm <b>424</b> of the front hinge bar <b>416</b> may be slidably inserted into an opening in the front side <b>411</b> of an adjacent rigging frame <b>410</b> and releasably locked in place. As a result, in a line array such as the line array <b>200</b> shown by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the two adjacent front sides <b>211</b> of two adjacent rigging frames <b>210</b> are coupled so that the front surfaces <b>240</b> of two adjacent speakers <b>202</b> are substantially flush with one another. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the front hinge bars <b>416</b> may be captive in the adjacent front sides <b>411</b> with a small thumb, or slider knob (not shown) threaded through holes in the front hinge bar <b>416</b> (e.g., holes in the corresponding arms <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>) aligned with holes in the rigging frame <b>410</b> after the front hinge bar <b>416</b> is fitted into the front side <b>411</b> of the rigging frames <b>410</b>. Moreover, the front hinge bar <b>416</b> may be locked into the rigging frame <b>410</b> with a release pin (not shown, but see pins <b>1417</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), similar to the release pin <b>414</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for use in connection with the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frames <b>410</b>. The release pins may also provide a means of storage for the front hinge bars <b>416</b> so that they do not get lost or misplaced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Similar to the front hinge bar <b>416</b>, the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> has a first arm <b>450</b> and a second arm <b>460</b>. The first arm <b>450</b> of the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> may be slidably inserted into an opening <b>430</b> in the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> and releasably locked in place. Likewise, the second arm <b>460</b> of the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> may be slidably inserted into an opening <b>430</b> in the rear side <b>412</b> of an adjacent rigging frame <b>410</b> and releasably locked in place. As a result, the two adjacent rear sides <b>412</b> are releasably coupled to one another. The rear hinge bars <b>415</b> may be captive in the adjacent rear sides <b>412</b> with a release pin <b>414</b>, which allows the positioning of the rear hinge bars <b>415</b> within the rear sides <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> to be easily adjusted. Unlike the front hinge bar <b>416</b>, the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> has a plurality of bores <b>455</b> as well as incremental marking of degrees, ranging from 0 to 10-degrees, in 2-degree increments. Similarly, the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> has a plurality of openings <b>413</b>, each hole <b>413</b> marked with a specific numeric angle. By aligning the different bores <b>455</b> of the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> with different openings <b>413</b> in the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b>, the angular relationship, or the splay angles, between adjacent line array speakers <b>202</b> in a line array <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be adjusted at angles of 0 to 10-degrees. The incremental degree markings on the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> and the markings on the openings <b>413</b> on the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> indicate the splay angle between the line array speakers <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) when corresponding bores <b>455</b> in the rear hinge bar <b>415</b> are aligned with the various openings <b>413</b> in the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view of a rear hinge bar <b>515</b> inserted between adjacent rigging frames <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and illustrates how the rear hinge bar <b>515</b> and rear side <b>512</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> are both marked with specific numeric angles to adjust and gauge the splay angle of the speakers <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each of the two arms <b>550</b> and <b>560</b> of the rear hinge bar <b>515</b> may be adapted such that the rear hinge bar <b>515</b> can be inserted into the rear sides <b>512</b> of the rigging frames <b>410</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the plurality of bores <b>570</b> in the two arms <b>550</b> and <b>560</b> of the rear hinge bar <b>515</b> may be aligned with any of the openings <b>513</b> in the rear side <b>512</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> and secured against the rigging frame <b>410</b> by a release pin <b>414</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, positioned through the aligning bores <b>570</b> and openings <b>513</b>. Depending upon which opening <b>513</b> the bore <b>570</b> is aligned with, the splay angle may be set at 2-degree or 1-degree increments. As explained in more detail below, the markings on both the arms <b>550</b> and <b>560</b> and the rear side <b>512</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> indicate at which point the connection between the rear side <b>512</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> and the arms <b>550</b>, <b>560</b> should be made to achieve the desired splay angle. The bores <b>570</b> in the rear hinge bar <b>515</b> and the openings <b>513</b> in the rear side <b>512</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> both represent coupling or connection points at which the rear hinge bar <b>515</b> and the rigging frame <b>410</b> may be coupled to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the coupling of two adjacent line array speakers <b>602</b> and demonstrates in more detail how the rear hinge bars <b>615</b> may be utilized to adjust the splay angle between two adjacent line array speakers <b>602</b>. The front hinge bar <b>616</b> may be first slidably disposed in the front side <b>611</b> of the rigging frame <b>610</b> and then pivotally coupled to the front side <b>611</b> of an adjacent rigging frame <b>610</b>. Once coupled, the front sides <b>611</b> of the two adjacent rigging frames <b>610</b> remain juxtaposed without a substantial gap. Unlike the rear hinge bar <b>615</b>, the front hinge bar <b>616</b> is designed to be disposed at one fixed position within the front sides <b>611</b> of the rigging frame <b>610</b>. In addition, once coupled together by the front hinge bar <b>616</b>, the front sides <b>611</b> of the opposing rigging frames <b>610</b> remain at the coupled position while the line array <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is assembled, suspended, ground-stacked or otherwise manipulated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an enlarged view of an encircled area in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> showing how the rear hinge bar <b>615</b> couples the adjacent rear sides <b>612</b> of the rigging frames <b>610</b>, and shows how each arm <b>750</b> and <b>760</b> of the rear hinge bar <b>615</b> is inserted into the adjacent rear sides <b>612</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the splay angle between the adjacent rigging frames <b>610</b> is adjusted by inserting the release pin <b>714</b> at a desired angle position. Again, by adjusting the predetermined distance between the adjacent rear sides <b>612</b> of the adjacent rigging frames <b>610</b>, the splay angle of the speakers <b>602</b>, and the curvature of the line array system <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is established. For instance, to set the splay angle at 4-degrees, each of the arms <b>750</b> and <b>760</b> may be slidably inserted into openings in the opposing rear sides <b>612</b> of adjacent rigging frames <b>610</b> until the 4-degree marking shows on both arms <b>750</b> and <b>760</b>. At this position, the 4-degree opening on the rear side <b>612</b> aligns with one of the bores in the arm <b>750</b> so that a pin <b>714</b> may be inserted through the opening and the bore to couple the arm <b>750</b> to the rear side <b>612</b>. To set the splay angle at 1-degree, one arm <b>750</b> is inserted into the rear side <b>612</b> until the 2-degree marking shows and the other arm <b>760</b> is inserted into the rear side <b>612</b> until the 0-degree marking shows. Again, the front hinge bar <b>616</b> and the rear hinge bar <b>615</b> may be stored inside of the rigging frames <b>610</b> via release pins <b>714</b> to avoid losing, misplacing or carrying loose parts.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a front view of a line array speaker <b>302</b>. The speaker <b>302</b> integrates the unique acoustical elements into a highly portable and rugged physical package. In one embodiment, the speaker <b>302</b> may weigh less than 72 kg while containing two 600-watt low frequency drivers <b>800</b>, each having a diameter of about 15 inches. Four 300-watt mid-frequency drivers <b>810</b>, each having a diameter of about 8 inches may also be included, as well as three vertically stacked 75-watt, 3-inch diaphragm high frequency compression drivers <b>815</b> each exiting through a throat opening <b>808</b> having a width of about ¾″ to about 1¼″. Each (low/mid/high) frequency driver section may be positioned on the enclosure to align with identical sections of adjacent housings <b>320</b> with minimum separation between adjacent housing driver sections so as to form a continuous ‘line’ of like driver components.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>, the nine speakers (two 15-inch low frequency drivers <b>800</b>, four 8-inch mid-frequency drivers <b>810</b>, and three high frequency drivers <b>815</b>) are incorporated into a speaker housing <b>320</b> that has a width “w” that is less than about 46 inches. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a front view of the speaker housing <b>320</b> having the front cover removed to show an example of how the nine speakers <b>800</b>, <b>810</b> and <b>815</b> would be positioned in the housing <b>320</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the speaker housing <b>320</b> has a throat opening <b>808</b> adapted to receive three high-frequency speakers <b>815</b> stacked vertically in the center of the housing <b>320</b>. The speaker housing <b>320</b> also has openings <b>912</b> to receive two mid-range speakers <b>810</b> stacked vertically on each side of the high-frequency speakers <b>815</b>, for a total of four mid-range speakers <b>810</b>. In addition, one low range speaker <b>800</b> can be positioned on the outside of each of the vertically stacked mid-range speakers <b>810</b> in a corresponding opening <b>906</b> of the housing <b>320</b>, for a total of two low-range speakers <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To configure the speakers <b>302</b> in this manner, the speaker housing <b>320</b> has a transition line <b>900</b> formed at about distance “a” from a centerline <b>902</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and the mid-range speakers <b>810</b> are positioned in side walls <b>1010</b> that are angled adjacent to one another as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a top view of the speaker housing <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and illustrates the angle Φ between the adjacent sidewalls <b>1010</b>. In the example given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>, if the angle Φ between two adjacent side walls <b>1010</b> incorporating the mid-range drivers <b>810</b> is about 90° (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), then the distance (“a”) between the center line <b>902</b> and the transition line <b>900</b> may be about 6.21 inches (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Moreover, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the distance (“b”) between the centerline <b>902</b> and the focal point <b>904</b> for the opening <b>906</b> adapted to receive the low frequency driver <b>800</b> may be about 14.29 inches. The opening <b>906</b> may have an outer diameter (“D”) of about 15.34 inches to receive a 15-inch low frequency driver <b>800</b>. For this example, the width (“t”) of the throat opening <b>808</b> may be about 1.13 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of the speaker housing <b>320</b> taken along line a-a of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, if the angle Φ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is about 90°, then the width (“c”) of the side wall <b>1010</b> adapted to receive the two mid-range frequency drivers <b>810</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) may be about 7.98 inches, and the inner diameter (“d”) for the opening <b>912</b> adapted to receive an 8-inch mid-range driver <b>810</b> may be about 7.25 inches. With the above exemplary dimensions, the width (“w”) for the speaker housing <b>320</b> may be about 45.75 inches (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). With the width of the rigging frames <b>310</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) being about 1.0 inch on each side, the total width of the array speaker <b>302</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is less than about 48.0 inches. Depending on the angle Φ between the two adjacent side walls <b>1010</b>, however, the total width “w” may be less than 45.75, if the angle Φ is less than 90°.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a rear sectional view of a typical transportation truck <b>1200</b> loaded with line array speakers <b>302</b> coupled with rigging frames <b>310</b> on the right and left sides of the speakers <b>302</b>. As previously discussed, it may be desirable to vertically double stack the line array speakers <b>302</b> (speaker <b>302</b> plus rigging frames <b>310</b> coupled) in an industry standard transport type truck <b>1200</b> having about a 96-inch vertical cargo height. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, with each line array speaker <b>302</b> having a width of less than about 48 inches, it is possible to double stack the line array speakers <b>302</b> in a truck <b>1200</b> having about a 96-inch vertical cargo height, thereby reducing the number of transportation trucks <b>1200</b> needed to ship the line array speakers <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 14</figref> illustrate, by way of example, how the line array speakers <b>1302</b> with the rigging frames <b>1310</b> are moved and assembled together to be suspended in the air. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view of an end speaker <b>1302</b> in a line array speaker assembly <b>1300</b> having an array frame <b>1304</b> attached to the rigging frames <b>1310</b> of the speaker <b>1302</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, each line array speaker <b>1302</b> is provided with left and right rigging frames <b>1310</b> and may further have a dolly with wheels <b>1370</b> removably attached to the bottom of each speaker <b>1302</b> in the assembly <b>1300</b>. Additionally, an array frame <b>1304</b> is positioned at a desired location, typically one at each end of the line array assembly <b>1300</b>, and may be attached to the rigging frame <b>1310</b> through the use of the rear hinge <b>1315</b> and front hinge <b>1316</b>, or in another similar manner. The array frame <b>1304</b> includes front and rear receiver blocks (not shown) for coupling the hinges <b>1315</b> and <b>1316</b> to the array frame <b>1304</b>. The array frame <b>1304</b> may be made of 6061 T-6 aluminum or other like material, and may include a plurality of holes (not shown) for fitting shackles <b>1350</b> in order to suspend the line array <b>1300</b> in the air.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A typical line array <b>1300</b> may have only one array frame <b>1304</b>. However, a second array frame <b>1304</b> may be utilized to couple to both the top (or first) and the bottom (or the last) line array speaker <b>1302</b> and suspend the line array <b>1300</b> from both array frames <b>1304</b>. This may create an increased directivity of the line array <b>1300</b>. Using one or two array frames <b>1304</b>, the line arrays <b>1300</b> may be manipulated to suspend pointing straight down or suspend at a very wide vertical angle.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">To suspend a line array <b>1300</b>, one or more shackles <b>1350</b> are pinned in selected holes <b>1355</b> in the array frame <b>1304</b>. The shackles <b>1350</b> are then attached to suspension cables <b>1360</b> and one or more chain motors (not shown) are used to ultimately raise the array frame <b>1304</b>. If only one chain motor is used, one should select a hole <b>1355</b> in the array frame <b>1304</b> that allows the array frame <b>1304</b> to be balanced, taking into account the center of gravity of the line array system <b>1300</b>. This varies with the number of speakers <b>1302</b> in the line array <b>1300</b> and system configuration. A typical hanging suspension uses two chain motors.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The top or the first line array speaker <b>1302</b> is attached to the array frame <b>1304</b>. When the array frame <b>1304</b> is to be suspended, one way to assemble the line array <b>1300</b> would be to first suspend the array frame <b>1304</b>, then attach the first (top) speaker <b>1302</b> by rolling the speaker <b>1302</b> up to the array frame <b>1304</b>. The attachment is accomplished by connecting the rear hinge bars <b>1315</b> to the rear receiver blocks (not shown) on the array frame <b>1304</b>. Using this method, the rear hinge bars <b>1315</b> may be connected first. The first speaker <b>1302</b> should be set so that its baffle angle is 90 degrees in relationship to the array frame <b>1304</b>. This puts the first speaker <b>1302</b> in a zero-degree position. Next, the front hinge bars <b>1316</b> on the first speaker <b>1302</b> are attached to the front receiver blocks (not shown) of the array frame <b>1304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, which is a perspective view of the line array system <b>1300</b> being assembled and lifted, the line array frame <b>1304</b> may be lifted using the chain motor prepared to lift the first speaker <b>1302</b> off the floor. The additional speakers <b>1302</b> may now be moved into line and the front hinge bars <b>1316</b> may be linked first. While pulling the array <b>1304</b> up slightly, the rear hinge bars <b>1315</b> on the additional speakers <b>1302</b> may be pinned at a predetermined distance or splay angle by sliding the releasing pin <b>1414</b> into the desired angle bores on the rear hinge bar <b>1315</b> and the matching hole on the rear side <b>1412</b> of the rigging frame <b>1300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With the above method, additional line array speakers <b>1302</b> may be added as the array frame <b>1304</b> moves up by repeating the process of first pinning the front hinge bars <b>1316</b> and then the rear hinge bars <b>1315</b>. As the array frame <b>1304</b> is lifted slightly, all the fittings should be checked to ensure that the release pins <b>1414</b> are in place and secure, the hinge bars <b>1315</b> and <b>1316</b> are set at the desired angle and the hinge bars <b>1315</b> and <b>1316</b> are set the same on both sides of each line array speaker <b>1302</b>. Also, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, as the array frame <b>1304</b> begins to go up, the dollies <b>1370</b> on the line array speaker <b>1302</b> may be removed. The dolly <b>1370</b> is typically equipped with a quick release latch and side handles (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">There are many other ways to assemble the line array speakers <b>1302</b>. For example, the rear hinge bars <b>1315</b> may be coupled first between the adjacent speakers <b>1302</b> before connecting the front hinge bars <b>1316</b>. With each line array speaker unit <b>1302</b> equipped with a dolly <b>1370</b> and rigging frames <b>1310</b> capable of being connected to each other by simply sliding and inserting a releasing pin <b>1414</b>, unloading the entire assembly and suspending a line array system <b>1300</b> of up to eighteen speakers <b>1302</b> can be accomplished in less time, using less personnel, than it would take to assemble a conventional line array assembly of the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Additionally, the rigging frame assembly may be designed in other configurations that would allow the splay angle between two adjacent speakers <b>1302</b> to be adjusted. Any mechanism that will allow for the front surfaces <b>1440</b> of two adjacent speakers <b>1302</b> to be pivotally connected, while allowing the splay angle between the back sides <b>1424</b> of the two adjacent speakers <b>1302</b> to be coupled such that the angle between the speakers <b>1302</b> can be easily adjusted is within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a rear perspective view of a line array speaker <b>1500</b> coupled to an alternative rigging frame <b>1510</b> on one side of the speaker <b>1500</b>. Although the rigging frame <b>1510</b> can only be seen fully on one side of the line array speaker <b>1500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the rigging frames <b>1510</b> are positioned on both the left and right sides of the line array speaker <b>1500</b>. The rigging frame <b>1510</b> includes a front side <b>1502</b> and a rear side <b>1504</b> that are coupled to the side of the line array speaker <b>1500</b>. The front and rear sides <b>1502</b> and <b>1504</b> may be substantially similar to the front and rear sides <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, respectively, but without the lateral members <b>342</b> and <b>344</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a rear perspective view of one side of a line array speaker <b>1600</b> having a front opening <b>1602</b> and a rear opening <b>1604</b> integrated into the speaker housing. The front and rear openings <b>1602</b> and <b>1604</b> are similar to the openings <b>425</b> and <b>430</b> formed on the front and rear sides <b>411</b> and <b>412</b>, respectively, as the rigging frame <b>410</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As such, the front and rear openings <b>1602</b> and <b>1604</b> are adapted to receive the front and rear hinge bars <b>416</b> and <b>415</b>, respectively (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The back side <b>1606</b> of the line array speaker <b>1600</b> has a plurality of openings <b>1608</b>, where each opening <b>1608</b> is marked with a specific numeric angle similar to the plurality of openings <b>413</b> formed on the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> as discussed above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The front side of the line array speaker <b>1600</b> may have an opening so that a release pin (not shown) may be inserted through the opening on the front side of the speaker <b>1600</b> to engage with the front hinge bar <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a rear perspective view of two adjacent line array speakers <b>1700</b> that are adapted to couple to each other. Each line array speaker <b>1700</b> may have an opening <b>1702</b> on the back side <b>1704</b>. The opening <b>1702</b> may be formed substantially along the center or anywhere in between the left and right sides of the speaker <b>1700</b>. The opening <b>1702</b> is similar to the opening <b>430</b> formed on the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The back side <b>1704</b> of the speaker <b>1700</b> has a plurality of openings <b>1706</b> so that a release pin <b>414</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may be inserted through one of the openings <b>1706</b> to engage with the rear hinge bar <b>1715</b>. Each opening <b>1706</b> is marked with a specific numeric angle similar to the plurality of openings <b>413</b> formed on the rear side <b>412</b> of the rigging frame <b>410</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, so that the splay angle between the two adjacent line array speakers <b>1700</b> may be adjusted as discussed above. The front sides of the two adjacent line array speakers <b>1700</b> may be pivotally coupled to each other as discussed above or any other method known to one skilled in the art.</p>
