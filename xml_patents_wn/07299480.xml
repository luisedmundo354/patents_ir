<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a disc drive apparatus that detects a type of a medium to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, in order to handle a disc appropriately, it is required that a disc drive apparatus detect a type of a medium to be used, as to type and size of the medium and as to whether the medium is a bare disc or accommodated in a cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With reference to a conventional disc drive apparatus (optical disc recording and reproducing device) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, an explanation will be given on how to place a cartridge on a tray, a cartridge holding mechanism, and operations of loading and ejecting of a tray.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reference numeral <b>201</b> denotes a body of an optical disc recording and reproducing device, <b>204</b> a tray, on which a cartridge and a bare optical disc are placed, and <b>100</b> a cartridge, in which an optical disc is accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A cartridge-placing surface <b>233</b> of the tray <b>204</b> is provided in the center thereof with two large and small recesses that are provided concentrically. A large-diameter recess defines a large-diameter disc-placing portion <b>231</b> and a small-diameter recess defines a small-diameter disc-placing portion <b>232</b>, both recesses being prepared for use in accordance with an outside diameter of a disc placed in the optical disc recording and reproducing device <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, the tray <b>204</b> is formed with a front wall <b>234</b>, a left wall <b>235</b>, and a right wall <b>236</b>, which are slightly larger than outside dimension of the cartridge <b>100</b> and formed perpendicular to the cartridge-placing surface <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cartridge preloading member <b>237</b> is provided on an interior part of the tray <b>204</b> to be movable in a front/rear direction, and constructed to be held in a preloaded state on a front part of the tray <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Provided on a back surface of the tray <b>204</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a rack gear <b>288</b> that engages with a final-stage drive gear of a loading gear system <b>281</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A loading motor <b>280</b> provided at the front part of a mechanical chassis <b>201</b><i>a </i>is switched in its rotation direction to enable the tray <b>204</b> to be loaded and ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A traverse base <b>266</b> holds thereon a spindle motor <b>282</b> that holds and rotates a disc, an optical pickup <b>283</b> that reads and writes information from and onto a disc, a traverse motor <b>284</b> that moves the optical pickup <b>283</b> radially of a disc, and a lead screw <b>297</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A rear end of the traverse base <b>266</b> is turnably held on the mechanical chassis <b>201</b><i>a </i>by a torsion spring and a front end thereof is preloaded downward with a light load.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Two slit holes are provided right and left at the front end of the traverse base <b>266</b> to engage with a cam lever <b>285</b> that is inserted thereinto to turn about a rotating shaft <b>292</b> provided on a bottom surface of the mechanical chassis <b>201</b><i>a</i>. The traverse base <b>266</b> is vertically driven upon turning of the cam lever <b>285</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Provided on the traverse base <b>266</b> are two alignment pins <b>214</b> that engage with positioning holes of the cartridge <b>100</b> to keep a clearance between a disc held on the spindle motor <b>282</b> and the cartridge <b>100</b> to position the cartridge <b>100</b> where it does no contact with the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A disc-state detection switch <b>215</b> is provided near the alignment pins <b>214</b>. A plurality of detection switches mounted on a printed board are provided integrally with the traverse base <b>266</b> to distinguish a state of engagement with detection holes of the cartridge <b>100</b>, thereby detecting a state of approval or denial of writing on a disc accommodated in the cartridge <b>100</b>, front and back surfaces of a disc, and the recording capacity of a disc.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An upper base <b>228</b> as an upper lid is provided on the mechanical chassis <b>201</b><i>a</i>. Provided on the upper base <b>228</b> are a clamper <b>210</b> that fixes a disc to the spindle motor <b>282</b>, clamp arms <b>212</b> that hold and make the clamper <b>210</b> vertically detachable from the spindle motor <b>282</b>, and cartridge holding springs <b>229</b> that restrict vibrations of the cartridge <b>100</b> at the time of loading.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The cartridge <b>100</b> is fixed to the tray <b>204</b> by the downward biasing force of the cartridge holding springs <b>229</b>. The biasing force of the cartridge holding springs <b>229</b> functions to urge the cartridge <b>100</b> against the tray <b>204</b> and urge the tray <b>204</b> against the mechanical chassis <b>201</b><i>a </i>from immediately after the beginning of loading to the completion of loading to eliminate looseness generated among the cartridge <b>100</b>, the tray <b>204</b>, and the mechanical chassis <b>201</b><i>a</i>, thus reducing vibrations and noise that are generated at the time of loading and rotation of a disc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An operation of the optical disc recording and reproducing device <b>201</b> configured in the above manner will be described taking the case of reproducing a disc accommodated in the cartridge <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When placing the cartridge <b>100</b> on the tray <b>204</b> surrounded by the front wall <b>234</b>, the left wall <b>235</b>, and the right wall <b>236</b>, placement of the cartridge <b>100</b> on the tray <b>204</b> is completed by sliding the cartridge <b>100</b> obliquely downward from forwardly upward of the tray <b>204</b> while causing a rear end of the cartridge <b>100</b> to push the cartridge preloading member <b>237</b> into the further inner part of the tray <b>204</b>, and finally placing a front end of the cartridge <b>100</b> on the cartridge-placing surface <b>233</b> in a manner to bring the front end of the cartridge <b>100</b> into contact with an inner side of the front wall <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">At this time, the front end of the cartridge <b>100</b> is pushed against the inner side of the front wall <b>234</b> by the cartridge preloading member <b>237</b> and the cartridge <b>100</b> is positioned relative to the tray <b>204</b> without looseness in back and forth and right to left directions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tray <b>204</b>, on which the cartridge <b>100</b> is placed, is automatically loaded inside the optical disc recording and reproducing device <b>201</b> by a drive force of the loading motor <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Until loading of the tray <b>204</b> is completed, the spindle motor <b>282</b>, the traverse motor <b>284</b>, and the optical pickup <b>283</b>, which are held on the traverse base <b>266</b>, escape below a loading path of the tray <b>204</b> in order to avoid interference with the tray <b>204</b>, the cartridge <b>100</b>, and the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Immediately before loading of the tray <b>204</b> is completed, a clamp-arm driving projection provided on the tray <b>204</b> pushes up one side of the clamp arm <b>212</b> that are turnably provided on the upper base <b>228</b> by hinges, and lowers the other side of the clamp arm <b>212</b>, on which the clamper <b>210</b> is held. As a result, the clamper <b>210</b> is lowered to a position where a disc can be clamped.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When loading of the cartridge <b>100</b> placed on the tray <b>204</b> is completed after the clamper <b>210</b> is lowered, engagement between the tray <b>204</b> and the rack gear <b>288</b> is released, a drive force by the drive gear is cut off from the tray <b>204</b>, and only the rack gear <b>288</b> is driven rearward relative to the tray <b>204</b>. The force that drives the rack gear <b>288</b> rearward is transmitted to the cam lever <b>285</b> as torque of rotation, so that the traverse base <b>266</b> ascends along an inclination of the cam lever <b>285</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the traverse base <b>266</b> ascends, the two alignment pins <b>214</b> provided integrally on the traverse base <b>266</b> are inserted into two positioning holes provided on the front part of the cartridge <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cartridge <b>100</b> is caused to be positionally offset relative to the spindle motor <b>282</b> at the time of loading due to looseness between the tray <b>204</b> and the mechanical chassis <b>201</b><i>a </i>and looseness between the cartridge <b>100</b> and the tray <b>204</b>. When a disc rotates while the cartridge <b>100</b> is offset relative to the spindle motor <b>282</b>, noise is generated due to contact between an outer periphery of the disc and the inner wall of the cartridge <b>100</b>. When there is a large positional offset, contact acts as resistance to release the clamped state of a disc which may damage the disc inside the cartridge <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The alignment pins <b>214</b> are inserted into the positioning holes of the cartridge <b>100</b> whereby the positional offset of the cartridge <b>100</b> relative to the spindle motor <b>282</b> is improved and an adequate clearance is ensured between the cartridge <b>100</b> and a disc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Almost simultaneously with insertion of the alignment pins <b>214</b> into the positioning holes of the cartridge <b>100</b>, the disc-state detection switch <b>215</b> is also inserted into the state detection hole of the cartridge <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Unlike the alignment pins <b>214</b>, a large clearance is ensured between the state detection hole and the disc-state detection switch <b>215</b>, so that the insertion is guaranteed with a margin with respect to detection of a state of the cartridge <b>100</b> even when the cartridge <b>100</b> is positionally offset.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With the insertion of the alignment pins <b>214</b> and the disc-state detection switch <b>215</b> into the cartridge <b>100</b>, a center cone is inserted into a center hole of a disc accommodated in the cartridge <b>100</b> and the disc floats in a space inside the cartridge <b>100</b> while the traverse base <b>266</b> ascends.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the disc floats, the clamper <b>210</b> standing by in a clamp position engages with the center cone and clamping of the disc is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, the conventional disc drive apparatus (optical disc recording and reproducing device) described above involves the following problem.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With respect to distinguishing the media, the switches arranged on the traverse distinguishes a cartridge immediately before the completion of loading. In addition, a 12-cm disc and an 8-cm disc are distinguished from each other after the spindle motor is rotated. Therefore, a preparatory time from insertion of a medium to the start is very long, casing such a problem that a desired scene can not be recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since there is not provided any means to detect a state of erroneous placement at the time of loading, there is the possibility that a disc falls off inside the drive at the time of loading and the disc cannot be taken out, if an 8-cm disc of small diameter is erroneously placed, offset from a predetermined position on a tray, which has a large opening at the center thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, if a disc surface is clamped while the disc is erroneously placed, the disc surface may be damaged.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of a disc drive apparatus according to the present invention, a disc drive apparatus <b>10</b> includes a tray <b>20</b>, on which a medium is placed, and a disc drive device <b>40</b>, into and from which the tray <b>20</b> is conveyed by a drive motor (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The disc drive apparatus <b>10</b> is not of a type that a traverse base provided with a spindle motor is moved up and down relative to a medium held in a predetermined height to have the spindle motor loaded on a disc, but of a type that a medium placed on the tray <b>20</b> is moved up and down near completion of loading to have a disc loaded on a spindle motor.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The disc drive device <b>40</b> is configured such that a mechanical chassis <b>41</b> is covered by a top cover <b>42</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a state, in which the top cover <b>42</b> is removed, and a tray holder <b>60</b> is arranged in the disc drive device <b>40</b> to support the tray <b>20</b> allowing horizontal movement of the tray <b>20</b> in a front/rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A clamper <b>61</b> that fixes a disc to a spindle motor (not shown) is supported on the tray holder <b>60</b> by a clamp arm <b>62</b> to be made vertically detachable from the spindle motor.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Slide cams <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> are provided on both left and right side walls of the disc drive device <b>40</b> to be horizontally movable in the front/rear direction. In addition, the left and right slide cams <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> are mounted on both ends of a connection arm (not shown) that is provided in the center of a bottom of the mechanical chassis <b>41</b> to be able to swing around a pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A rack gear (not shown) is provided below the right slide cam <b>51</b>, and the rack gear meshes with a pinion gear that is driven by a loading motor (not shown) provided on a lower portion of the right front side of the disc drive device <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Therefore, when the pinion gear is driven to move the right slide cam <b>51</b> horizontally rearward, the left slide cam <b>50</b> connected thereto by the connection arm is moved horizontally forward. In addition, the loading motor is switched in a rotation direction to reverse moving directions of the left and right slide cams <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The tray holder <b>60</b> is supported to be vertically movable relative to the mechanical chassis <b>41</b>. In addition, projections (not shown) provided on both left and right side walls of the tray holder <b>60</b> are in engagement with grooved actuation cams that are formed on the left and right slide cams <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the left slide cam <b>50</b> and the actuation cams <b>52</b> formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each of the actuation cams <b>52</b> on the left slide cam <b>50</b> is formed with a downwardly inclined portion that is contiguous to a horizontal portion extended rearward from the front side. On the other hand, the actuation cams on the right slide cam <b>51</b> is formed with a downwardly inclined portion that is contiguous to a horizontal portion extended the front side from a rear part.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Therefore, when the pinion gear is driven to move the right slide cam <b>51</b> horizontally rearward and to move the left slide cam <b>50</b> horizontally forward, the tray holder <b>60</b> is held in a high position on the way along the movement path just till beyond midway of the path. Then, the tray holder <b>60</b> descends near a terminal end of the movement path to be switched to a low position to be held there.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, when the loading motor is switched in the rotation direction so that the right slide cam <b>51</b> moves horizontally forward and the left slide cam <b>50</b> moves horizontally rearward, the tray holder <b>60</b> ascends to a high position from a low position near a starting end of the movement path and thereafter it is held in a high position.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The high position of the tray holder <b>60</b> is a height at which loading and ejecting of a medium are performed, while the low position of the tray holder <b>60</b> is a height at which a medium is loaded on a spindle motor (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the left slide cam <b>50</b> is provided with a ladder portion <b>53</b> that includes a plurality of slits formed with a uniform space along a moving direction of the slide cam <b>50</b>. Optical sensors <b>55</b> are mounted on a printed board to interpose the ladder portion <b>53</b> from left and right, and fixed to the bottom of the mechanical chassis <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Therefore, when the slide cam <b>50</b> moves, the optical sensor <b>55</b> detects light passing through the slit of the ladder portion <b>53</b>, whereby a pulsed output is obtained. A counter (not shown) counts the pulsed output, thereby enabling accurate recognition of a present position of the slide cam <b>50</b> in a region of movement in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view showing the tray <b>20</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view showing the tray <b>20</b> as viewed from the back surface thereof. The tray <b>20</b> is configured to be able to place thereon a cartridge <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) that accommodates therein a disc, and bare discs <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12) and 3</figref> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) of two large and small sizes, as a medium.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the tray <b>20</b> includes a cartridge-placing surface <b>21</b> to place thereon the cartridge <b>1</b>, a large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b> to place thereon a large-diameter (for example, 12 cm) disc <b>2</b>, and a small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> to place thereon a small-diameter (for example, 8 cm) disc <b>3</b>, such that central positions of the discs are made coincident vertically with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">That is, the cartridge-placing surface <b>21</b> on the tray <b>20</b> is formed to be a recess having a size to accommodate therein the cartridge <b>1</b>, in comparison with heights in front and in rear, and a left wall <b>24</b> and a right wall <b>25</b>, which are formed on both left and right sides of the tray <b>20</b>, function as left and right positioning guides when the cartridge <b>1</b> is to be placed on the tray <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b> and the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> are arranged concentrically in a central position of a disc accommodated in the cartridge <b>1</b> on the cartridge-placing surface <b>21</b>, the large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b> being slightly recessed relative to the cartridge-placing surface <b>21</b>, and the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> being slightly recessed relative to the large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">An opening <b>26</b> of a predetermined width to be clear of an optical pickup (not shown) provided in the disc drive device <b>40</b> is formed on the cartridge-placing surface <b>21</b>, the large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b>, and the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> on the tray <b>20</b> to extend through central portions thereof and along the front/rear direction, in which the tray <b>20</b> moves.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a rack gear <b>27</b> is provided on a back surface of the tray <b>20</b> to mesh with a drive gear that is driven by a loading motor (not shown) provided in a lower portion of the right front side of the disc drive device <b>40</b>. The tray <b>20</b> is configured to make it possible to select loading (carrying-in) and ejecting (carrying-out) upon switching the rotation direction of the loading motor.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this manner, the pinion gear to drive the right slide cam <b>51</b>, and the drive gear to drive the tray <b>20</b> are driven by the same loading motor. Therefore, the optical sensor <b>55</b> detects light passing through the slit of the ladder portion <b>53</b> provided on the left slide cam <b>50</b>, and the counter counts pulse outputs thus obtained, thereby enabling accurate recognition of not only a position of the slide cam <b>50</b> but also the present position of the tray <b>20</b> in the region of movement in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>, the tray <b>20</b> is formed with a plurality of detection holes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> for detection of a medium.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">That is, the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a </i>are formed on the cartridge-placing surface <b>21</b> of the tray <b>20</b> to be symmetrical in the left and right directions rearward of the large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The detection holes <b>30</b><i>b </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>are formed on the large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b> to be symmetrical in the left and right directions rearward of the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b>, and the detection holes <b>30</b><i>e </i>and <b>31</b><i>e </i>are formed on the large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b> to be symmetrical in the left and right directions forward of the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">All the detection holes <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>e </i>and <b>31</b><i>e </i>are arranged slightly inside of an outer diameter of a recording surface of the large-diameter disc (12-cm disc) <b>2</b> placed in a predetermined position on the large-diameter disc-placing surface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The detection holes <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>31</b><i>c </i>are formed in the rear side on the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> to be symmetrical in the left and right direction, and the detection holes <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>d </i>are formed in the front side on the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> to be symmetrical in the left and right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">All the detection holes <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>d </i>are arranged slightly inside of an outer diameter of a recording surface of the small-diameter disc (8-cm disc) <b>3</b> placed in a predetermined position on the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, two light emitting diodes <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> are provided in the front side of the disc drive device <b>40</b> forwardly of the tray holder <b>60</b> and symmetrical in the left and right directions and to be positioned just below the straight lines L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, the light emitting diodes being mounted on the printed board to be fixed to the bottom of the mechanical chassis <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, two light receiving diodes <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> are provided in the forward side of the disc drive device <b>40</b> to be symmetrical in the left and right directions and to be positioned just above the light emitting diodes <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>, the light receiving diodes being mounted on the printed board to be fixed to the back surface of the top cover <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Therefore, the light emitting diode <b>32</b> and the light receiving diode <b>34</b> constitute a first photo-coupler (optical-path generating member) <b>36</b>, and the light emitting diode <b>33</b> and the light receiving diode <b>35</b> constitute a second photo-coupler (optical-path generating member) <b>37</b> (see FIG. <b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As the tray <b>20</b> is moved, an optical path generated by the first photo-coupler <b>36</b> is shaded when the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>30</b><i>e </i>aligned on the straight line L<b>1</b> are closed, and at this time, an output of the light receiving diode <b>34</b> becomes “L” (Low) level. On the other hand, when the detection holes are opened, they transmit light therethrough, and at this time, an output of the light receiving diode <b>34</b> becomes “H” (High) level.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Likewise, as the tray <b>20</b> is moved, an optical path generated by the second photo-coupler <b>37</b> is shaded when the detection holes <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>e </i>aligned on the straight line L<b>2</b> are closed, and at this time, an output of the light receiving diode <b>35</b> becomes “L” (Low) level.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The first and second photo-couplers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are connected to a detection circuit <b>38</b> that detects a state including a type of a medium, based on outputs of the light receiving diodes <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the first and second photo-couplers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> are connected to the detection circuit <b>38</b> to input thereinto outputs of the light receiving diode <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>, and the optical sensor <b>55</b> is connected to the detection circuit <b>38</b> to input thereinto a pulsed output.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The detection circuit <b>38</b> includes a counter that counts a pulsed output obtained by using the optical sensor <b>55</b> to detect light passing through the slit of the ladder portion <b>53</b> provided on the left slide cam <b>50</b>, and the detection circuit <b>38</b> functions as an encoder for confirmation of a position of the moving slide cam <b>50</b>. Therefore, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can accurately recognize the present positions of the slide cam <b>50</b> and the tray <b>20</b> in their region of movement in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, when the loading motor is driven to load the tray <b>20</b> into the disc drive device <b>40</b>, the detection circuit <b>38</b> monitors output levels of the light receiving diode <b>34</b> to be able to recognize an opened or closed state of the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>30</b><i>e</i>, and likewise monitors output levels of the light receiving diode <b>35</b> to be able to recognize an opened or closed state of the detection holes <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>e. </i></p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">That is, when the cartridge <b>1</b> is placed in a predetermined position on the cartridge-placing surface <b>21</b> of the tray <b>20</b> to be loaded, all the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d</i>, <b>31</b><i>d</i>, <b>30</b><i>e </i>and <b>31</b><i>e </i>are closed by the cartridge <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, so that data of shade patterns are as indicated in (1) of the internal table <b>39</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Accordingly, when the loading motor is driven to load the tray <b>20</b> into the disc drive device <b>40</b>, the detection circuit <b>38</b> temporarily stores, in a memory, those data of shade patterns of the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d</i>, <b>31</b><i>d</i>, <b>30</b><i>e </i>and <b>31</b><i>e</i>, which are obtained by monitoring output levels of the light receiving diodes <b>34</b> and <b>35</b>.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">An operation of the disc drive apparatus <b>10</b> configured in the above manner will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When any one of the cartridge <b>1</b>, the large-diameter disc (12-cm disc) <b>2</b>, and the small-diameter disc (8-cm disc) <b>3</b> is placed and an insertion force is applied to the tray <b>20</b> in a state that the tray <b>20</b> is ejected and drawn out from the disc drive device <b>40</b>, an operation of loading the tray <b>20</b> in the disc drive device <b>40</b> is manually started.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the course of the manual loading operation, an eject end switch (not shown) of the tray <b>20</b> detects passage of the tray and a signal thereof turns ON the power of the loading motor. Thereby, the drive gear begins rotation to start movement of the tray <b>20</b> in a loading direction, and the pinion gear begins rotation to start movement of the slide cam <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">At this time, both the optical path of the first photo-coupler <b>36</b> composed of the light emitting diode <b>32</b> and the light receiving diode <b>34</b> and the optical path of the second photo-coupler <b>37</b> composed of the light emitting diode <b>33</b> and the light receiving diode <b>35</b> are shaded by the tray <b>20</b>, so that outputs of the light receiving diodes <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> are kept at “L” level.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In a process thus started, in which the tray <b>20</b> is moved in the loading direction, the detection circuit <b>38</b> counts pulsed outputs of the optical sensor <b>55</b> to accurately recognize the present position of the tray <b>20</b> in the region of movement in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, as the tray <b>20</b> is moved in the loading direction, the detection circuit <b>38</b> monitors respective output levels of the light receiving diodes <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> when the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a</i>, the detection holes <b>30</b><i>b </i>and <b>31</b><i>b</i>, the detection holes <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>31</b><i>c</i>, the detection holes <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>d</i>, and the detection holes <b>30</b><i>e </i>and <b>31</b><i>e </i>come to positions of the photo-couplers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> by turns, thus obtaining data of shade patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">By making a comparison between the data of shade patterns thus obtained and the reference data of shade patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can detect which of the cartridge <b>1</b>, the large-diameter disc (12-cm disc) <b>2</b>, and the small-diameter disc (8-cm disc) <b>3</b> corresponds to a medium placed on the tray <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In addition, when a position of a medium on the tray <b>20</b> is offset from a predetermined position on a predetermined placing surface, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can detect such offset in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">That is, for example, when a small-diameter disc (8-cm disc) <b>3</b> is placed rearwardly offset from the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> of the tray <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, shade patterns for the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>30</b><i>e </i>make “H”, “L”, “L”, “H” and “H” when represented in terms of output levels of the light receiving diode <b>34</b>. It is the same with shade patterns for the detection holes <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Such shade patterns are different from any of (1) to (4) of the internal table <b>39</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Therefore, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can detect the fact that a medium is placed offset from a predetermined position on the tray <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Moreover, for example, when a small-diameter disc (8-cm disc) <b>3</b> is placed slightly offset in the front side of the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> of the tray <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, shade patterns for the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>30</b><i>e </i>make “H”, “H”, “H”, “L” and “H” when represented in terms of output levels of the light receiving diode <b>34</b>. It is the same with shade patterns for the detection holes <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Such shade patterns are also different from any of (1) to (4) of the internal table <b>39</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Therefore, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can detect the fact that a medium is placed offset from a predetermined position on the tray <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Moreover, for example, when a small-diameter disc (8-cm disc) <b>3</b> is placed further offset in the front side of the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> of the tray <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, shade patterns for the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>30</b><i>e </i>make “H”, “H”, “H”, “H” and “L” when represented in terms of output levels of the light receiving diode <b>34</b>. It is the same with shade patterns for the detection holes <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Such shade patterns are also different from any of (1) to (4) of the internal table <b>39</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Therefore, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can detect the fact that a medium is placed offset from a predetermined position on the tray <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Further, for example, when a small-diameter disc (8-cm disc) <b>3</b> is placed slightly offset rightward of the small-diameter disc-placing surface <b>23</b> of the tray <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, shade patterns for the detection holes <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>e </i>remain unchanged from the reference shade patterns while all shade patterns for the detection holes <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>30</b><i>e </i>make “H” when represented in terms of output levels of the light receiving diode <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Such shade patterns are also different from any of (1) to (4) of the internal table <b>39</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Therefore, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can detect the fact that a medium is placed offset from a predetermined position on the tray <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As described above, when a medium is placed offset from a predetermined position on the tray <b>20</b>, the detection circuit <b>38</b> can detect such fact in a process, in which the tray <b>20</b> is moved in the loading direction, substantially in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Therefore, when it is detected that a medium is placed offset from a predetermined position on the tray <b>20</b>, the loading motor is reversely rotated to eject the tray <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Besides, since both the optical path of the first photo-coupler <b>36</b> composed of the light emitting diode <b>32</b> and the light receiving diode <b>34</b> and the optical path of the second photo-coupler <b>37</b> composed of the light emitting diode <b>33</b> and the light receiving diode <b>35</b> are arranged in the front side of the disc drive device <b>40</b>, positional offset of a medium on the tray <b>20</b> can be detected in a stage as early as possible in a process, in which the tray <b>20</b> is moved in the loading direction.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">By this operation, it is possible to prevent beforehand, for example, a disc from falling off inside the drive of the disc drive device <b>40</b> from the opening <b>26</b> of the tray <b>20</b> in a process, in which the tray <b>20</b> is moved in the loading direction.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In addition, since detection can be made to reversely rotate the loading motor before the disc is clamped, the disc will not be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The disc drive apparatus according to the invention makes it possible to configure a medium detection system of a simple constitution.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The disc drive apparatus according to the invention also makes it possible to detect states in many positions by a small number of parts.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">With the disc drive apparatus according to the invention, arrangement and combination of the detection holes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> also make it possible to distinguish an 8-cm disc, a 12-cm disc, and a cartridge from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Further, with the disc drive apparatus according to the invention, even slight offset can be detected by the detection holes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> when a disc is erroneously placed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">With the disc drive apparatus according to the invention, it is also possible to shorten a starting time as compared with the conventional apparatus since a medium can be distinguished while the tray <b>20</b> is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Moreover, with the disc drive apparatus according to the invention, it is possible to decrease spacing between the detection holes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> since positions can be detected with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Further, with the disc drive apparatus according to the invention, mechanical parts are less influenced because detection is performed in non-contact manner.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In addition, with the disc drive apparatus according to the invention, type of a medium and a state, in which a disc is erroneously placed, can be distinguished instantaneously by making a comparison between various states stored in the internal table and outputs.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, an arrangement of the detection holes <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> on the tray <b>20</b> is not determined univocally, and the optical path of the first photo-coupler <b>36</b> composed of the light emitting diode <b>32</b> and the light receiving diode <b>34</b> and the optical path of the second photo-coupler <b>37</b> composed of the light emitting diode <b>33</b> and the light receiving diode <b>35</b> are also not determined univocally, but these can be appropriately determined taking account of detection accuracy, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Since the disc drive apparatus according to the present invention includes a disc drive device, into or from which a tray member with a medium placed thereon is loaded or ejected by the drive unit, and the detection unit that detects a shape and a type of a medium placed on the tray member in the course of loading of the tray member, it is possible to detect a shape and a type of a medium placed on the tray member in the course of loading of the tray member, and there is thus obtained an effect that when, for example, positional offset of a medium is placed is found in the course of loading, an occurrence of an accident can be prevented beforehand by switching the tray member to a ejection mode.</p>
