<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention pertains to medical equipment, and more particularly, to a therapeutic ultrasound system for ablating obstructions within tubular anatomical structures such as blood vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of ultrasound systems and devices have heretofore been proposed for use in ablating or removing obstructive material from blood vessels. However, all of these systems and devices generally encounter some problems which are not always adequately addressed by these systems and devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first type of problem relates generally to the effective transmission of ultrasound energy from an ultrasound source to the distal tip of the device where the ultrasound energy is applied to ablate or remove obstructive material. Since the ultrasound source, such as a transducer, is usually located outside the human body, it is necessary to deliver the ultrasound energy over a long distance, such as about 150 cm, along an ultrasound transmission wire from the source to the distal tip. Attenuation of the acoustical energy along the length of the transmission wire means that the energy reaching the distal tip is reduced. To ensure that sufficient energy reaches the distal tip, a greater amount of energy must be delivered along the transmission wire from the source to the distal tip. This transmission of increased energy along the transmission wire may increase the fatigue experienced by the transmission wire at certain critical locations, such as at the connection between the transducer and the transmission wire.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to the above, it is important to be able to conveniently connect and disconnect the ultrasound transmission member from the transducer without creating unnecessary stresses on the ultrasound transmission wire, or weakening the ultrasound transmission wire. Since the transducer is a non-sterile unit, and the ultrasound transmission wire is a sterile unit, a transducer can be used with numerous different ultrasound transmission wires in numerous different procedures. Therefore, there is also a need to provide a removable connection between the ultrasound transmission wire and the transducer that can effectively transmit ultrasound energy while maintaining the integrity of the ultrasound transmission wire.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A second type of problem relates to the need for accurately positioning the ultrasound device inside a patient's vasculature, and in particular, where the vasculature contains smaller and more tortuous vessels. To address this need, flexible and low-profile ultrasound devices have been provided which allow the device to be navigated through small and tortuous vessels. However, these devices have not been completely satisfactory in meeting these navigational needs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A third type of problem relates to the removal of particles that are produced when the obstructive material is ablated or broken up. It is important that these particles be removed from the patient's vascular system to avoid distal embolization and other clinical complications.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there still exists a need for improved ultrasound systems having ultrasound devices or catheters which address the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The terms “ultrasound transmission wire” and “ultrasound transmission member” shall be used interchangeably herein, and are intended to mean the same element.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide an ultrasound device that provides an improved connection between the ultrasound transmission member and the transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the present invention to provide an ultrasound device that has a removable connection between the ultrasound transmission member and the transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an ultrasound device with a distal end that can effectively navigate smaller and more tortuous vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an ultrasound device that effectively removes particles from the patient's vascular system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to accomplish the objects of the present invention, there is provided an ultrasound system having a catheter including an elongate flexible catheter body having at least one lumen extending longitudinally therethrough. The catheter further includes an ultrasound transmission member extending longitudinally through the lumen of the catheter body, the ultrasound transmission member having a proximal end connectable to a separate ultrasound generating device and a distal end coupled to the distal end of the catheter body. In one embodiment, the distal end of the catheter body is deflectable. The ultrasound system of the present invention can incorporate one of several embodiments of sonic connectors that connect the ultrasound transmission member to an ultrasound transducer. The ultrasound system of the present invention also provides a method for reverse irrigation and removal of particles.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following detailed description is of the best presently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating general principles of embodiments of the invention. The scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims. In certain instances, detailed descriptions of well-known devices, compositions, components, mechanisms and methods are omitted so as to not obscure the description of the present invention with unnecessary detail.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an ultrasound system according to the present invention for use in ablating and removing occlusive material inside the vessel of an animal or human being. The ultrasound system includes an ultrasonic catheter device <b>10</b> which has an elongate catheter body <b>12</b> having a proximal end <b>14</b>, a distal end <b>16</b>, and defining at least one lumen extending longitudinally therethrough. The ultrasound catheter device <b>10</b> is operatively coupled, by way of a proximal connector assembly <b>20</b>, to an ultrasound transducer <b>22</b>. The ultrasound transducer <b>22</b> is connected to a signal generator <b>24</b>. The signal generator <b>24</b> can be provided with a foot actuated on-off switch <b>26</b>. When the on-off switch <b>26</b> is depressed, the signal generator <b>24</b> sends an electrical signal to the ultrasound transducer <b>22</b>, which converts the electrical signal to ultrasound energy. Such ultrasound energy subsequently passes through the catheter device <b>10</b> is delivered to the distal end <b>16</b>. A guidewire <b>28</b> may be utilized in conjunction with the catheter device <b>10</b>, as will be more fully described below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one non-limiting configuration for the distal end <b>16</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b> of the catheter device <b>10</b>. The catheter body <b>12</b> is formed of a flexible polymeric material such as nylon (Pebax™) manufactured by Atochimie, Cour be Voie, Hauts Ve-Sine, France. The flexible catheter body <b>12</b> is preferably in the form of an elongate tube having one or more lumens extending longitudinally therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the catheter body <b>12</b> has a lumen <b>18</b>. Extending longitudinally through the lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b> is an elongate ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> having a proximal end which is removably connectable to the ultrasound transducer <b>22</b> such that ultrasound energy will pass through the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. As such, when the foot actuated on-off switch <b>26</b> operatively connected to the ultrasound transducer <b>22</b> is depressed, ultrasound energy will pass through the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to the distal end <b>16</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. More particularly, the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> serves to transmit the ultrasound energy from the proximal connector assembly <b>20</b> to a distal head <b>34</b> mounted on the distal end <b>16</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The distal head <b>34</b> has a substantially rigid member affixed to the distal end <b>16</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. In the embodiment shown, the distal head <b>34</b> has a generally rounded configuration, and has a proximal portion <b>34</b><i>b </i>whose outer diameter is slightly less than the outer diameter of the distal portion <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the distal head <b>34</b>, so as to define an annular shoulder <b>38</b> to which a distal end <b>42</b> of a coil <b>40</b> is attached. The proximal end <b>44</b> of the coil <b>40</b> is attached to the open distal end <b>46</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b> such that the proximal portion <b>34</b><i>b </i>is not received inside the catheter body <b>12</b> but is spaced-apart therefrom. Preferably, the outer diameter of the coil <b>40</b> is about the same as the outer diameter of the catheter body <b>12</b> and the distal portion <b>34</b><i>a</i>, thereby forming a generally smooth outer surface at the juncture of the distal head <b>34</b>, the coil <b>40</b> and the catheter body <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The attachment of the coil <b>40</b> to the distal head <b>34</b> and the catheter body <b>12</b> may be accomplished by any suitable manner. One manner is through the use of an adhesive which is applied to the interfacing surfaces to be attached. The adhesive may comprise any suitable adhesive, such as cyanoacrylate (e.g., Loctite™ Corp., Ontario, Canada or Aron Alpha™, Borden, Inc., Columbus, Ohio) or polyurethane (e.g., Dymax™, Dymax Engineering Adhesive, Torrington, Conn.). As an alternative to the use of adhesives, various mechanical or frictional connections, such as screw threads, lugs, or other surface modifications formed on one surface, can also be used, with corresponding grooves, detents, or surface modifications formed in the interfacing surface to be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, a guidewire tube <b>80</b> defining a guidewire lumen extends through the lumen <b>18</b>, the coil <b>40</b> and a bore <b>82</b> formed through the distal head <b>34</b>. The guidewire tube <b>80</b> can be bonded or attached at a location <b>84</b> to the bore <b>82</b> according to one of the attachment or bonding methods described above. The guidewire tube <b>80</b> can extend along the length of the catheter body <b>12</b> if catheter device <b>10</b> is an “over-the-wire” catheter device. If catheter device <b>10</b> is a “monorail” catheter device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the guidewire tube <b>80</b> terminates at a guidewire aperture <b>86</b> adjacent but slightly proximal from the distal end <b>16</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>, at which the guidewire <b>28</b> exits the catheter body <b>12</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The distal head <b>34</b> may be formed of any suitable rigid material, such as metal or plastic. The distal head <b>34</b> is preferably formed of radiodense material so as to be easily discernible by radiographic means. Accordingly, the distal head <b>34</b> may preferably be formed of metal or, alternatively, may be formed of plastic, ceramic, glass, or rubber materials, optionally having one or more radiodense markers affixed thereto or formed therein. For example, the distal head <b>34</b> may be molded of plastic, such as acrylonitrile-butadine-styrene (ABS) and one or more metallic foil strips or other radiopaque markers may be affixed to such plastic distal head <b>34</b> in order to impart sufficient radiodensity to permit the distal head <b>34</b> to be readily located by radiographic means. Additionally, in embodiments wherein the distal head <b>34</b> is formed of molded plastic or other non-metallic material, a quantity of radiodense fillers, such as powdered Bismuth or Barium Sulfate (BaSO<sub>4</sub>) may be disposed within the plastic or other non-metallic material of which the distal head <b>34</b> is formed so as to impart enhanced radiodensity thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> extends through the lumen <b>18</b> and the coil <b>40</b>, and is inserted into a bore <b>62</b> which extends longitudinally into the proximal portion <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the distal head <b>34</b>. The distal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> is firmly held within the bore <b>62</b> by the frictional engagement thereof to the surrounding material of the distal head <b>34</b>, or by other mechanical or chemical affixation means such as but not limited to weldments, adhesive, soldering and crimping. Firm affixation of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to the distal head <b>34</b> serves to facilitate direct transmission of the quanta of ultrasonic energy passing through the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to the distal head <b>34</b>. As a result, the distal head <b>34</b>, and the distal end <b>16</b> of the catheter device <b>10</b>, are caused to undergo ultrasonic vibration in accordance with the combined quanta of ultrasonic energy being transmitted through the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The coil <b>40</b> can be a single coil, a braid, a multilead coil, a cross-wound coil, a rounded wire coil, a flat wire coil, or any combination thereof. The coil <b>40</b> is preferably elastic and is made of a material having high elongation so as to conform to the configuration of the distal end <b>16</b> and to vibrate with the distal head <b>34</b> upon application of ultrasound energy. The coil <b>40</b> can be embedded inside a polymer jacket or coating, such as but not limited to PTFE, polyurethane, polyamide or nylon. The length of the coil <b>40</b> can range from 0.1 to 150 cm. Thus, the coil <b>40</b> provides several benefits. First, the coil <b>40</b> provides an elastic attachment of the distal head <b>34</b> to the catheter body <b>12</b>. Second, the coil <b>40</b> allows the distal head <b>34</b> to freely vibrate independent of the catheter body <b>12</b>. Third, the coil <b>40</b> provides an additional connection between the catheter body <b>12</b> and the distal head <b>34</b> since the coil <b>40</b> will hold the distal head <b>34</b> to the catheter device <b>10</b> in the event that the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> breaks or fractures.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the preferred embodiment, the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> may be formed of any material capable of effectively transmitting the ultrasonic energy from the ultrasound transducer <b>22</b> to the distal head <b>34</b>, including but not necessarily limited to metal, plastic, hard rubber, ceramic, fiber optics, crystal, polymers, and/or composites thereof. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, all or a portion of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> may be formed of one or more materials which exhibit super-elasticity. Such materials should preferably exhibit super-elasticity consistently within the range of temperatures normally encountered by the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> during operation of the catheter device <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">This alloy provides an ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> that experiences minimum attenuation of ultrasound energy, and which has the ability to be navigated through the complex bends of tortuous vessels without experiencing any permanent deformation which would otherwise result in transmission losses.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the proximal connector assembly <b>20</b> of the catheter device <b>10</b> has a Y-connector <b>320</b>. The frontal portion of the Y-connector <b>320</b> is connected to the proximal end <b>14</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. The proximal end of the rear portion of the proximal connector assembly <b>20</b> is attached to a sonic connector assembly <b>66</b> which is configured to effect operative and removable attachment of the proximal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to the horn of the ultrasound transducer <b>22</b>. The sonic connector assembly or apparatus is preferably configured and constructed to permit passage of ultrasound energy through the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> with minimal lateral side-to-side movement of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> while, at the same time, permitting unrestricted longitudinal forward/backward vibration or movement of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. A more detailed description of the sonic connector assembly <b>66</b>, and the operative removable attachment of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to the ultrasound transducer <b>22</b>, are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the ultrasound system according to the present invention, an injection pump <b>68</b> or IV bag is connected, by way of an infusion tube <b>70</b>, to an infusion port or sidearm <b>72</b> of the Y-connector <b>320</b>. The injection pump <b>68</b> is used to infuse coolant fluid (e.g., 0.9% NaCl solution) into and/or through the catheter device <b>10</b>, and more particularly into the lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. Such flow of coolant fluid may be utilized to prevent overheating of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> extending longitudinally through the lumen <b>18</b>. Due to the desirability of infusing coolant fluid into the catheter body <b>12</b>, at least one fluid outflow channel <b>74</b> extends longitudinally through the distal head <b>34</b> to permit the coolant fluid to flow from the lumen <b>18</b> out of the distal end <b>16</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. See arrows <b>94</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such flow of the coolant fluid through the lumen <b>18</b> serves to bathe the outer surface of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, thereby providing for an equilibration of temperature between the coolant fluid and the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. Thus, the temperature and/or flow rate of coolant fluid may be adjusted to provide adequate cooling and/or other temperature control of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition to the foregoing, the injection pump <b>68</b> may be utilized to infuse a radiographic contrast medium into the catheter device <b>10</b> for purposes of imaging. Examples of iodinated radiographic contrast media which may be selectively infused into the catheter device <b>10</b> via the injection pump <b>68</b> are commercially available as Angiovist 370 from Berlex Labs, Wayne, N.J. and Hexabrix from Malinkrodt, St. Louis, Mo.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although the catheter device <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated as a “monorail” catheter device, the catheter device <b>10</b> can be provided as an “over-the-wire” catheter device without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The structural and operative principles of “monorail” and “over-the-wire” guidewire techniques are well known to those skilled in the art, and are not further discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The catheter body <b>12</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is deployed with the use of a guidewire as either a “monorail” or an “over-the-wire” catheter device. On the other hand, the catheter body <b>12</b> can be deployed without the use of a guidewire, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, where catheter body <b>12</b><i>x </i>and its distal end <b>16</b><i>x </i>are essentially the same as catheter body <b>12</b> and its distal end <b>16</b>, except that the channel <b>74</b>, the guidewire tube <b>80</b> and the bore <b>82</b> are omitted from the distal head <b>34</b><i>x</i>. The coils <b>40</b><i>x </i>and ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b><i>x </i>can be the same as the coils <b>40</b> and ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further illustrates the provision of a deflection wire <b>88</b> that extends from the distal head <b>34</b><i>x </i>through the lumen <b>18</b><i>x </i>and exits the catheter body <b>12</b><i>x </i>via an exit port adjacent the proximal end <b>14</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b><i>x </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The deflection wire <b>88</b> can be rounded or flat, and can be made from a flexible and strong material such as stainless steel or nylon. The deflection wire <b>88</b> has a distal end which is secured to the distal head <b>34</b><i>x </i>by bonding, welding, fusing and similar mechanisms, and a proximal end that is connected to a stretching knob <b>90</b> that is provided at the proximal end of the wire <b>88</b>. When the knob <b>90</b> is pulled, the deflection wire <b>88</b> will stretch, thereby causing the distal end <b>16</b><i>x </i>to deflect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When the pulling motion on the knob <b>90</b> is released, the wire <b>88</b> will relax and return to its normally straight orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is also possible to provide a deflecting distal end <b>16</b><i>x </i>by shaping the distal end <b>16</b> or <b>16</b><i>x </i>of the catheter body <b>12</b> or <b>12</b><i>x</i>. Shaping the distal end <b>16</b> or <b>16</b><i>x </i>at predetermined angles with respect to the catheter body <b>12</b> or <b>12</b><i>x </i>provides the same function as deflecting the distal end <b>16</b><i>x</i>. According to the present invention, shaping the distal end <b>16</b> or <b>16</b><i>x </i>can be accomplished by radiofrequency, steam or other heat generated methods. It is important that the shaping or pre-shaping of the distal end <b>16</b> or <b>16</b><i>x </i>not induce stresses or damage to the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> or <b>30</b><i>x</i>. The shaping of the distal end <b>16</b> or <b>16</b><i>x </i>can be done prior to the actual medical procedure or can be done by the manufacturer or the physician using shaping techniques that are well-known in the art. The shaped catheter body <b>12</b> or <b>12</b><i>x </i>can then be re-shaped as desired using the same methods.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention further provides a sonic connector assembly <b>66</b> that effectively connects the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to the transducer <b>22</b> in a manner which reduces step sonic amplification and provides a smooth connection transition of the transmission member <b>30</b>, thereby reducing the stress and fatigue experienced by the transmission member <b>30</b>. The sonic connector assembly <b>66</b> includes a sonic connector that functions to grip or otherwise retain the proximal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, and which can be removably connected to the transducer <b>22</b>. In other words, the sonic connector serves as an attaching element that couples the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to the transducer <b>22</b>. The present invention provides several different embodiments of sonic connectors that can be used with the sonic connector assembly <b>66</b>. Each of these sonic connectors functions to removably connect an ultrasound catheter to a transducer <b>22</b> in a manner which minimizes transverse movement at the connection area while maintaining longitudinal ultrasound energy propagation. In this regard, longitudinal vibrations are desirable, while transverse vibrations may cause breakage in the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. Since the greatest amount of transverse motion occurs at the connection area between the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> and the transducer <b>22</b>, elimination of transverse movements at the connection area between the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> and the transducer <b>22</b> is crucial in protecting the integrity of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> and minimizing the potential for breakage of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the sonic connector assembly <b>66</b> has a sonic connector <b>200</b> housed inside the proximal bore <b>300</b> of a knob housing <b>302</b>. The sonic connector <b>200</b> is enlarged in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for greater clarity. The proximal bore <b>300</b> in the knob housing <b>302</b> has a rear section <b>301</b> that has a proximal opening into which a transducer horn (not shown) may be inserted to engage the sonic connector <b>200</b>. An enlarged bore <b>322</b> is provided at the distal end of the knob housing <b>302</b>, with the enlarged bore <b>322</b> communicating with a channel <b>310</b>. The structure and characteristics of the knob housing and the transducer horn are well-known in the art, and are not described in greater detail herein. For example, the knob housing and transducer horn can be the same as those illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,208 to Nita, whose entire disclosure is incorporated by this reference as though set forth fully herein.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sonic connector <b>200</b> has a central portion <b>210</b> having a vertical through-bore <b>212</b> which receives a locking pin <b>306</b>. The locking pin <b>306</b> is inserted through an opening <b>308</b> in the knob housing <b>302</b> and is received inside the through-bore <b>212</b> to retain the sonic connector <b>200</b> at a pre-determined position inside the proximal bore <b>300</b> of the knob housing <b>302</b>, as best illustrated in FIG. 12 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,208. The sonic connector <b>200</b> further includes a front shaft <b>218</b> extending distally from the central portion <b>210</b>. The sonic connector <b>200</b> also has a threaded stem <b>226</b> extending proximally from the central portion <b>210</b> to permit the distal end of the transducer horn to be threadably screwed onto and removably attached to the sonic connector <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The distal end of the front shaft <b>218</b> has a bore <b>220</b> that terminates before the central portion <b>210</b>. The proximal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> extends through the channel <b>310</b> in the knob housing <b>302</b> and through the bore <b>220</b>, and is dimensioned to be snugly fitted inside the bore <b>220</b>. The proximal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> is secured inside the inner bore <b>220</b> by welding, bonding, crimping, soldering, or other conventional attachment mechanisms. As one non-limiting example, the proximal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> is crimped to the front shaft <b>218</b> at location A.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An intermediate member <b>224</b> is seated in the enlarged bore <b>322</b> and has a bore that receives (i.e., circumferentially surrounds) the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. In other words, the intermediate member <b>224</b> is positioned between the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> and the enlarged bore <b>322</b>. The intermediate member <b>224</b> is preferably made of an elastic material, and non-limiting examples include a polymer or rubber. The intermediate member <b>224</b> functions to absorb transverse micro-motions, thereby minimizing the undesirable transverse vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The proximal end of the Y-connector <b>320</b> can be threadably engaged to the opening of the enlarged bore <b>322</b>. Thus, the intermediate member <b>224</b> is spaced apart from the crimp location A by a distance of about one-quarter wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a sonic connector <b>200</b><i>b </i>that is similar to the sonic connector <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As a result, the same numerals are utilized to designate the same elements in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, except that the same element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes a “b” in the designation. The sonic connector <b>200</b><i>b </i>has a separate tubular member <b>234</b> which is spaced-apart from the distal-most end of the front shaft <b>218</b><i>b</i>. The tubular member <b>234</b> has a bore that retains an intermediate member <b>224</b><i>b</i>, which in turn surrounds a portion of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. Thus, the intermediate member <b>224</b><i>b </i>is now provided inside a tubular member <b>234</b> as opposed to being provided in the knob housing <b>302</b> (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The tubular member <b>234</b> can be crimped to the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. Thus, there are two connection locations A and B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The crimp location A involves a crimp of the front shaft <b>218</b><i>b </i>and the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. The crimp location B involves a crimp of the tubular member <b>234</b>, the intermediate member <b>224</b><i>b</i>, and the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. In this manner, these two connection locations actually provide two spaced-apart connection locations, with one location (i.e., B) being separate from the actual sonic connector <b>200</b><i>b </i>and acting as a transverse absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The sonic connector is normally attached to the transducer at the highest displacement point of the transducer, which is at the connection with the sonic connector. Studies have shown that one area where the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> experiences a great amount of stress is about one-quarter wavelength from the connection with the sonic connector. Therefore, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides a transverse absorber (i.e., <b>224</b><i>b</i>) that is positioned at a location along the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> that is about one-quarter wavelength from the connection with the sonic connector. The configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> eliminates a greater amount of transverse energy at the proximal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, thereby minimizing potential breakage of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. In addition, reduced transverse movements propagating towards the distal end of the catheter <b>10</b> will result in the generation of less heat so that an ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> with a smaller cross-sectional area can be used. This will in turn result in a more flexible catheter <b>10</b> that allows the catheter <b>10</b> to run a continuous wave mode (since pulsing is one method of reduce heat). The combined use of a continuous wave mode of operation and pulsing would allow for the ultrasound ablation of a larger variety of tissues (e.g., soft, hard, fibrous).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The intermediate members <b>224</b>, <b>224</b><i>b </i>function as absorbers that minimize undesirable transverse vibrations. To be effective in minimizing transverse vibrations, the absorber needs to be seated tightly around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> so as to impact the micro-transverse motions vibrations or motions experienced by the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. This tight seat, fit or grip is generally accomplished by creating an additional force, or squeezing the absorber against the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, which can be performed using one of two methods. In a first method, the absorber is squeezed longitudinally. Unfortunately, this longitudinal force may deform the absorber and may create a non-uniform grip which might in turn provide an inconsistent grip around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. Fortunately, this inconsistency can be overcome by providing a plurality of O-rings around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, as described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A second method uses a perpendicular (i.e., transverse) force to compress the absorber around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, and the crimping techniques described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> herein are examples of this second method.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates how the sonic connector <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can be used with a slightly different knob housing to overcome the inconsistent grip around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> provided by a longitudinal gripping force. The knob housing <b>302</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is similar to the knob housing <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, so the same numerals are utilized to designate the same elements in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>, except that the same element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes a “c” in the designation. In the knob housing <b>302</b><i>c</i>, the bore <b>300</b><i>c </i>is provided as a single bore, without the channel <b>310</b> and the enlarged bore <b>322</b>. The ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> extends through the Y-connector <b>320</b> and into the bore <b>300</b><i>c</i>, and a plurality of O-rings <b>330</b> are provided around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> inside the bore <b>300</b><i>c</i>. Thus, the O-rings <b>330</b> function like the absorbers <b>224</b> and <b>224</b><i>b</i>, and are seated tightly around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> adjacent the connection area of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> and the transducer <b>22</b> so as to impact the micro-transverse motions vibrations or motions experienced by the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> at this location where transverse motion is the greatest. In addition, the length of the combined plurality of O-rings <b>330</b> extends across a larger proximal area of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> (when compared to the length of the absorbers <b>224</b>, <b>224</b><i>b</i>), so that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is better suited for use in applications where the transverse motions are greater. In contrast, the embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> may be better suited for use in applications where the transverse motions are lesser.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a modification that can be made to the knob housing <b>302</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In the knob housing <b>302</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the O-rings <b>330</b> are replaced by a single absorber member <b>332</b> retained inside the bore <b>300</b><i>c </i>and around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. The absorber member <b>332</b> can have the same features, characteristics and materials as the intermediate members <b>224</b> and <b>224</b><i>b </i>described above. The length of the absorber member <b>332</b> can be provided such the absorber member <b>332</b> covers the distance from the distal end <b>334</b> of the absorber member <b>332</b> to the sonic connector <b>200</b>, which is about one-quarter wavelength. The embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shares the same benefits as the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates another modification that can be made to the knob housings <b>302</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. In particular, a combination of O-rings <b>330</b><i>d </i>and absorber members <b>332</b><i>d </i>can be retained inside the bore <b>300</b><i>c </i>and around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a group of O-rings <b>330</b><i>d </i>can be positioned between two separate absorber members <b>332</b><i>d</i>, although different arrangements of O-rings <b>330</b><i>d </i>and absorber members <b>332</b><i>d </i>can be utilized as well. The O-rings <b>330</b><i>d </i>and absorber members <b>332</b><i>d </i>can be the same as the O-rings <b>330</b> and absorber member <b>332</b> described above. Again, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shares the same benefits as the embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates modifications that can be made to the knob housing <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, borrowing on the principles illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>. The knob housing <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is identical to the knob housing <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, so the same numerals are used to designate the same elements of the knob housing <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 11</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a first plurality of O-rings <b>330</b><i>e </i>can be retained inside the bore <b>300</b> and around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, and a second plurality of O-rings <b>330</b><i>f </i>can be retained inside the enlarged bore <b>322</b> and around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. In addition, an intermediate member <b>224</b><i>e </i>can be retained inside the bore <b>338</b> of the Y-connector <b>320</b> (at the connection location between the enlarged bore <b>322</b> and the proximal end of the Y-connector <b>320</b>) and around the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. The O-rings <b>330</b><i>e</i>, <b>330</b><i>f </i>and intermediate member <b>224</b><i>e </i>can be the same as the O-rings <b>330</b> and intermediate member <b>224</b> described above. The distance from the intermediate member <b>224</b><i>e </i>to the sonic connector <b>200</b> can be about one-quarter wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The provision of the sonic connectors and knob housings illustrated in FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>11</b> are so effective in reducing stresses on the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> that they facilitate the use of a deflectable distal end <b>16</b><i>x </i>as described hereinabove. Previously-known ultrasound catheters have not been able to enjoy the luxury of a deflectable distal end because any bending at the distal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> would cause the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to bend too, thereby adding to the stresses already experienced by the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>, resisting longitudinal propagation of ultrasound energy, and creating an additional source of heat, all of which would increase the potential of breakage of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b>. Thus, the implementation of the sonic connectors illustrated in FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>11</b> allows for the distal end of the ultrasound transmission member <b>30</b> to be bent without experiencing many of these drawbacks.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention further provides for reverse irrigation to remove particles that have been ablated during the ultrasound procedure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, irrigation fluid can be injected through a guiding catheter <b>240</b> (and along the outer surface of the catheter body <b>12</b>) as shown by the arrows <b>242</b>. The irrigation fluid will travel to the distal head <b>34</b> of the catheter <b>10</b>, and will carry the particles through the channel <b>74</b> in a reverse direction (i.e., from distal to proximal) and through the lumen <b>18</b>. The irrigation fluid and particles will travel in a proximal direction along the lumen <b>18</b> to the infusion tube <b>70</b>, and is collected into a bottle or container <b>69</b> that can be connected to the infusion tube <b>70</b>. During this operation, the injection pump <b>68</b> can serve as a negative pressure pump.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As yet a further alternative, particles can be removed by applying a vacuum to remove the particles via the lumen of the guidewire tube <b>80</b>. For example, in an “over-the-wire” catheter embodiment, particles can be removed via the lumen of the guidewire tube <b>80</b> using a pump or a syringe.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the description above refers to particular embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that many modifications may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. The accompanying claims are intended to cover such modifications as would fall within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.</p>
