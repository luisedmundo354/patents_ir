<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to Class D amplifiers, and more particularly to an improved Class D amplifier.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Amplifiers are typically used to amplify signals that are output to audio speakers, such as headphones, loudspeakers and/or other audio devices. In wired or non-portable applications, linear amplifiers such as Class A, Class B, and Class AB amplifiers have typically been used. Linear amplifiers include a linear output stage that draws a relatively high bias current while sourcing and sinking current into a load. Therefore, these linear amplifiers consume a relatively high amount of power. Because consumers buying portable audio equipment want to have longer battery life, linear amplifiers are not suitable for use in portable audio applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Class D amplifiers have a nonlinear output stage that does not require the high bias current that is used in the linear amplifiers. The increase in efficiency of the output stage, however, is gained at the cost of increased noise and/or distortion. The tradeoff between power consumption and distortion and/or noise has generally been found to be acceptable in portable audio equipment applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an exemplary Class D amplifier <b>10</b> is shown to include a sawtooth waveform generator <b>14</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a sawtooth signal V<sub>saw </sub>includes a positive sloped portion that increases from a minimum value to a maximum value followed by a return to the minimum value with an almost-infinite negative slope. The sawtooth signal V<sub>saw </sub>is input to an inverting input of a comparator <b>18</b>. An input signal V<sub>IN </sub>such as an audio signal is input to a non-inverting input of the comparator <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An output of the comparator <b>18</b> is input to first and second transistors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> that are operated as switches. In this example, the first transistor <b>20</b> is a PMOS transistor and the second transistor <b>22</b> is an NMOS transistor. The output of the comparator <b>18</b> is also inverted by an inverter <b>24</b> and input to third and fourth transistors <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> that are also operated as switches. In this example, the third transistor <b>26</b> is a PMOS transistor and the fourth transistor <b>28</b> is an NMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sawtooth signal V<sub>saw </sub>is compared to the input signal V<sub>IN</sub>. When the input signal V<sub>IN </sub>is greater than the sawtooth signal V<sub>saw</sub>, the output is high. When the input signal V<sub>IN </sub>is less than the sawtooth signal V<sub>saw</sub>, the output is low. Alternately, when the input signal V<sub>IN </sub>is greater than the sawtooth signal V<sub>saw</sub>, the output is low. When the input signal V<sub>IN </sub>is less than the sawtooth signal V<sub>saw</sub>, the output is high. The transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are switched on and off to drive current through a load <b>40</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A Class D amplifier according to the present invention receives an input signal and comprises a signal generator that generates first and second periodic signals. Each period of the first periodic signal comprises first and second intervals, and each period of the second periodic signal comprises third and fourth intervals. The first periodic signal is monotonically increasing during the first interval and is monotonically decreasing during the second interval, the second periodic signal is monotonically decreasing during the third interval and is monotonically increasing during the fourth interval. The first and third intervals are substantially aligned in time, and the second and fourth intervals are substantially aligned in time. The Class D amplifier further comprises a crossing detector that generates a first transition signal when a voltage of the first periodic signal transitions in a first direction across a voltage of the input signal and when a voltage of the second periodic signal transitions in the first direction across a voltage of the input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other features, the first and second periodic signals are characterized by substantially equal periods and substantially equal peak-to-peak amplitudes. The second periodic signal is substantially equal to the first periodic signal phase-shifted by 180 degrees. The second periodic signal is substantially equal to the first periodic signal mirrored across a horizontal constant voltage line. A frequency of the first periodic signal is at least approximately two orders of magnitude higher than a frequency of the input signal. A frequency of the first periodic signal is at least approximately two orders of magnitude higher than a maximum frequency of the input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still other features, derivatives of the first periodic signal during the first and second intervals are approximately equal in magnitude, and derivatives of the second periodic signal during the third and fourth intervals are approximately equal in magnitude. The crossing detector generates a second transition signal when a voltage of the first periodic signal transitions in a second direction across a voltage of the input signal and when a voltage of the second periodic signal transitions in the second direction across a voltage of the input signal, wherein the second direction is opposite to the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other features, the first direction is a positive transition from lower than the input signal to higher than the input signal, and the second direction is a negative transition from higher than the input signal to lower than the input signal. The first direction is a negative transition from higher than the input signal to lower than the input signal, and the second direction is a positive transition from lower than the input signal to higher than the input signal. The crossing detector comprises an edge detector. The edge detector comprises first and second comparators that compare the input signal to the first and second periodic signals, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In still other features, the edge detector generates a first pulse when a rising edge occurs in at least one of first and second comparator outputs, and generates a second pulse when a falling edge occurs in at least one of the first and second comparator outputs. The edge detector comprises a first one shot that receives an output of the first comparator and that generates the first pulse when a rising edge occurs, a second one shot that receives an output of the first comparator and that generates the second pulse when a falling edge occurs, a third one shot that receives an output of the second comparator and that generates the first pulse when a rising edge occurs, and a fourth one shot that receives an output of the second comparator and that generates the second pulse when a falling edge occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other features, the first transition signal includes the first pulse and the second transition signal includes the second pulse. The Class D amplifier further comprises a phase detector that asserts an up signal when the first transition signal is received, asserts a down signal when the second transition signal is received, and de-asserts both of the up and down signals after a predetermined period. The phase detector de-asserts both of the up and down signals after both of the up and down signals have been asserted for a predetermined period. The phase detector delays the down signal before asserting the down signal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The Class D amplifier further comprises an output stage that receives the up and down signals from the phase detector and that selectively drives output current based on the up and down signals. In still other features, the output stage drives output current in a first current direction when the up signal is asserted, and drives output current in a direction opposite to the first current direction when the down signal is asserted. The Class D amplifier further comprises an output stage that selectively drives output current based upon first and second current signals.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other features, the first and second current signals are derived from the first and second transition signals. The first and second current signals are asserted when the first and second transition signals, respectively, are asserted, and the first and second current signals are both de-asserted when the first and second current signals have been asserted simultaneously for a predetermined period. The second current signal is delayed by a predetermined time. The output stage includes a single-ended drive stage. The output stage includes first and second single-ended drive stages, the first single-ended drive stage drives output current when the first current signal is asserted, and the second single-ended drive stage drives output current when the second current signal is asserted.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In still other features, the output stage connects an output terminal to a first reference potential when the first current signal is asserted and connects the output terminal to a second potential when the second current signal is asserted, and wherein the first reference potential is greater than the second reference potential. The output stage connects the output terminal to a third reference potential when the first and second current signals are both de-asserted, wherein the third reference potential is less than the first reference potential and greater than the second reference potential. The output stage includes a balanced H-bridge.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other features, the output stage connects a first output terminal to a first reference potential and a second output terminal to a second reference potential when the first current signal is asserted, and connects the first output terminal to the second reference potential and the second output terminal to the first reference terminal when the second current signal is asserted, and wherein the first reference potential is greater than the second reference potential. The output stage connects the first and second output terminals together when the first and second current signals are both de-asserted.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A system comprises the Class D amplifier and further comprises a load that receives the output current. In other features, the load comprises an audio speaker. A low pass filter is arranged between the output stage and the load.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A method for operating a Class D amplifier that receives an input signal comprises generating first and second periodic signals wherein each period of the first periodic signal comprises first and second intervals, and each period of the second periodic signal comprises third and fourth intervals.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a Class D amplifier <b>100</b> according to the present invention is shown. The Class D amplifier <b>100</b> includes a ramp generator <b>110</b> that generates a ramp signal (V<sub>RAMP</sub>) and an inverted ramp signal (V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub>). As used herein, the terms ramp signal and inverted ramp signal refer to signals having alternating positive and negative slopes, which are substantially equal. The ramp signal V<sub>RAMP </sub>is output to a signal generator <b>111</b> that generates UP and DOWN signals for an output stage <b>118</b>. The output stage <b>118</b> drives current through the load based on the UP and DOWN signals. The signal generator <b>111</b> includes an edge detector <b>114</b> and a phase detector <b>116</b>. The ramp signal V<sub>RAMP</sub>, the inverted ramp signal V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub> and the input signal V<sub>IN </sub>are output to the edge detector circuit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The edge detector circuit <b>114</b> outputs first and second pulses when rising and falling edges of the ramp and inverted ramp signals transition above and below, respectively, the input signal. In other words, the edge detector circuit <b>114</b> outputs a first pulse when V<sub>RAMP </sub>transitions from a value less than V<sub>IN </sub>to a value greater than V<sub>IN </sub>and a second pulse when V<sub>RAMP </sub>transitions from a value greater than V<sub>IN </sub>to a value less than V<sub>IN</sub>, respectively. The edge detector circuit <b>114</b> also outputs the first pulse when V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub> transitions from a value less than V<sub>IN </sub>to a value greater than V<sub>IN </sub>and the second pulse when V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub> transitions from a value greater than V<sub>IN </sub>to a value less than V<sub>IN</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Outputs of the edge detector circuit <b>114</b> are input to a phase detector <b>116</b>. The phase detector <b>116</b> sends an UP signal when the first pulse is received until the second pulse is received. When the second pulse is received, the phase detector <b>116</b> sends a DOWN signal until the first pulse is received. An output of the phase detector <b>116</b> is transmitted to an output stage <b>118</b>, which drives current across the load based on the UP and DOWN signals.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an exemplary implementation of the Class D amplifier <b>100</b> is shown. The edge detector circuit <b>114</b> includes comparators <b>119</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>119</b>-<b>2</b> and one-shot circuits <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>4</b>, respectively. The ramp signal V<sub>RAMP </sub>is output to a non-inverting input of the first comparator <b>119</b>-<b>1</b>. The inverted ramp signal V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub> is output to a non-inverting input of the second comparator <b>119</b>-<b>2</b>. The input signal V<sub>IN </sub>is input to inverting inputs of the comparators <b>119</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>119</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Outputs of the comparators <b>119</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>119</b>-<b>2</b> are input to the one-shot circuits <b>120</b>. In one implementation, the one-shot circuits <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> generate an output pulse when there is a positive edge sensed at the input thereof. The one-shot circuits <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>4</b> generate an output pulse when there is a negative edge sensed at the input thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Outputs of the one-shot circuits <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> are input to OR gate <b>130</b>. Outputs of the one-shot circuits <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>4</b> are input to OR gate <b>132</b>. Outputs of the OR gates <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> are input to a phase detector <b>116</b>. The phase detector <b>116</b> operates in a manner that is similar to phase detectors in modern phase locked loops (PLLs). When there is no phase error in modern PLLs, a very small up and down pulse current is generated. In a Class D amplifier, however, voltage pulses are used instead of current.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one implementation, the phase detector <b>116</b> includes a flip-flop <b>142</b> that communicates with the output of the OR gate <b>130</b> and a flip-flop <b>144</b> that communicates with the output of the OR gate <b>132</b>. D inputs of the flip-flops <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are connected to a voltage bias V<sub>BB</sub>. A Q output of the flip-flop <b>142</b> provides a first or UP signal. A Q output of the flip-flop <b>144</b> provides a second or DOWN signal. The UP signal and the DOWN signal are fed back through an AND gate <b>150</b> and a delay <b>152</b> to reset (R) inputs of the flip-flops <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. The UP signal and the DOWN signal are also transmitted to an output stage <b>118</b>, as will be described below. The ramp signal preferably has a frequency that is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the input frequency (e.g. 20 kHz and 1-2 MHz).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the ramp signal V<sub>RAMP</sub>, the inverted ramp signal V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub>, and an input signal V<sub>IN </sub>are shown. The UP signal is initiated on a rising edge of either the ramp signal V<sub>RAMP </sub>or the inverted ramp signal V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub> crossing the input signal V<sub>IN</sub>. The DOWN signal is initiated on a falling edge of either the ramp signal V<sub>RAMP </sub>or the inverted ramp signal V<sub> <o ostyle="single">RAMP</o></sub> crossing the input signal V<sub>IN</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an exemplary output stage <b>118</b> includes an amplifier <b>180</b> that is switched on when the UP signal has a first state and off when the UP signal has a second state. The amplifier <b>182</b> is switched on when the DOWN signal has a first state and off when the UP signal has a second state.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an alternate output stage <b>118</b> is configured as a single ended drive stage. The output stage <b>118</b> includes an AND gate <b>190</b> with inverted inputs, which are connected to the UP signal and a delayed DOWN signal. The UP signal controls a first switch <b>194</b>. An output of the AND gate <b>190</b> controls a second switch <b>196</b>. The first switch <b>194</b> selectively connects V<sub>DD </sub>to a node <b>200</b>. The second switch <b>196</b> selectively connects the node <b>200</b> to ground. The delayed DOWN signal controls a third switch <b>198</b>, which selectively connects the node <b>200</b> to negative V<sub>EE</sub>. The load <b>184</b> is connected between the node <b>200</b> and ground.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a preferred embodiment, the DOWN signal is delayed by at least the minimum pulse width of the phase detector <b>116</b> to avoid conflict between the switches <b>194</b> and <b>198</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the delay is preferably at least two times the minimum delay described above. The switch <b>196</b> is on only when the UP and the delayed DOWN signals are inactive. In PLL applications, the DOWN signal does not need to be delayed because current is used. Therefore UP and DOWN signals can occur at the same time. With voltage signals, the DOWN signal is preferably delayed to avoid the crowbar short-circuit effect of both the top and bottom transistors being on.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an alternate output stage <b>118</b> is configured as a balanced H-bridge implementation. The UP signal controls first and second switches <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> and is input to an AND gate <b>214</b> with inverted inputs. The delayed DOWN signal controls switches <b>218</b> and <b>222</b> and is input to AND gate <b>214</b>, which has inverted inputs. The output of the AND gates <b>214</b> controls switches <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>, which are connected across the load <b>184</b>. The switches <b>210</b> and <b>222</b> are connected between V<sub>DD </sub>and nodes <b>234</b> and <b>236</b>, respectively. The switches <b>218</b> and <b>212</b> are connected between the nodes <b>234</b> and <b>236</b>, respectively, and ground.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an alternate output stage <b>118</b> that is similar to the output stage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is shown. The output stage <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes an additional switch <b>250</b> that is controlled by the output of the AND gate <b>214</b>. The switch <b>250</b> is connected across the load <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As can be appreciated, the output common mode of the output stages <b>118</b> that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> does not move around and is centered between the positive and negative power supplies.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the signal to the load <b>184</b> can be filtered using one or more low pass filter circuits <b>300</b>. The low pass filter circuits <b>300</b> may include one or more inductors and/or capacitors that remove high frequency switching components. For example, the filter may include a series inductor and a parallel capacitor. The optional filters <b>300</b> may not be needed if the load is an inductive load such as a loudspeaker load, which is mechanically similar to a low pass filter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the following claims.</p>
