<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides a user input device that includes and array of light detectors and a light emitting stylus configured to emit a beam of light detectable by the light detectors. The light beam is wide enough at the plane of the detectors so that at least two detectors are illuminated for all positions of interest. This allows the light beam position to be interpolated to obtain positional resolution that is greater than would be expected simply due to the spacing between detectors. Interpolation can be further aided by using a light beam that has a known variance in cross-sectional intensity. The present invention also provides for determining the orientation of the stylus by comparing the detected shape of the light beam cross-section to the known shape of the light beam cross-section.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Touch sensors have become an increasingly common way for users to intuitively interact with electronic systems, typically those that include displays for viewing information. In many applications, the information is viewed through the touch-sensitive area so that the user seems to interact directly with the displayed information. Depending on the technology of the input device, a user may interact with the device using a finger or some other touch implement such as a stylus. When a stylus is used, it can be a passive object (as is typical for those used with resistive touch screens, for example in a personal digital assistant or other hand-held device) or an active object (as is typical for those used with signature capture devices). An active stylus can communicate signals with the input device, whether sending, receiving, or both, to determine touch position or other information. Active styli include those that send or receive radio frequency signals (RF pens), those that use magnetic fields for inductive signal capture (inductive pens), and those that emit or receive light (light pens).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides a light-sensitive user input device that includes a co-planar array of light-sensitive devices disposed to sense light transmitted through an input surface of the input device, nearest adjacent light-sensitive devices having a center-to-center spacing that is no more than a maximum distance, and a stylus configured to emit a light beam detectable by the devices, the light beam exhibiting a cross-sectional profile having a known shape characterized by an intensity variance across the beam profile. The light beam exhibits a size at the plane of the devices that is greater than the maximum distance when the stylus is contacting the input surface. The input device also includes electronics coupled to the devices and configured to determine the position of the light beam to within a spacing that is less than the maximum distance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention further provides a method of determining the position of a light beam at an input surface. The method includes providing a co-planar array of light-sensitive devices disposed to sense light transmitted through the input surface, emitting the light beam with a known shape characterized by a cross-sectional profile having a known intensity variance, the light beam having a spot size sufficient for the light beam to be detected by at least two of the light-sensitive devices when the light beam is directed through the input surface. The method also includes detecting the light beam by at least two of the light-sensitive devices, and determining the position of the light beam to an accuracy that is less than the center-to-center distance between nearest adjacent light-sensitive devices by interpolating signals measured during the detecting step using the known intensity variance of the light beam.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">While the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention relates to a light emitting stylus, the position and states of which can be measured by an optical digitizer. Light beam size and shape can be adapted to provide accurate, high resolution location determination using an array of light sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention provides a light emitting stylus useful in a user input device, where the stylus can include one or more of the following features. The present invention provides a stylus that emits a light beam having a spot size that is greater than the distance between neighboring adjacent optical sensors to locate the beam at all locations of interest. The present invention provides a stylus that emits a known, varying intensity profile, such as with a slightly defocused light beam having an intensity profile that is brightest at the center and reduces to zero in a known pattern. In using such a stylus, two or more adjacent optical sensors can detect light in an amount proportional to their proximity to the center of the beam, thus allowing interpolation of the location of the beam center resulting in a greater resolution than would be expected given the distance between optical sensors. The present invention provides a system in which the angle of the light beam, and therefore the angle of the stylus, can be measured using the aspect ratio of the beam shape at the plane of the light sensors in comparison with the known aspect ratio of the beam. This angle, and the location of the center of the beam, can be used to locate the position of the stylus. This may be particularly useful when the digitizer surface is a significant distance from the light sensing surface to account and correct for parallax errors. Knowing the position of the stylus, and thus the user's hand, can also be useful for other purposes such as determining where to display information so that it can be seen by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an input device <b>10</b> that includes a digitizer <b>11</b>, which may include an upper substrate <b>15</b> having an input surface <b>16</b>, a lower substrate <b>18</b>, a photo detector array <b>19</b> including detectors <b>48</b>, and inter-substrate gap <b>17</b>. Digitizer <b>11</b> may also function as a display, for example an active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) where the photo detectors are additionally provided, a liquid crystal display (LCD) where the photo detectors are the pixel transistors of the display, an organic electroluminescent display (OLED) where the light emitting pixels also function as photo detectors, and the like. Examples of digitizers suitable for use in the present invention include those disclosed in the following publications, each of which is wholly incorporated into this document as if reproduced in full: WO 03/071345; WO 03/058588; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,337,918; 5,838,308; JP 10-187348; JP 10-283113; JP 58-086674; JP 60-198630; JP 60-200388; JP 61-006729; JP 61-075423; JP 11-282628; and JP 2003-66417.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows two identical light emitting styli <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, each emitting highly focused laser-like beams <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, respectively. Styli <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are a distance T from array <b>19</b>. Stylus <b>20</b> is perpendicular to array <b>19</b>, and the width of its beam <b>30</b> is sufficient to irradiate at least two photo detectors simultaneously. The location of stylus <b>20</b> can be determined by measuring the position of the spot of light intersecting with detector array <b>19</b> directly below stylus <b>20</b>. Detection of light beam <b>30</b> may be enhanced by modulating beam <b>30</b> so the detected signal can be filtered and separated from ambient light or electronic noise. Light beam <b>30</b> may be modulated by changing color, intensity, duty cycle, polarization, or pulse width modulation without affecting the position measurement. Such beam modulation may also be used to convey states of the stylus, such as the on/off condition of a tip transducer <b>24</b> (e.g., indicating contact of the stylus with the input surface), or side switch <b>23</b>. These states can be communicated via array <b>19</b> to measurement system <b>213</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Uniquely modulated beams from two or more styli may be used to distinguish the styli, for example those used by two or more unique users of a single digitizer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The side switch <b>23</b> and/or the tip transducer <b>24</b> can be pressure activated switches that make or break an electrical contact, resulting in a signal. The signal may be a change in stylus beam <b>30</b>, such as a change in beam intensity, or in the duty cycle of a modulated beam <b>30</b>, or in frequency of modulation of beam <b>30</b>, or the color of beam <b>30</b>, or the polarization of light in beam <b>30</b>. The change in stylus beam <b>30</b> is conveyed via array <b>19</b> to measurement system <b>213</b> where it may be interpreted as the equivalent of a right or left mouse click, or other change in status of stylus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Side switch <b>23</b> may be a capacitive sensing transducer that activates when touch contact is made to the body of stylus <b>20</b> and also to an electrically isolated area, identified as switch <b>23</b>. Tip transducer <b>24</b> may be a pressure sensing transducer that outputs a continuously varying signal in response to varying pressure on tip transducer <b>24</b>. The signal from transducer <b>24</b> can cause a change in stylus beam <b>30</b>, such as a change in beam intensity, or frequency, etc. described above.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Tip transducer <b>24</b> may be a mechanical shutter that passes a variable amount of light from a light source in stylus <b>20</b> to array <b>19</b>, depending on the amount of pressure applied to tip transducer <b>24</b>. Tip transducer <b>24</b> may be a light guide in the form of a movable lens or a tube that focuses or guides light to form a variable width beam from a light source in stylus <b>20</b> to array <b>19</b>, depending on the amount of movement of tip <b>24</b>, resulting from pressure applied to tip transducer <b>24</b>. Width changes of the beam can be measured as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, stylus <b>21</b> and its beam <b>31</b> are identical to stylus <b>20</b> and beam <b>30</b>, except that stylus <b>21</b> is at an angle of Λ degrees with respect to an axis perpendicular to array <b>19</b>. This angle and the distance T between stylus <b>21</b> and array <b>19</b> results in a distance E between the point of contact of stylus <b>21</b> with surface <b>16</b> and the point where light beam <b>31</b> intersects with detector array <b>19</b>. If the location of stylus <b>21</b> were measured as the intersection of beam <b>31</b> and array <b>19</b>, the distance E will represent an error. The error E can be measured and corrected if the angle Λ of stylus beam <b>31</b> can be measured, and the distance T is known (or can be measured).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an overhead view of the array <b>19</b> of photo detectors <b>48</b>, spaced center-to-center at a distance M<sub>D </sub>horizontally and N<sub>D </sub>vertically. As shown, N<sub>D</sub>=M<sub>D</sub>, although this condition need not be the case. The present invention contemplates any array or distribution of light detectors, including linear arrays, hexagonal arrays, rectangular arrays, or any other suitable array or distribution of detectors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is meant to represent a relatively high detector density such as is typical of OLED displays configured for optical sensing, such as disclosed in WO 03/058588, incorporated herein by reference. Also shown are light spots <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> irradiated by stylus beams <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> respectively. A resolution of half the detector array <b>19</b> spacing (in this case M/2), can be achieved if a beam irradiates at least portions of two detectors simultaneously in each of the X and Y directions. Each photo detector in array <b>19</b> measures multiple levels of light, so interpolation of light levels can be used to locate the position of a spot having a diameter greater than 2M diameter to a resolution finer than the inter-detector distance M. In the case where N<sub>D </sub>and M<sub>D </sub>are not equal, it may be desirable for the spot diameter to be about equal to or greater than the larger of N<sub>D </sub>and M<sub>D</sub>. While beam spot <b>40</b> is shown to be round, it will be appreciated that any spot shape can be used, particularly when the spot shape and intensity distribution are known.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Spot <b>41</b> is made by a round beam of light from stylus <b>21</b> that is oriented at an angle of Λ degrees from the plane of detector array <b>19</b>. The resulting spot <b>41</b> is an elliptical shape with minimum width D, equal to the diameter of beam <b>31</b>. The long dimension L of the ellipse is determined by the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>L=D</i>*Cos Λ  (Equation 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
So Λ can be calculated from L and D;
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Λ=Cos<sup>−1 </sup><i>D/L </i>  (Equation 2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A stylus beam angle of 45° results in L=1.41*D. The length to width ratio and orientation of the longer dimension of elliptical spot <b>41</b> can thus be used to measure the tilt angle Λ and tilt axis of stylus <b>21</b>. Given the angle Λ from equation 2 and the known distance T, the magnitude of error E can be calculated by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>E</i>=Tan Λ*<i>T </i>  (Equation 3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The magnitude of error E can be calculated from Equation 3. The long axis L of elliptical spot <b>42</b>, and therefore error E, can be determined directly from sensor array <b>19</b> measurements and simple image recognition algorithms. The direction of error E, however, cannot be determined from direct, static measurement. For example, spot <b>41</b> may result from a stylus <b>21</b> at position Q, or at position W. The actual stylus position can be determined by applying one or more of several methods, examples of which are outlined below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Stylus <b>21</b> will typically be hand held, and thus the tilt angle Λ of stylus <b>21</b> will typically be in the direction of the hand or fingers holding the stylus. Since the user and hand are typically oriented toward the bottom of digitizer array <b>19</b>, it may be assumed that the hand, and (generally) stylus <b>21</b> are located nearer to point W than to point Q. This method may be adequate in systems where the orientation of the input device with respect to a user will always be known.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Since digitizer array <b>19</b> senses light, hand position may be determined by measuring the shadow <b>47</b> cast by stylus <b>21</b> and the hand or fingers, relative to light spot <b>31</b>. A shadow <b>49</b> to the right of spot <b>31</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), indicates that stylus <b>21</b> is located nearer to point W than to point Q. This method may be adequate in systems where there is sufficient ambient light to cast a shadow from the stylus or the hand.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is also possible to infer the hand location based on spot movements. In normal writing, few strokes (especially straight strikes) are made by pushing the stylus in the direction it is pointing. Most strokes will be made sideways or by pulling the stylus tip in the direction the stylus is tilted. Thus, a recent history of relative beam locations can be used to determine hand position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A further method includes prompting the user to indicate hand position and/or device orientation prior to user inputs being made.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A further method of determining stylus orientation includes additional analysis of the light distribution of the spot formed on the detectors. Without loss of generality, in the case in which a light beam having a know cross-sectional intensity distribution, such as a Gaussian light distribution or a conical light distribution, illuminates the sensor array at an angle, an elliptical spot will be formed such as spot <b>41</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (and, analogously, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> with respect to spots <b>141</b> and <b>341</b>, respectively). The elliptical spot will generally exhibit an intensity distribution such that the half of the spot oriented toward the stylus tilt direction will have a higher integrated intensity than the half of the spot oriented away from the stylus tilt direction. As such, comparing the integrated intensity contribution from different halves, quadrants, or other selected sections of the spot can be used to indicate stylus tilt direction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to aiding positional error corrections, hand and stylus position information can be used for other purposes. For example, when popping up a menu or other information on the display, it may be desirable to position the information where its viewing is unlikely to be blocked by the stylus or hand. As another example, in multiple user systems, the determined position and orientation of the stylus can be used to determine which user is inputting the information.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an input device <b>110</b> similar to device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that styli <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> emit conical beams, spreading light in spot patterns over a wider area. Also, sensor array <b>119</b> has fewer detectors <b>148</b> that are more widely spaced, as may be the case where the photo detectors <b>148</b> are part of a photo-sensitive LCD, as disclosed in International Publication WO 03/071345, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In a sparse array such as <b>119</b>, a wider beam with a known varying intensity across its axis has advantages as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) can be used to demonstrate various representative beam intensity profiles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) shows chart <b>100</b>, with light distributions of several light beams shown. The distribution of radiant intensity around a light source (e.g. an LED) is referred to as the beam angle Φ. The maximum radiant intensity is on the optical axis. This is generally reduced as the angle Φ to the optical axis increases. The range of the optical angle within which the radiant intensity is greater than or equal to 50% of the maximum value is referred to as the half intensity value.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to graph <b>100</b>, line <b>101</b> results from a sharply focused laser-like beam with a half intensity angle near zero. Line <b>102</b> is typical of an unfocused, planar type LED, with a half intensity angle of +/−60°. Line <b>103</b> may be achieved with a parabolic lens on an LED, resulting in a half intensity angle of +/−25°. Graph <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) shows another view of line <b>103</b>, the relative radiant intensity of a light source with half intensity angle of 25°. Such a known beam intensity profile can be used as described in discussions that follow.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, consider that the beam of stylus <b>120</b> has the radiant versus angle as indicated by profile <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). This results in light distribution onto array <b>119</b> that varies with distance from a maximum light at the beam <b>130</b> center, reducing with distance from the center in a known way. When used with a sparse array such as array <b>119</b>, this light distribution has several advantages over highly focused beams <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Because the intersection of beam <b>130</b> with array <b>119</b> is wider, the light irradiates several detectors <b>148</b> even though their spacing is wide. The light distribution has a defined pattern, which may be used to more accurately interpolate between widely-spaced detectors <b>148</b>. Also, changes in distance between stylus <b>120</b> and array <b>119</b> will result in a change in width of the intersection of beam <b>130</b> and array <b>119</b> that may be detected. This may allow stylus <b>120</b> height (distance from array <b>119</b>) to be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a top view of array <b>119</b> and light spots <b>140</b> and <b>141</b> irradiated by stylus beams <b>130</b> and <b>131</b>, respectively. Inter-detector spaces are M<sub>S </sub>horizontally and N<sub>S </sub>vertically, where M<sub>S</sub>=N<sub>S</sub>. G represents the width of the minimum gap between adjacent photo detectors <b>148</b>. Spot <b>42</b> is an example of a spot that might be made by a small diameter, more sharply focused laser-like beam. If spot <b>42</b> diameter is less than or equal to the inter-detector gap G (as shown), it can be located by detectors in array <b>119</b> with a resolution determined by the inter-detector distance M. If spot <b>42</b> diameter is greater than the inter-detector gap G, it can be measured simultaneously by two detectors <b>140</b>, and interpolation can be used to locate spot <b>42</b> with a resolution of M/2. The inter-detector spacing M of sparse array <b>119</b> may be greater than 1 mm, so a resolution of M/2 would be marginal for some stylus applications such as writing. Therefore a wider, variable-intensity spot like <b>140</b> can be generated so interpolation can be used more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, consider spot <b>140</b> having a light distribution as defined by profile <b>103</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), and spot <b>140</b> is centered half way between detectors <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>. Given M=N=1 mm, and T=3 mm, detectors <b>142</b> and <b>143</b> will receive about 0.94 of the maximum light transmitted to the plane of the detectors. Detectors <b>144</b> and <b>145</b> will receive about 0.66 of maximum, or 70% as much as detectors <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>. Detectors <b>146</b> and <b>147</b> will receive virtually no light. These light intensities and intensity differences among adjacent detectors allow high resolution interpolation between the detectors in that the beam intensity profile and overall shape are known and can be compared to the detected signals. The detected signals can be mapped onto the known profile and shape to pinpoint the location of the center of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Elliptical spot <b>141</b> results from stylus <b>121</b>, at an angle Λ<b>2</b> with respect to array <b>119</b>. Length to width ratios can be used to calculate the orientation and angle of stylus <b>121</b>, and the error E<b>2</b>, using methods similar to those described above in terms of stylus <b>21</b> and elliptical spot <b>41</b>. Error E<b>2</b> may also be further analyzed. A beam with light distribution as defined by profile <b>103</b> will distribute light with half of total irradiation on either side of the optical axis (and stylus axis). The irradiation falling in the direction of stylus tilt will fall in a smaller area that spans length E<b>2</b>, while the irradiation on other side of the optical axis will cover a larger area. The total illumination in the region of spot <b>141</b> collected by detectors <b>148</b> may be analyzed to determine the location of the optical axis, based on a 50%/50% distribution. Alternatively, the optical axis may be located by comparing the measured light distribution of spot <b>141</b> versus the known light distribution profile (e.g., profile <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an input device <b>310</b> including digitizer <b>311</b>. Two identical light emitting styli <b>320</b> and <b>321</b> are also shown, each emitting focused beams <b>330</b> and <b>331</b> with an annular beam pattern. Stylus <b>320</b> is shown in cross section, showing internal light source <b>335</b>, and the cross section of tubular shaped light guide <b>336</b>, which carries light from source <b>335</b> through tip <b>324</b>, focusing it into an annular pattern of light. Stylus <b>321</b> projects a similar light pattern at an angle Λ<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an overhead view of array <b>319</b> of photo detectors <b>348</b>. Also shown are ring shaped light spots <b>340</b> and <b>341</b> irradiated by stylus beams <b>330</b> and <b>331</b>, respectively. The ring-shaped spot <b>340</b> has the advantage that it can be formed of a relatively highly focused beam while exhibiting high contrast in light level, and thus in signal, between adjacent detectors. This contrast can be detected on both the inner and outer edges of the ring. For example, detector <b>350</b> will detect low light, while the eight nearest neighbor detectors adjacent to <b>350</b> will detect higher light levels, and the next group of detectors outward from the eight detectors will detect low light. Image detection algorithms can be used to resolve the stylus location with high resolution. The height of stylus <b>330</b> may also be measured using a ratio of ring diameter to center (unlit) diameter. The tilt angle and axis of elliptical ring shaped spot <b>341</b> can be determined as described above for spot <b>41</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hand shadow <b>349</b> and stylus shadow <b>347</b> can be used to determine the tilt angle Λ of stylus <b>321</b>. In situations where spot contrast is low, shadows <b>349</b> and <b>347</b> can also be used in conjunction with spot <b>341</b> to locate the stylus.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The spot intensity profiles shown and discussed are illustrative and not meant to be limiting. Other known, varied spot intensity profiles can be used in addition to those shown in the drawings, and are fully contemplated for use with the present invention as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art from the description provided in this document. The techniques for spot location determination and enhanced resolution, beam angle determination, stylus orientation determination, and so forth, as described are directly applicable to any spot intensity profile having characteristics detectable by light sensor arrays useful in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a block diagram of a display system with a photo detector array. Generally, the display pixel array <b>210</b> and the photo detector array <b>212</b> are co-located as described in published U.S. Patent Application US 2003/0122749 and in International Publication WO 03/071345, each of which is hereby incorporated into this document as if reproduced in full. Pixel drivers <b>211</b> and the photo detector measurement system <b>213</b> may also be integrated into the same semiconductor device(s), and may be in communication with system controller <b>218</b>. Display pixel drivers <b>211</b> are known in the art. Photo detector measurement system <b>213</b> can measure the amount of light irradiating each detector in display pixel array <b>210</b>. It may also be able to measure ambient light and to discriminate between ambient light and shadows. A system controller calculates display information to be sent to pixel drivers <b>211</b>, and also calculates the position of light patterns on photo detector array <b>212</b>, measured by photo detector measurement system <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a cross sectional view of system <b>410</b> with digitizer <b>411</b> having detector array <b>419</b>. Each detector <b>448</b> in array <b>419</b> has an associated lens, for example lenses <b>452</b>, <b>453</b>, <b>454</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>456</b>, and <b>457</b>, in its optical path. A similar lens arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,581, which is incorporated by reference herein. Lenses <b>452</b> through <b>457</b> focus light from above digitizer <b>411</b> such that each detector in array <b>419</b> receives light nominally perpendicular to array <b>419</b>, through a column equal in diameter to lenses <b>452</b> through <b>457</b>. Light <b>431</b> from stylus <b>421</b> is spread in a wide angle, for example 170 degrees, so it is spread across many detectors, and may strike the detectors at various angles as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Lenses <b>452</b> through <b>457</b> convey perpendicular light to their respective detectors, so only the light impinging on lenses <b>455</b> and <b>456</b> would be focused onto any detectors. Thus, the error E<b>4</b> between the tip location of stylus <b>421</b> and the center of its emitted light spot, due to angle Λ<b>4</b> of the stylus, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A lens above each detector in array <b>419</b> can also increase the contrast of light and shadows received by detectors in array <b>419</b>, because light impinging on surface <b>416</b> of digitizer <b>411</b> at oblique angles will be refracted by the lenses away from detectors in array <b>419</b>. This is particularly important where shadows, such as those cast by the stylus or hand as described in this document, are used to locate stylus and/or touch positions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present invention should not be considered limited to the particular examples described above, but rather should be understood to cover all aspects of the invention as fairly set out in the attached claims. Various modifications, equivalent processes, as well as numerous structures to which the present invention may be applicable will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art to which the present invention is directed upon review of the instant specification.</p>
