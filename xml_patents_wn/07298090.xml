<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a light assembly, and more particularly to a light assembly having a light control or changing device or structure for controlling or actuating the light assembly to generate various light colors and/or to generate various light flashing or emitting modes or processes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical light devices comprise one or more light bulbs or light emitting diodes energized by one or more batteries and controlled by one or more switches for controlling or actuating the light device to generate indicating or warning lights.</p>
