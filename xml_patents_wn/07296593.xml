<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Heretofore, a pilot-controlled switching valve assembly has been known which comprises a main valve and a pilot valve for opening and closing the main valve, and various types of pilot-controlled switching valve assemblies have been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fundamentally, all types of pilot-controlled switching valve are provided with (1) a manual operation member, such as a button, (2) a pilot valve movable in conjunction with the manual operation member, (3) a main valve and a pressure chamber disposed on the side of a back surface of the main valve, and designed to open the main valve in response to releasing a primary pressure in the pressure chamber by use of the pilot valve.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A specific structure of the conventional pilot-controlled switching valve assembly will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a schematic diagram showing one example of the conventional pilot-controlled switching valve assembly, which is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication No. 09-060969 (Patent Publication 1).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, this type of pilot-controlled switching valve assembly comprises a manual operation member <b>100</b> to be pressed by a push button or the like, a push rod <b>102</b> having a base end connected integrally or directly to the manual operation member, a pilot valve <b>104</b> provided at a distal end of the push rod <b>102</b>, a diaphragm main valve <b>108</b> having a pilot-valve port <b>106</b> designed such that the pilot valve <b>104</b> is selectively brought into contact therewith and separated therefrom, a housing <b>112</b> defining a pressure chamber <b>110</b> formed on the side of the back surface of the main valve <b>110</b>, and a valve seat <b>114</b> designed such that a front surface of the main valve <b>110</b> is selectively seated thereon and unseated therefrom. The pilot-controlled switching valve assembly also includes a sealing member <b>116</b> disposed at a portion of the housing <b>112</b> allowing the push rod <b>102</b> to penetrate therethrough, and a small hole <b>118</b> formed in a peripheral portion of the main valve <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a schematic diagram showing another example of the conventional pilot-controlled switching valve assembly, which is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Nos. 11-304245 (Patent Publication 2) and 2001-098596 (Patent Publication 3).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, this type of pilot-controlled switching valve assembly has the same fundamental structure as that of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, and additionally includes a buffer mechanism (coil spring) <b>120</b> interposed between the manual operation member <b>100</b> and the base end of the push rod <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Publication 1: Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication No. 09-060969</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Publication 2: Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication No. 11-304245</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Patent Publication 3: Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication No. 2001-098596</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The aforementioned conventional pilot-controlled switching valve assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is designed such that the pilot valve <b>104</b> disposed within the pressure chamber <b>110</b> is brought in contact with and separated from the pilot-valve port <b>106</b> of the main valve <b>108</b>, so that the pilot valve <b>104</b> is opened and closed to switch between water-stop and water-discharge states.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, in an operation for switching from the water-discharge state to the water-stop state, it is firstly required that the pilot valve <b>104</b> be pressed through the push rod <b>102</b> in a direction allowing the pilot valve <b>104</b> to be brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>106</b>. During this process, while the push rod <b>102</b> and the pilot valve <b>104</b> receive an upward force from a water pressure in the pressure chamber <b>110</b> and thereby the manual operation member <b>100</b> has to be pressed against the upward force, this required force is a very small value.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Then, when the pilot valve <b>104</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>106</b> of the main valve <b>108</b>, a water pressure is acting on the main valve <b>108</b> in a direction allowing the main valve <b>108</b> to be moved away from the valve seat <b>114</b>, and thereby the water-stopping operation has to be performed by use of a sufficient force against this water pressure. During this process, while the main valve <b>108</b> is moved toward the valve seat <b>114</b>, this movement is performed at a low speed, which means that the pilot valve <b>104</b> forcibly presses the main valve <b>108</b> toward the valve seat <b>114</b>. This forcible pressing of the main valve <b>108</b> toward the valve seat <b>114</b> causes the occurrence of water hammer when the main valve <b>108</b> is brought into contact with the valve seat <b>114</b>, which leads to deterioration in operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">During the water-stopping operation, the conventional valve assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> has the difference (unevenness) in operational force between (1) before the pilot valve <b>104</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>106</b> and (2) after the pilot valve <b>104</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>106</b>, resulting in undesirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pilot-controlled switching valve assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is provided with the buffer mechanism <b>120</b> interposed between the manual operation member <b>100</b> and the base end of the pilot valve <b>104</b> to absorb a moving distance (displacement) of the pilot valve <b>104</b> in its stroke direction so as to provide improved operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, in this type of pilot-controlled switching valve assembly, a spring load onto the buffer mechanism <b>118</b> cannot be set at a low value, and thereby a spring constant of the buffer mechanism <b>118</b> cannot be set at a small value. Thus, the addition of the buffer mechanism <b>118</b> cannot contribute to improvement in operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Specifically, when the pilot valve <b>104</b> disposed within the pressure chamber <b>110</b> is externally operated, the bottom surface of the pilot valve <b>104</b> is subjected to a water pressure for an area equivalent to the cross-sectional area of the push rod <b>102</b>, and this water pressure acts on the push rod <b>102</b> (pilot valve <b>104</b>) to move it away from the pilot-valve port <b>106</b>. Therefore, a spring load on the buffer mechanism <b>120</b> has to be set at a value equal to or greater than the water pressure (if this is not done, the pilot valve <b>104</b> cannot be brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Consequently, it is difficult to downsize the buffer mechanism <b>120</b> in the conventional valve assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Moreover, during the water-stopping operation, this type of conventional valve assembly still has the difference (unevenness) in operational force between (1) before the pilot valve <b>104</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>106</b> and (2) after the pilot valve <b>104</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>106</b>, resulting in an undesirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When a mixing faucet using a push button is developed, it is required to employ a pilot-controlled switching valve assembly as described above, but the conventional pilot-controlled switching valve assemblies involve the above problems. Thus, there is a need to be solve these problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In view of the aforementioned problems in the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a switching valve assembly capable of eliminating the unevenness in operational force to obtain a desirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is another object of the present invention to provide a switching valve assembly capable of facilitating downsizing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a switching valve assembly for use in a mixing faucet operable to mix hot water and cold water at a desired temperature and selectively stop and discharge the mixed water. The switching valve assembly comprises a manual operation member adapted to be moved in response to a pressing operation by a user, a push rod member having a base end joined to the manual operation member, a pilot valve disposed relative to a distal end of the push rod member, a buffer device interposed between the pilot valve and the distal end of the push rod member, a diaphragm main valve having a pilot-valve port designed such that the pilot valve is selectively brought into contact therewith and separated therefrom, a pressure chamber formed on the side of a back surface of the main valve to contain a part of the push rod member, the pilot valve and the buffer device, and a valve seat designed such that a front surface of the main valve is selectively seated thereon and unseated therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the above switching valve assembly of the present invention, when a water-discharge state is switched to a water-stop state, the push rod member is firstly pressed to bring the pilot valve into contact with the pilot-valve port. During this process, while the push rod member receives an upward force from a water pressure acting on the distal end thereof for an area equivalent to its cross-sectional area and thereby the manual operation member has to be pressed against the upward force, this required force (operational force) is small. Then, after the pilot valve is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port of the main valve, the main valve is moved toward the valve seat and seated on the valve seat so that the water-discharge state is switched to the water-stop state. The buffer device disposed within the pressure chamber makes it possible for no force to act thereon before the pilot valve is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port, and only a small force (operational force) may be applied thereto even after the pilot valve is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port. Thus, according to the present invention, the difference (unevenness) in operational force which would otherwise occur between (1) before the pilot valve is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port and (2) after the pilot valve is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port, can be eliminated during a water-stopping operation, to obtain a desirable operational feeling. In addition, a spring load on the buffer device can be set at a low value, and thereby a spring constant thereof can be set at a small value to facilitate downsizing of the switching valve assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the present invention, it is preferable that the buffer device be a coil spring having a spring constant of 0.01 to 2 N/mm.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the difference (unevenness) in operational force can be effectively eliminated to obtain a desirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">More preferably, the buffer device is a coil spring having a spring constant of 0.01 to 0.75 N/mm.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the difference (unevenness) in operational force can be eliminated more effectively to obtain a more desirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present invention, it is preferable that the buffer device be a coil spring having a spring constant of 0.01 to P<sub>1</sub>d<sup>2</sup>π/(4δ)N/mm, wherein δ is the amount of deflection (mm) of the coil spring, P<sub>1 </sub>is a water pressure (MPa), and d is the diameter (mm) of a rod portion of the push rod member.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the difference (unevenness) in operational force can be eliminated more effectively to obtain a more desirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present invention, it is preferable that the push rod member be formed to have a smaller diameter than that of the pilot-valve port.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the push rod member formed to have a smaller diameter than that of the pilot-valve port allows an operational force of the manual operation member to be reduced so as to assure a reliable water-stopping performance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present invention, it is preferable that the push rod member be made of stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, even if the push rod member has a small diameter, it can have a sufficient corrosion resistance during use in water to obtain enhanced reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the switching valve assembly of the present invention further includes a pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism operable to selectively switch the pilot valve between a water-stop position and a water-discharge position in conjunction with the movement of the manual operation member and hold the pilot valve in either one of the water-stop position and the water-discharge position, and the pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism has a heart cam structure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism having a heart cam structure allows the push rod member to be moved in a reciprocating motion (up-and-down motion) so that a load on a sealing member is reduced to obtain enhanced reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present invention, it is preferable that the mixing faucet comprises a faucet body, a faucet push button for discharging the mixed water directly from a faucet, and a shower push button for discharging the mixed water from a shower, and each of the faucet and shower push buttons has a biasing device adapted to press the push button downward when the push button is located in a water-discharge position and above a top surface of the faucet body.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the user performs a water-discharging operation for switching from the water-stop state to the water-discharge state, each of the faucet and shower push buttons is pressed downward by the biasing device so as to prevent the push button itself from being abnormally moved (vibrated).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present invention also provides a switching valve assembly comprising a manual operation member adapted to be moved in response to a pressing operation by a user, a push rod member having a base end joined to the manual operation member, a pilot valve disposed relative to a distal end of the push rod member, a buffer device interposed between the pilot valve and the distal end of the push rod member, a diaphragm main valve having a pilot-valve port designed such that the pilot valve is selectively brought into contact therewith and separated therefrom, a pressure chamber formed on the side of a back surface of the main valve to contain a part of the push rod member, the pilot valve and the buffer device, and a valve seat designed such that a front surface of the main valve is selectively seated thereon and unseated therefrom.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to accompanying drawings, an embodiment of the present invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Firstly, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7(</figref><i>b</i>), a pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described. This assembly is applied to a mixing faucet.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a general perspective view showing the mixing faucet to which the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to the first embodiment of the present invention is to be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mixing faucet indicated by the reference numeral <b>1</b> is attached onto a wall surface <b>2</b>, which is an installation surface of the mixing faucet <b>1</b>, in such a manner as to protrude therefrom. The mixing faucet <b>1</b> comprises a plate-shaped heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> which is a part of a faucet body. The mixing faucet <b>1</b> further includes a temperature-adjusting dial <b>6</b>, a faucet push button <b>8</b> for discharging mixed water from a faucet, and a shower push button <b>10</b> for discharging the mixed water from a shower, which are individually attached to the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>. The mixing faucet <b>1</b> has a bottom surface covered by another heat-insulating cover <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The mixing faucet <b>1</b> is operable, in response to setting a desired water temperature by use of the temperature-adjusting dial <b>6</b>, to adjust a mixing ratio between hot water and cold water so as to allow the mixed water to be discharged at the desired temperature. In this case, the mixed water can be discharged from the faucet by operating the faucet push button <b>8</b>, or discharged from the shower by operating the shower push button <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this example, the shower push button <b>10</b> is formed to have a larger size than that of the faucet push button <b>8</b> to provide enhanced operationality for users.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, the faucet push button <b>8</b> and the shower push button <b>10</b> are disposed at a position closer to a user as compared to the temperature-adjusting dial <b>6</b> to provide enhanced operationality.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Each of the faucet push button <b>8</b> and the shower push button <b>10</b> also has an operational surface disposed to be approximately flush with a top surface of the plate-shaped heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> to provide enhanced operationality.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, each operational surface of the faucet push button <b>8</b> and the shower push button <b>10</b> is provided with an anti-slip means <b>14</b>, such as irregularities.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A faucet-water outlet <b>16</b> and a shower-water outlet <b>18</b> are disposed in the vicinity of a frontward portion of the bottom surface of the mixing faucet <b>1</b>. A shower hose <b>20</b> in fluid communication with a showerhead (not shown) is connected to the shower-water outlet <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The mixing faucet <b>1</b> has right and left side surfaces each provided with an adjusting device for a water shutoff valve <b>22</b> and a maintenance hole for a filter and a check valve <b>24</b>, parts of the valve <b>22</b> and the hole being also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The adjusting device and the maintenance hole in the right side surface are used for supplying cold water to the mixed faucet <b>1</b>, and the adjusting device and the maintenance hole in the left side surface are used for supplying hot water to the mixed faucet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">One side surface of the mixing faucet <b>1</b> to be fixed to the wall surface is formed with a pair of connection portions designed such that a cold-water supply pipe <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a hot-water supply pipe are connected thereto, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A user can set a desired temperature using the temperature-adjusting dial <b>6</b>, and then push the faucet push button <b>8</b> when the user wants to obtain feed water from the faucet or push the shower push button <b>10</b> when the user wants to obtain feed water from the shower, so as to immediately obtain the feeding of the mixed water at the desired temperature. Then, the user can re-push the push buttons <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> to stop the mixed water.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The flows of cold water and hot water in the mixing faucet <b>1</b> during the above operation will be described below. Each of the flow volumes of cold water and hot water supplied, respectively, from the cold-water supply pipe <b>26</b> and the hot-water supply pipe (not shown) into the mixing faucet <b>1</b> is reduced to an appropriate value by a corresponding one of the shutoff valves <b>22</b> for cold water and hot water. Then, each of the adjusted cold water and hot water passes through corresponding ones of the filters and check valves <b>24</b> for cold water and hot water, and flows into a temperature control valve, which is a thermostat-type hot/cold water mixing valve. The cold water and hot water are automatically adjusted through the temperature control valve to have the desired temperature, and the mixed water flows out of the temperature control valve. Then, the mixed water is discharged from one or both of the faucet and the shower through a corresponding one or both of after-mentioned two switching valve units (pilot-controlled switching valve assemblies) <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, which are provided, respectively, for the faucet and the shower (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows only the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly <b>32</b>).</p>

Each of the switching value units <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> is attached to the body of the mixing faucet <b>1</b> with a switching-valve-unit attaching nut <b>34</b>. This switching-valve-unit attaching nut <b>34</b> has a top end formed with an extension <b>34</b><i>a </i>to prevent water from getting into each of the switching value unit <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The faucet switching valve unit <b>30</b> and the shower switching valve unit <b>32</b> have the same structure, and thus the following description will be given only about the shower switching valve unit <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Before the detailed description about the structure of the switching valve unit <b>32</b> is given, the fundamental structure of the switching valve unit (pilot-controlled switching valve assembly) according to the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the switching valve unit <b>32</b> assembly comprises a manual operation member <b>34</b> adapted to be moved in response to a pressing operation in which a user presses the shower push button <b>10</b>, a push rod <b>38</b> having a base end joined to the manual operation member <b>36</b>, and a pilot valve <b>38</b> disposed relative to a distal end of the push rod <b>38</b>, wherein a coil spring <b>42</b> serving as a buffer device is interposed between a pilot valve <b>40</b> and the distal end (lower end) of the push rod <b>38</b>. The switching valve unit <b>32</b> further includes a diaphragm main valve <b>46</b> having a pilot-valve port (pressure release hole) <b>44</b> designed such that the pilot valve <b>40</b> is selectively brought into contact therewith and separated therefrom, a housing <b>50</b> defining a pressure chamber <b>48</b> which is formed on the side of a back surface of the main valve <b>46</b> to contain a part of the push rod <b>38</b>, the pilot valve <b>40</b> and the coil spring <b>42</b>, a valve seat <b>52</b> designed such that a front surface of the main valve <b>46</b> is selectively seated thereon and unseated therefrom, a sealing member <b>54</b> at a portion of the housing <b>50</b> allowing the push rod <b>39</b> to penetrate therethrough, and a small hole (primary-pressure inlet port) <b>56</b> formed in a peripheral portion of the main valve <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A fundamental operation for the switching valve unit <b>32</b> will be described below. This switching valve unit <b>32</b> is designed such that the pilot valve <b>40</b> disposed within the pressure chamber <b>48</b> is brought in contact with and separated from the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> of the main valve <b>46</b>, so that the pilot valve <b>40</b> is opened and closed to switch between water-stop and water-discharge states.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, in an operation for switching from the water-discharge state to the water-stop state, it is firstly required that the pilot valve <b>44</b> be pressed by the push rod <b>38</b> in a direction allowing the pilot valve <b>44</b> to be brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>. During this process, while the push rod <b>38</b> receives an upward force from a water pressure acting on the distal end thereof for an area equivalent to its cross-sectional area, and a sliding frictional resistance from the sealing member <b>54</b>, and thereby the manual operation member <b>36</b> has to be pressed against the force and resistance, this required force (operational force) is a small value.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Then, when the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> of the main valve <b>46</b>, water having a primary pressure in a primary water passage flows into the pressure chamber <b>48</b> through the small hole <b>56</b>, and the main valve <b>46</b> is moved toward the valve seat <b>52</b> at a low speed according to the inflow of the water. Through the above process, the main valve <b>46</b> is seated on the valve seat <b>52</b> so that the water-discharge state is switched to the water-stop state.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the first embodiment, the coil spring <b>42</b> serving as a buffer device is disposed between the push rod <b>38</b> and the pilot valve <b>40</b>, or within the pressure chamber <b>48</b>. Thus, no force acts on the coil spring <b>42</b> before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, and only a small force may be applied thereto even after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, as described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an operation for switching from the water-stop state to the water-discharge state, when the manual operation member <b>36</b> is pressed, the pilot valve <b>40</b> is separated from the pilot-valve port (pressure release hole) <b>44</b> by means of an after-mentioned pilot-valve holding/switching mechanism <b>62</b> and biasing spring <b>68</b>. Thus, the pressure chamber <b>48</b> is opened, and the main valve <b>46</b> is unseated from the valve seat <b>52</b>, so that the water-stop state is switched to the water-discharge state (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, in the switching valve unit <b>32</b> according to the first embodiment, the moving speed of the main valve <b>46</b> is intentionally reduced. This reduction is done to prevent a water hammer phenomenon from occurring when the main valve <b>46</b> is closed. Specifically, when the primary water flows into the pressure chamber <b>48</b> through the small hole <b>56</b> formed in the main valve <b>46</b>, and the pressure chamber <b>110</b> is filled with the primary water, the main valve <b>46</b> is moved toward the valve seat <b>52</b>. However, the small hole <b>56</b> is typically set to have a very small diameter to reduce an inflow speed of water flowing into the pressure chamber <b>48</b>, whereby the moving speed (closing speed) of the main valve <b>46</b> is reduced to prevent a water hammer phenomenon from occurring when the main valve <b>46</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, the structure of the switching valve unit (pilot-controlled switching valve assembly) <b>32</b> will be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view showing the switching valve unit (pilot-controlled switching valve assembly) according to the first embodiment, wherein the switching valve unit is in a water-stop state (closed state). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view showing the switching valve unit (pilot-controlled switching valve assembly) according to the first embodiment, wherein the switching valve unit is in a water-discharge state (open state). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded diagram showing components of the switching valve unit (pilot-controlled switching valve assembly) according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the switching valve unit <b>32</b> comprises the manual operation member <b>36</b>, the push rod <b>38</b>, the pilot valve <b>40</b>, the coil spring <b>42</b> serving as a buffer device, and the diaphragm main valve <b>46</b> having the pilot-valve port (pressure release hole) <b>44</b>, the housing <b>50</b> (<b>50</b><i>a, </i><b>50</b><i>b</i>) defining the pressure chamber <b>48</b>, the valve seat <b>52</b>, the sealing member <b>54</b> and the small hole <b>56</b>, which have already been described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, a cleaning pin <b>58</b> is inserted into the above small hole (primary-pressure inlet port) <b>56</b> to narrow the cross-sectional area of the primary-pressure inlet port of the small hole <b>56</b>. This allows the inflow speed of the primary pressure into the pressure chamber to be reduced so as to provide a lowered closing speed of the main valve <b>46</b> to prevent a water hammer phenomenon from occurring when the main valve <b>46</b> is closed, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The housing <b>50</b> defining the pressure chamber <b>48</b> comprises a first housing <b>50</b><i>a </i>surrounding a space in which the pilot valve <b>40</b> is primarily disposed, and a second housing <b>50</b><i>b </i>surrounding a space on the side of the back surface of the main valve <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The switching valve unit <b>32</b> also includes an assembling nut <b>60</b> disposed around the outermost periphery thereof to assemble four components, namely the manual operation member <b>36</b>, the first housing <b>50</b><i>a, </i>the second housing <b>50</b><i>b </i>and the valve seat <b>52</b>, so as to make up the switching valve unit <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The switching valve unit <b>32</b> further includes a pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b>. This pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b> is designed to be moved in conjunction with the aforementioned faucet push button <b>8</b> and the shower push button <b>10</b>, and have functions for repeatedly switching the pilot valve <b>40</b> between a water-stop position corresponding to the water-stop state and a water-discharge position corresponding to the water-discharge state, every time either one or both of the push buttons <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> is pressed or every time the manual operation member <b>36</b> is pressed, and holding the pilot valve <b>40</b> in either one of the water-stop position and the water-discharge position.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">While this pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b> may be a mechanism to be commonly used for a knock mechanism for knock-type ballpoint pens, the first embodiment employs a heart cam mechanism comprising a pin <b>64</b> adapted to be moved in conjunction with the manual operation member <b>36</b>, an inverted heart-shaped cam groove <b>66</b> formed in the outer peripheral surface of the first housing <b>50</b><i>a </i>to allow the lower portion of the pin <b>64</b> to be moved therealong while being elastically deformed, and a holding protrusion <b>68</b> adapted to hold the pin <b>64</b> in the water-stop state (closed state), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b> consisting of the heart cam mechanism allows only a reciprocating motion (up-and-down motion) of the push rod <b>38</b> to act on the sealing member <b>54</b> sealing the pressure chamber <b>48</b> without a rotational motion of the push rod <b>38</b> as in the above knock mechanism. Thus, the load on the sealing member <b>54</b> is reduced to obtain enhanced reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The reference numeral <b>69</b> indicates a biasing spring. When one of the push buttons <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> is pressed in the operation for switching from the water-stop state to the water-discharge state, and the manual operation member <b>36</b> is released from the holding in the water-stop position by the pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b> so as to allow the pilot valve <b>40</b> to be separated from the valve seat <b>52</b>, the biasing spring <b>69</b> biases or urges the manual operation member <b>36</b> to move upward so as to facilitate the switching to the water-discharge state.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The structure of an interconnection portion between the push rod <b>38</b> and the pilot valve <b>40</b> will be described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the coil spring <b>42</b> serving as a buffer device for absorbing the moving distance (displacement) of the push rod <b>38</b> in its stroke direction is disposed at the distal end (lower end) of the push rod <b>38</b> and within the pressure chamber <b>48</b>, as described above. The distal end (lower end) of the push rod <b>38</b> is formed as a large diameter portion <b>38</b><i>a, </i>and the top end of the pilot valve <b>40</b> has a packing <b>40</b><i>a </i>attached thereto. The pilot valve <b>40</b> has a hollow portion <b>40</b><i>b, </i>and the coil spring <b>42</b> is contained in the hollow portion <b>40</b><i>b. </i>The pilot valve <b>40</b> has a top wall formed with an insertion hole <b>40</b><i>c </i>allowing the push rod <b>38</b> to be slidably inserted thereinto. The pilot valve <b>40</b> is made of an elastically deformable resin material. Thus, during assembling, the push rod <b>38</b> is inserted into the insertion hole <b>40</b><i>c </i>while deforming the pilot valve <b>40</b> so as to allow the large diameter portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>to be contained in the hollow portion <b>40</b><i>b. </i>In this state, the coil spring <b>42</b> acts on the push rod <b>38</b> and the pilot valve <b>40</b> in a direction allowing them to move away from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Thus, in the water-discharging operation for switching from the water-stop state to the water-discharge state, the large diameter portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>at the distal end of the push rod <b>38</b> is brought into engagement with the top wall of the pilot valve <b>40</b> by the biasing force of the coil spring <b>42</b>, and thereby the pilot valve <b>40</b> is moved in conjunction with the movement of the push rod <b>38</b> and unseated from the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> formed in the main valve <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the water-stopping operation for switching from the water-discharge state to the water-stop state, when the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> formed in the main valve <b>46</b>, the large diameter portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>of the push rod <b>38</b> is separated from the top wall of the pilot valve <b>40</b> and moved downward. During this process, the moving distance (displacement) of the push rod <b>30</b> in its stroke direction is absorbed by the coil spring <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, during the water-stopping operation, the difference (unevenness) in operational force which would otherwise occur between (1) before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> and (2) after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, can be eliminated to obtain a desirable operational feeling, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the switching valve unit <b>32</b> according to the first embodiment, when the operational force of the manual operation member <b>36</b> is to be reduced, it is desirable to minimize the diameter of the push rod <b>38</b>, because the push rod <b>38</b> receives an upward force from a water pressure in the pressure chamber <b>48</b> (water pressure to the distal end of the push rod <b>38</b> for an area equivalent to its cross-sectional area). For example, the push rod <b>38</b> may be formed to have a smaller diameter than that of the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> of the main valve <b>46</b>. This makes it possible to reduce the operational force (pressing force) even under a high-pressure condition, and assure a reliable water-stopping performance.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, when the pilot valve <b>40</b> is in the water-stop position, or seated on the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, the primary pressure acts on the pilot valve <b>40</b> in a direction allowing the pilot valve <b>40</b> to be seated on the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> so that the water-stopping performance is further assured.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the first embodiment, the push rod <b>38</b> is made of stainless steel. Thus, even if the push rod <b>38</b> is designed to have a small diameter, it can have a sufficient corrosion resistance during use in water to obtain enhanced reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As compared to the conventional example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly (switching valve unit) according to the first embodiment can reduce a load acting on the coil spring serving as a buffer device (spring load), and thereby the coil spring can be set to have a lower spring constant. This makes it possible to obtain enhanced operationality and facilitate downsizing, the reason for which will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) to <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The following comparison between the first embodiment and the conventional example will be made under the common conditions that both of them have the push rod <b>38</b> having a diameter of 2 mm, a water pressure is 0.75 MPa (maximum vale of a tap water pressure), and a force against the sliding frictional resistance of the sealing member <b>54</b> is 0.6 N.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) is a graph showing the relationship between a moving distance (displacement) (mm) of the manual operation member <b>36</b> and an operational force F (N) during the water-stopping operation (during switching from the water-discharge state to the water-stop state) in the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) is a graph showing the relationship between a moving distance (displacement) (mm) of the manual operation member and an operational force F (N) during the water-stopping operation in the conventional example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) is a graph showing the relationship between a moving distance (displacement) (mm) of the manual operation member <b>36</b> and a spring load (N) acting on the coil spring during the water-stopping operation in the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) is a graph showing the relationship between a moving distance (displacement) (mm) of the manual operation member and a spring load (N) acting on the coil spring during the water-stopping operation in the conventional example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In these figures, d<b>0</b> indicates a position where the water-stopping operation is initiated, d<b>1</b> indicates a position where the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, and d<b>2</b> indicates the lowermost position to which the manual operation member <b>36</b> can be moved (displaced) by the pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the first embodiment, the coil spring <b>42</b> is incorporated in the hollow portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the pilot valve <b>40</b> while a very small load (e.g. 0.1 N) is applied thereto during assembling.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Between the position d<b>0</b> and the position d<b>1</b>, or before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, an operational force of 3N (=2.4 N+0.6 N), which is balanced with a resultant of a force received from the above water pressure: 2.4 N (=cross-sectional area of the push rod×the water pressure=3.14 mm<sup>2</sup>×0.75 MPa) and a force against the sliding frictional resistance of the sealing member <b>54</b>: 0.6 N, acts on the push rod <b>38</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>), the operational force is kept at 3 N before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>), before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> (between the position d<b>0</b> and the position d<b>1</b>), no load acts on the coil spring <b>42</b>, or the spring load is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Then, after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, it is required to deflect the coil spring <b>42</b> by an operational force. A spring load acting on the coil spring to deflect it may be an extremely small value (approximately zero) because substantially no load acts on the coil spring <b>42</b> before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>. Thus, in the first embodiment, the spring constant is set at a small value providing a spring load of about 0.4 N at the lowermost position d<b>2</b> to which the manual operation member <b>36</b> can be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">More specifically, after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, or when the moving distance of the manual operation member is changed from d<b>1</b> to d<b>2</b>, the amount of deflection (δ) of the coil spring <b>42</b> is 4 mm. In this case, given that the spring load during assembly is zero, the spring constant of the coil spring <b>42</b> is 0.1 N/mm (=0.4 N/4 mm). Given that the spring load during assembly is 0.1 N, the spring constant of the coil spring <b>42</b> is 0.075 N/mm (=(0.4−0.1)N/4 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the conventional example, the coil spring is disposed outside the pressure chamber. Thus, an operational force of 3N(=2.4 N+0.6 N), which is balanced with a resultant of a force received from the above water pressure: 2.4 N(=cross-sectional area of the push rod×the water pressure=3.14 mm<sup>2</sup>×0.75 MPa) and a force against the sliding frictional resistance of the sealing member <b>54</b>: 0.6 N, initially acts on the coil spring as a spring load. Consequently, the conventional example is required to use a coil spring having a large spring constant capable of generating only an extremely small amount of deflection even if 3.0 N of spring load acts thereon. This value is extremely large as compared to the spring load acting on the coil spring in the first embodiment, which is approximately zero.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the conventional example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>), between the position d<b>0</b> and the position d<b>1</b>, or before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, the operational force of 3N(=2.4 N+0.6 N), which is balanced with the resultant of the force received from the above water pressure: 2.4 N(=cross-sectional area of the push rod×the water pressure=3.14 mm×0.75 MPa) and the force against the sliding frictional resistance of the sealing member <b>54</b>: 0.6 N, acts on the push rod <b>38</b>, as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">However, in the conventional example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>), before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> (between the position d<b>0</b> and the position d<b>1</b>), a spring load equivalent to 3N of operational force already acts on the coil spring.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Then, after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, it is required to deflect the coil spring by an operational force. However, as described above, this coil spring is essentially designed to have a large spring, and thereby a large operational force is required to deflect the coil spring. For example, given that a coil spring having a spring constant of 6 N/mm generating a displacement of 0.5 mm relative to a spring load of 3N is used, and the amount of deflection (δ) of the coil spring for absorbing the moving distance (displacement) of the manual operation member is 4 mm, 24 N of operational force is required.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">A preferable range of the spring constant of the coil spring serving as a buffer device in the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly (switching valve unit) in the first embodiment will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">While the spring constant of the coil spring in the above conventional example has to be set at a large value of 6 N/mm or more due to the buffer device (coil spring) disposed outside the pressure chamber, it is preferable that the spring constant of the coil spring in the first embodiment be set in the range of 0.01 to 2 N/mm. The coil spring having a spring constant set in the above range makes it possible to eliminate the difference (unevenness) in operational force during the water-stopping operation, which would otherwise occur between (1) before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> and (2) after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, so as to obtain a desirable operational feeling, as compared to the conventional example.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, given that an operational force (3N) before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> (between d<b>0</b> to d<b>1</b>) is an initial-stage operational force, if an operational force (spring load) to be added after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> is equal to or less than the initial-stage operational force (3N), the difference (unevenness) in operational force during the water-stopping operation, which would otherwise occur between (1) before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> and (2) after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, can be effectively eliminated to obtain a desirable operational feeling as compared to the conventional example.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In this case, the coil spring may be set to have a spring constant of 0.01 to P<sub>1</sub>d<sup>2</sup>π/(4δ)N/mm, wherein δ is the amount of deflection (mm) of the coil spring, P<sub>1 </sub>is a water pressure (MPa), and d is the diameter (mm) of a rod portion of the push rod member.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">More specifically, given that the diameter of the push rod is 2 mm, the water pressure is 0.75 MPa (maximum value of a tap water pressure) and the amount of deflection of the coil spring <b>42</b> is 4 mm, the spring constant of the coil spring is in the range of 0.01 to 0.75 N/mm(=3 N/4 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Thus, in the first embodiment, the spring constant of the coil spring may be set in the range of 0.01 to 0.75 N/mm. This makes it possible to eliminate the difference (unevenness) in operational force during the water-stopping operation, which would otherwise occur between (1) before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> and (2) after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, so as to obtain an improved desirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The minimum value of the spring constant of the coil spring in the first embodiment is set at 0.01 N/mm based on three required conditions for reducing the spring constant of the coil spring: reducing the diameter of a spring wire rod of the coil spring; reducing the number of turns of the coil spring; and increasing the diameter of the coil spring.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As is clear from the comparison between the first embodiment and the conventional example, the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to the first embodiment allows the spring constant of the coil spring <b>42</b> to be set at a smaller value than that in the conventional valve assembly having the coil spring disposed outside the pressure chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Therefore, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), the difference (unevenness) in operational force during the water-stopping operation, which would otherwise occur between (1) before the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> and (2) after the pilot valve <b>40</b> is brought into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b>, can be eliminated so as to obtain an improved desirable operational feeling.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In addition, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>), the pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to the first embodiment makes it possible to reduce a spring load acting on the coil spring to obtain a desirable operational feeling and facilitate downsizing of the assembly to a large degree as compared to the conventional valve assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, in the conventional valve assemblies in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, if the shower push button <b>10</b> or another push button is strongly pressed so as to rapidly bring the pilot valve <b>40</b> into contact with the pilot-valve port <b>44</b> to close the pilot valve <b>40</b>, a load on a diaphragm of the diaphragm main valve <b>46</b> will be instantaneously increased to cause a problem about deterioration in durability of the diaphragm. In contrast, according to the first embodiment, the spring constant of the coil spring <b>42</b> can be set at a small value to reduce a spring load. Thus, the moving speed of the main valve <b>46</b> can be lowered to prevent the occurrence of an instantaneous large load acting on the main valve so as to provide enhanced durability of the diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described below. A pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to the second embodiment has an extension portion <b>60</b><i>a </i>formed in a top end portion of the assembling nut <b>60</b> in contact with the manual operation member <b>36</b>. This extension portion <b>60</b><i>a </i>substantially precludes water from getting through the clearance between the outer peripheral surface of the manual operation member <b>36</b> and the extension portion <b>60</b><i>a </i>of the assembling nut <b>60</b> to provide an enhanced water-resistant function. This can effectively prevent the occurrence of operational defects or abnormal noises during operation due to the pinching of dusts and/or the attachment of scales, and provides enhanced sanitary conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a third embodiment will be described below. A pilot-controlled switching valve assembly according to the third embodiment is provided with a manual-operation-member cover <b>70</b> for covering the top surface and outer peripheral surface of the manual operation member <b>36</b>. This manual-operation-member cover <b>70</b> is fixed to the outer peripheral surface of the manual operation member <b>36</b> by the assembling nut <b>60</b> and the switching-valve-unit attaching nut <b>34</b> (without the extension portion <b>34</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The manual-operation-member cover <b>70</b> substantially precludes water from getting into the switching valve unit to provide an enhanced water-resistant function. This can effectively prevent the occurrence of operational defects or abnormal noises during operation due to the pinching of dust and/or the attachment of scales, and provides enhanced sanitary conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 18</figref>, respective structures of faucet and shower push buttons of a mixing faucet will be specifically described.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a perspective view showing an assembly of the plate-shaped heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>, the faucet push button <b>8</b> and the shower push button <b>10</b>, which are components of the mixing faucet <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a perspective top plan view showing the assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wherein the shower push button <b>10</b> is pressed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective back view showing the assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective top plan view showing the shower push button <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a perspective back view showing the shower push button <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In these figures, the faucet push button <b>8</b> and the shower push button <b>10</b> have the same structure, and thus the following description will be made regarding only the shower push button <b>10</b> as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 15</figref>, the shower push button <b>10</b> comprises a button operation portion <b>80</b>, an arm portion <b>82</b> allowing the shower push button <b>10</b> to be attached to the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> as a part of the faucet body, and a plate spring portion <b>84</b> serving as a biasing device allowing the shower push button <b>10</b> to be biased toward the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>. The button operation portion <b>80</b>, the arm portion <b>82</b> and the plate spring portion <b>84</b> are integrally formed in a single piece, and made of polypropylene.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Opposite sides of a distal end of the arm portion <b>82</b> are formed, respectively, with a pair of attaching protrusions <b>82</b><i>a. </i>Each of the attaching protrusions <b>82</b><i>a </i>is adapted to be fitted into a corresponding one of concave portions of an attaching flange <b>4</b><i>a </i>formed in the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> so that the arm portion <b>82</b> is attached to the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>. In the state after the assembling, the shower push button <b>10</b> is swingable about the concave portions of the flange <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The plate spring portion <b>84</b> of the shower push button <b>10</b> has a pair of elastically deformable regions <b>84</b><i>a </i>each having a base end joined to the arm portion <b>82</b>, and a pair of engagement regions <b>84</b><i>b </i>each formed at a distal end of the corresponding deformable region <b>84</b><i>a. </i>A joined position <b>84</b><i>c </i>between the plate spring portion <b>84</b> and the arm portion <b>82</b> is set to maximize a distance from the protrusion <b>82</b><i>a </i>of the arm portion <b>82</b> (or at a position close to the button operation portion <b>80</b>). Thus, when the plate spring portion <b>84</b> is pressed on the back surface of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>, a large force acts on the plate spring portion <b>84</b> to facilitate elastic deformation in the deformable regions.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">An operational process of the shower push button <b>10</b> will be described below. The switching valve units <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows only the switching valve unit <b>32</b>) are disposed to be in contact, respectively, with the bottom surfaces of the faucet and shower push buttons <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> of the mixing faucet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the water-stop state (closed state), the manual operation member <b>36</b> of the switching valve unit <b>32</b> has a top portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>in contact with the bottom surface of the shower push button <b>10</b>, and the top portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>is positioned at a height level L<b>0</b> by the pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this height level L<b>0</b> corresponds to a position where the top surface of the shower push button <b>10</b> and the top surface (front surface) of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> have the same height level. The state of the height level L<b>0</b> corresponds to a position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the water-discharge state (open state), the top portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the manual operation member <b>36</b> of the switching valve unit <b>32</b> in contact with the bottom surface of the shower push button <b>10</b> is positioned at a height level L<b>1</b> by the pilot-valve switching/holding mechanism <b>62</b>. This height level L<b>1</b> is higher than the height level L<b>0</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by h<b>1</b>. The state of the height level L<b>1</b> corresponds to a position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref> (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>) are side views showing respective height levels during a user's operation of the shower push button <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>a</i>) shows a position in the water-stop (closed) state, where the top surface of the shower push button <b>10</b> and the top surface (front surface) of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> have the same height level.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In this position, the engagement regions <b>84</b><i>b </i>of the plate spring portion <b>84</b> are in non-contact with or in contact slightly with the back surface of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>. This prevents the plate spring portion <b>84</b> from generating a biasing force in the water-stop state to avoid the occurrence of permanent deformation therein.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a position of the shower push button <b>10</b> during the course of switching from the water-stop state to the water-discharge state after a user presses the shower push button <b>10</b>, or in a transient state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>c</i>) shows a position of the shower push button <b>10</b> after the completion of the water-discharging operation by a user from the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>b</i>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>c</i>), the top surface of the shower push button <b>10</b> is located at a higher position than that of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> by h<b>1</b>. In this position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the shower push button <b>10</b> is pressed toward the back surface of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> to cause an elastic deformation in the deformable regions <b>84</b><i>a </i>of the plate spring portion <b>84</b>, so as to generate a force allowing the shower push button <b>10</b> to be pressed downward toward the switching valve unit.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Thus, when a user perform the water-discharging operation for switching from the water-stop state to the water-discharge state, the shower push button <b>10</b> is pressed downward by the plate spring portion <b>84</b> to prevent the push button itself from being abnormally moved (vibrated).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, one modification of the structure of a faucet push button and a shower push button in a mixing faucet will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, this shower push button <b>10</b> comprises a button operation portion <b>80</b>, a arm portion <b>82</b> allowing the shower push button <b>10</b> to be attached to the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>, and a plate spring portion <b>86</b> allowing the shower push button <b>10</b> to be biased toward the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>, as in the above embodiment. The plate spring portion <b>86</b> in this modification is formed to extend parallel to the arm portion <b>82</b>. The plate spring portion <b>86</b> has a base end <b>86</b><i>a </i>joined to the back surface of the operation portion <b>80</b> and a distal end <b>86</b><i>b </i>pressed onto the back surface of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b>. Further, an elastically deformable region <b>86</b><i>c </i>is formed between the base end <b>86</b><i>a </i>and the distal end <b>86</b><i>b. </i>When the top surface of the shower push button <b>10</b> is located at a higher position than that of the top surface (front surface) of the heat-insulating cover <b>4</b> during the water discharging operation, the shower push button <b>10</b> is pressed downward by the elastically deformed deformable region <b>86</b><i>c </i></p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Thus, when a user performs the water-discharging operation for switching from the water-stop state to the water-discharge state, the shower push button <b>10</b> is pressed downward by the plate spring portion <b>84</b> to prevent the push button itself from being abnormally moved (vibrated).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As mentioned above, the switching valve unit of the present invention can provide a desirable operational feeling without unevenness in operational force, and can facilitate downsizing.</p>
