<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to efficiently handling the packaging of products and, in particular, to an improved system, method, and apparatus for removing the covers from shipping containers of computer disk media.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a typical shipping container or cassette <b>11</b> for holding a plurality of workpieces <b>12</b> (e.g., computer disk media) is shown. The cassette <b>11</b> has a main body <b>13</b> that engages and supports the workpieces <b>12</b> therein. The cassette <b>11</b> has open upper and lower ends that are covered by upper and lower lids or covers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>, respectively. The upper and lower covers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> wrap around the body <b>13</b> to engage each other via interlocking tabs <b>19</b> and flexible clasps <b>21</b>. One paired set of the tabs <b>19</b> and clasps <b>21</b> are located on each end of the cassette <b>11</b>. When the three pieces of cassette <b>11</b> are mounted together (i.e., the body <b>13</b> and two covers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>), the workpieces <b>12</b> located therein are protected from damage during shipping. The tabs <b>19</b> engage small slots in the clasps <b>21</b> to capture the body <b>13</b> therebetween. A small recess <b>23</b> is located between each clasp <b>21</b> and the end wall of the lower cover <b>17</b>. In addition, the cassette <b>11</b> has pockets <b>25</b> located to the left and right of each of the clasps <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The three components that form cassette <b>11</b> are disassembled by bending the two clasps <b>21</b> outward or away from tabs <b>19</b>, and then lifting upper cover <b>15</b> and (optionally) lowering lower cover <b>17</b> away from body <b>13</b>. The workpieces <b>12</b> are then physically exposed while seated in the body <b>13</b> and ready for removal therefrom via the open upper end of the body <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Historically, the covers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> have been manually removed from the body <b>13</b>. However, manual removal of the covers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> on a large volume basis is a probable source of repetitive motion injury to the operators. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts a prior art fixture <b>31</b> for removing the covers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> from body <b>13</b>. This fixture <b>31</b> requires the cassette <b>11</b> to be mounted at a first position <b>33</b> to unlatch the tabs <b>19</b> from the clasps <b>21</b>, and then moved to a second position <b>35</b> to remove the lower cover <b>17</b> from body <b>13</b>. Unfortunately, this prior art design is a potential source of cover breakage (e.g., tabs <b>19</b> and clasps <b>21</b>) and requires multiple hand motions to unlatch the covers before they are removed from the cassettes. Moreover, the end features on fixture <b>31</b> tend to force clasps <b>21</b> to reengage the tabs <b>19</b> and thereby prevent efficient disassembly of the components. Although this solution is workable, an improved solution would be desirable. For example, a reduction in the amount of hand motion would reduce operator fatigue. In addition, means for ensuring that the tab <b>19</b> is bent outward away from clasp <b>21</b> before the lower cover <b>17</b> is removed would prevent breakage of the tab <b>19</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment of a system, method, and apparatus for easily and quickly removing covers from shipping cassettes that are used to ship computer disk media is disclosed. This solution unlatches the covers and separates them from the cassette in a single fixture position with fewer motions and with less breakage. The present invention uses a movable fork to unlatch one end of the top cover from the bottom cover while the cassette is rotated off of the other end of the bottom cover. This action unlatches and separates the two covers to remove the bottom cover from the cassette in one motion. The top cover is then easily lifted off of the bottom cover. The advantage of this tool is that the unlatching and cover removal can be done in one motion on a single fixture position instead of having to move the cassette between two separate positions on a fixture. It also reduces the number of broken covers by ensuring that the covers are unlatched prior to separating and removing them.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To use the tool, the cassette is placed between the side walls, either on top of a pair of guide rails (e.g., for a 95 mm, 84 mm, or 70 mm cassette), or in a slot between the guide rails (e.g., 65 mm cassette). The cassette is moved forward until it contacts the front of the catch and is then rocked down on top of the fork. As the covers move down on the fork, the slope of the fork pulls the top cover forward and unlatches it from the bottom cover. The fork is mounted to a spring-loaded slide, so that the now-unlatched cover and the cassette are slid forward. This slides the bottom cover under the catch. The cassette is then rocked backward over the inner guide rails and the bottom cover is pried off of the cassette. The cassette is pulled off the tool toward the rear and operator catches the loose bottom cover and removes it from the latch on the other end of the cassette. The top cover is then easily lifted off and the contents of the cassette made accessible.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, in view of the following detailed description of the present invention, taken in conjunction with the appended claims and the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-13</figref>, one embodiment of a system, apparatus, and method for removing a cover from a shipping container is disclosed. The apparatus comprises a fixture <b>41</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) having a base <b>43</b> with a longitudinal axis <b>45</b>, a lateral axis <b>47</b> orthogonal to the longitudinal axis <b>45</b>, and a transverse (i.e., vertical) axis <b>49</b> orthogonal to both the longitudinal and lateral axes <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>. A surface <b>50</b> extends in a plane defined by the longitudinal and lateral axes <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>. Side walls <b>51</b> extend transversely (i.e., vertically) from the surface <b>50</b>, and a slot <b>53</b> is defined longitudinally between the side walls <b>51</b> and extends along the surface <b>50</b> for supporting the cassette or shipping container <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, a pivot guide <b>55</b> is mounted to the surface <b>50</b> and extends laterally between the side walls <b>51</b>. The pivot guide <b>55</b> guides the shipping container <b>11</b> and acts as a fulcrum for pivoting of the shipping container <b>11</b> during cover removal. A catch <b>57</b> is mounted to the surface <b>50</b> and is longitudinally spaced apart from the pivot guide <b>55</b>. The catch <b>57</b> has a lip <b>59</b> extending longitudinally that is transversely spaced apart from the surface <b>50</b> to define a slit <b>61</b> for receiving a portion <b>63</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) of the cover (e.g., the bottom cover <b>17</b>). The lip <b>59</b> engages the bottom cover <b>17</b> during its removal from the shipping container <b>11</b> in a longitudinally deeper position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated embodiment, the catch <b>57</b> is mounted adjacent a longitudinal end <b>65</b> of the base <b>43</b> and is laterally centered between the side walls <b>51</b>. The pivot guide <b>55</b> is mounted longitudinally closer to the catch <b>57</b> than to an opposite longitudinal end <b>67</b> of the base <b>43</b>. The pivot guide <b>55</b> has a pivot guide surface <b>69</b> transversely spaced apart from and parallel to the surface <b>50</b>. Rails <b>71</b> extend transversely from the pivot guide surface <b>69</b> parallel to and abutting the side walls <b>51</b>. In one embodiment, the side walls <b>51</b> are taller in the transverse direction than the rails <b>71</b>. A pivot guide slot <b>73</b> is defined longitudinally between the rails <b>71</b> and extends along the pivot guide surface <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fixture <b>41</b> is designed to remove covers from shipping containers <b>11</b> of different sizes. The pivot guide <b>55</b> guides shipping containers of a larger size on top of the rails <b>71</b> but between side walls <b>51</b>, rather than between the rails <b>71</b> (as shown for a small container <b>11</b>). This design improves the guiding and handling of larger containers <b>11</b> when they rest on top of rails <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, a fork <b>75</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 12</figref>) is mounted to the base <b>43</b> adjacent the catch <b>57</b> and extends transversely above the surface <b>50</b> as shown. The fork <b>75</b> is longitudinally movable relative to the base <b>43</b>, the pivot guide <b>55</b>, and the catch <b>57</b> (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>). The fork <b>75</b> engages the covers <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> and moves longitudinally during disassembly of shipping container <b>11</b>. In the embodiment shown, the lips <b>59</b> on the catch <b>57</b> have a central longitudinal recess <b>77</b> for accommodating the fork <b>75</b> and the clasp <b>21</b> on cover <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiment shown, the fork <b>75</b> comprises a pair of tines <b>81</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) extending transversely from the surface <b>50</b>. Each of the tines <b>81</b> has an orthogonal surface <b>83</b> facing the pivot guide <b>55</b> and an inclined surface <b>85</b> opposite the orthogonal surface <b>83</b> that tapers from a maximum longitudinal dimension <b>87</b> adjacent the surface <b>50</b> to a lateral edge <b>89</b> that is transversely spaced apart from the surface <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref>), the shipping container <b>11</b> is placed in the slot <b>53</b> and pivot guide <b>55</b>, pushed longitudinally into contact with the catch <b>57</b>, pivoted transversely about the pivot guide <b>55</b> toward the fork <b>75</b> such that the fork <b>75</b> deflects a portion of the cover from the shipping container (i.e., the fork <b>75</b> separates one of the clasps <b>21</b> from an associated one of the tabs <b>19</b>), pushed longitudinally deeper into the slit <b>61</b> of the catch <b>57</b> to longitudinally move the fork <b>75</b>, and then pulled transversely away from the fork <b>75</b> such that the lip <b>59</b> pulls the lower cover <b>17</b> from body <b>13</b> and top cover <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the shipping container <b>11</b> is pushed longitudinally into contact with the catch <b>57</b>, there is a transverse clearance <b>91</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) between the top edges <b>89</b> of the fork <b>75</b> and a bottom of the clasp <b>21</b>. Prior to longitudinal movement of the fork <b>75</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6-8</figref>), the fork <b>75</b> is longitudinally closer to the pivot guide <b>55</b> than the lip <b>59</b> on the catch <b>57</b>. After longitudinal movement of the fork <b>75</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>), the fork <b>75</b> is longitudinally flush with the lip <b>59</b> on the catch <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the present invention also comprises a method of removing covers from shipping containers of various sizes. One embodiment of the method starts as indicated at step <b>131</b>, and comprises providing a fixture (step <b>133</b>) having a slot, a pivot guide and a catch mounted in the slot, and a fork located between the pivot guide and the catch; placing a shipping container in the slot and on the pivot guide (step <b>135</b>), the shipping container having a cover; pushing the shipping container and cover along the slot such that the pivot guide guides the shipping container into contact with the catch (step <b>137</b>); pivoting one end of the shipping container and the cover about the pivot guide toward the fork (step <b>139</b>); deflecting a portion of the cover from the shipping container with the fork (step <b>141</b>); pushing the shipping container deeper into the catch and displacing the fork toward the catch (step <b>143</b>); and then retaining the cover with the catch by pulling the shipping container away from the cover to remove the cover from the shipping container (step <b>145</b>), before ending as indicated at step <b>147</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An alternate embodiment of the method of the present invention comprises mounting the catch adjacent an end of the fixture and mounting the pivot guide closer to the catch than to an opposite end of the fixture. When the shipping container is of a relatively small size, another alternate embodiment of the method comprises placing the shipping container in a slot formed in the pivot guide between rails. When the shipping container is of a relatively large size, the shipping container is placed on top of the rails. Yet another alternate embodiment of the method comprises forming lips on the catch and a recess therebetween for accommodating the fork and the portion of the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention has several advantages, including the ability to unlatch and remove cassette covers in one motion on a single fixture instead of having to move the cassette between two fixtures mounted on one plate. It also reduces the number of broken covers by ensuring that the covers are unlatched prior to separating and removing them.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the invention has been shown or described in only some of its forms, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that it is not so limited, but is susceptible to various changes without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
