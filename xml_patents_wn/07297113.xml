<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to monitoring data, and in some embodiments may concern assessing the medical condition of a patient. More particularly, some examples of the invention concern using a subcutaneous sensor to measure a characteristic of tissue in a patient, and in some examples may be used to measure tissue pH to detect shock, or to determine if tissue is viable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Improved casualty/patient care is vital to military operational practices, and is also of great importance in many civilian environments. For example, frequently it is important for a medical care provider to be able to quickly and accurately assess the medical condition of a patient in a combat environment, during disaster relief, at an accident scene, during patient transport, in an emergency room, at a hospital, or at any other location during a medical emergency or the general treatment of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Shock is one of the body's biochemical reactions to an injury. The presence of hypoglycemic or hemorrhagic shock, which frequently occurs in combat casualties and accident victims, must be rapidly and accurately assessed, and must be monitored, to ensure the best prognosis, final patient disposition, and maximum survival rates.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Detecting depression of a patient's vital signs (blood pressure, respiration and heart rate), is a known method for detecting shock. This technique may be used in the field and other environments. However, this method is imprecise and is not favored if other methods are available.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Two methods are known that generally have been used for monitoring the shock state of a patient in a hospital environment. In the first method, global blood flow assessments are made by measuring arterial P<sub>a</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>) oxygen delivery to the body. In the second method, arterial blood lactate concentrations and oxygen consumption are measured. Both of these techniques are invasive and hence may negatively impact the patient's health, because they generally require drawing blood with a catheter (perhaps from the stomach), and also require sophisticated equipment, and consequently cannot be used in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Tissue tonometry is a tissue oriented approach to measuring and diagnosing the shock state of a patient. Tissue P(O<sub>2</sub>) levels, tissue P(CO<sub>2</sub>) levels, and tissue pH, have been shown to be reliable estimates of a compensated shock state. However, the use of these approaches has been hampered by the lack of a reliable and noninvasive method of obtaining accurate measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In combat, disaster, and accident scenarios, the extent of injury to a patient may be so severe as to require amputation of gangrenous tissue. Gangrenous tissue is tissue that has died due to lack of blood supply. Dead tissue may also be present on frostbite victims. Generally, the goal of an amputation is to remove all dead tissue. The extent of tissue removal during an amputation may be excessive, because medical personnel lack an accurate means of determining the demarcation between viable and non-viable tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In summary, known methods of measuring the shock state of a patient are inadequate because they are invasive, non-portable, and/or inaccurate. Further, known methods for identifying and monitoring the border between viable and non-viable tissue are not sufficiently accurate to preclude needless amputation of viable tissue. Additionally, there is no known means of monitoring the continued viability of tissue after an amputation.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The nature, objectives, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following detailed description in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">I. Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention generally relates to monitoring data. Some embodiments provide a microvascular technique for measuring a characteristic of tissue in a patient. Some specific examples concern injecting a microprobe in dermal tissue, to quickly and relatively non-invasively measure dermal tissue pH. Although an embodiment for measuring tissue pH is discussed in this introduction, the invention is not limited to this specific illustrative example.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Real-time measurement of dermal tissue pH (the pH of the vascular layer of the skin), can be used to monitor the general onset of shock. Some examples of the invention provide a real-time microsensor system for measuring tissue pH in the vascular layer of skin, and consequently may be used to detect and provide an early warning for the onset of hypoglycemic or hemorrhagic shock. Thus, the microsensor system provides a relatively non-invasive, portable instrument for monitoring the general onset of shock. The microprobe may be implanted in the dermis in almost any location on a human body, including the fingers and toes, which are desirable locations for measuring shock.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The microsensor system may also be used to identify viable tissue, for example before, during, and/or after an amputation or other surgery. One important application is identifying and/or monitoring viable and non-viable tissue in frostbite patients. Another important application is identifying and/or monitoring gangrenous and non-gangrenous tissue. Another application is identifying and/or monitoring non-viable tissue after a patient has been exposed to severe radiation. In circumstance where non-viable tissue must be amputated, a plurality of microprobes could be placed in different locations in patient tissue, to gather information that may be presented as a three dimensional representation of the patient tissue, so that a surgeon can determine precisely which tissue to remove (and also which tissue that possibly may be revived).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The microsensor system could also be used to determine whether there is adequate capillary fill after removing a tourniquet. In another example, the microsensor system could be used to detect and/or monitor indicators of heart blockage (may be indicated by no change after implementation of an intervention) or congestive heart failure. Statistical algorithms may be performed using data gathered over a period of time, to identify trends and other useful information in the data.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As an example, the microsensor system with or without the patient status monitor could be routinely used by medics and corpsmen on the battlefield, and also could be used by surgeons and other personnel at forward medical units. The microsensor system with or without the patient status monitor could also be used in disaster scenarios, and by emergency medical teams. The microsensor system with or without the patient status monitor could be used to assist in establishing patient triage, and generally could result in improved urgent care and increased patient survival rates. The microsensor system and the patient status monitor generally provide enhanced functionality, sensitivity, and accuracy.</p>

<heading id="h-0057" level="1">A. Patient Status Monitor</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Before discussing the hardware and the operation of a microsensor system, below, an embodiment of an apparatus for monitoring data will first be discussed. As a specific example of this apparatus, an apparatus for monitoring patient status will be discussed. With some modifications to the example below, it is understood that “patient” status can in some cases additionally be more generally understood as the status of the system that is being monitored, which may include, for example, a manufacturing environment and the data produced from such for quality control, the stock market or other economic systems, or a population group (which may include plants, bacteria, etc.) being monitored for disease or exposure to agents injurious to their or its health. The apparatus for monitoring patient status may be used in conjunction with, or may be incorporated into, the microsensor system. As an example, the apparatus for monitoring patient status may be embodied by the hardware components and interconnections of the patient status monitor <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The patient status monitor <b>10</b> includes a patient status data processor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One or more data collection devices are coupled to the patient status data processor <b>12</b>, for sensing or otherwise receiving data. As an example, the data collection devices may include one or more medical sign sensors <b>14</b>, one or more medical lab data test sensors <b>16</b>, and/or one or more intervention data collectors <b>18</b>. One or more of the medical sign sensors <b>14</b> may be a microprobe <b>1302</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), or a microprobe system <b>1300</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), (which may gather tissue pH information and possibly other information), and which will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The patient status data processor <b>12</b> may be coupled to one or more output devices, which may include, for example, one or more displays <b>20</b>, one or more printers <b>22</b>, and/or one or more data archives <b>24</b>. Display <b>20</b> may include a visible and/or audible alarm and/or other means to convey an alarm condition. For example, the display may include a speaker or buzzer or other audio transducer for producing an audio alarm. As another example, a visible alarm may be presented on the display, or a LED could be included on the display housing for indicating an alarm. The medical sign sensor <b>14</b> and medical lab data test sensors <b>16</b> sense or otherwise receive information such as, for example the following data types, pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration, body temperature, white blood cell count, iron, cholesterol, triglyceride, blood sugar, tissue pH, and blood gas information for a patient, and output data values representative of the medical signs and lab tests, as data to the patient status data processor <b>12</b>. The intervention data collector <b>18</b> gathers information concerning actions taken to correct problems, upper and lower patient reference values, upper and lower patient threshold values, and other significant actions as well as how long a data type value can remain unchanged before an alarm should sound that an intervention is not working. For example, the intervention data collector <b>18</b> may receive data concerning when medication is administered or when the patient was covered with a blanket. The intervention data may be date/time stamped.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The patient status data processor <b>12</b> may be any type of data processing apparatus, and as an example, may be a microprocessor or computer. The computer may be, for example, a personal computer, personal digital assistant, mainframe computer, computer workstation, supercomputer, or other suitable machine. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the patient status data processor <b>12</b> may include a processor <b>26</b>, such as a microprocessor or other processing machine, which may be coupled to a memory <b>28</b> and a nonvolatile storage <b>30</b>. The memory <b>28</b> may comprise random access memory, and may be used to store programming instructions executed by the processor <b>26</b>. The nonvolatile storage <b>30</b> may comprise, for example, one or more magnetic data storage disks such as a “hard drive,” an optical drive, a tape drive, or any other suitable storage device. The patient status data processor <b>12</b> may also include an input/output <b>32</b>, such as a line, bus, cable, or electromagnetic link, for the data processor <b>12</b> to receive instructions from a user, and may also permit exchanging data with locations external to the patient status data processor <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the memory <b>28</b> and/or the nonvolatile storage <b>30</b> may be eliminated, and further, memory and/or nonvolatile storage may be provided on-board the processor <b>26</b>, or externally to the patient status data processor <b>12</b>.</p>

The exemplary microsensor system <b>1300</b> includes a microprobe <b>1302</b>, a microprobe delivery system <b>1303</b>, a control module <b>1304</b>, and interface <b>1306</b>, which operably couple the microprobe <b>1302</b> to the control module <b>1304</b>. Interface <b>1306</b> may include electrical wires, optical fiber or wireless data and/or power transmission means.</p>
<heading id="h-0059" level="1">B1. Microprobe</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a diagram of the microprobe <b>1302</b> (which may be called a tissue microprobe). The microprobe <b>1302</b> must be small enough to not cause an adverse reaction in the human body, or a reaction that would interfere with obtaining accurate data. The microprobe <b>1302</b> includes a housing <b>1402</b> having an aperture <b>1404</b>. The housing <b>1402</b> may have a tab <b>1403</b> for limiting the extent of incursion of the microprobe <b>1302</b> into the dermis. The microprobe <b>1302</b> also includes an ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) microsensor <b>1406</b>, which is attached to the housing <b>1402</b> (which may also be called an encapsulant). The ISFET <b>1406</b> has a gate <b>1408</b> located proximate the aperture <b>1404</b>, as well as a source and a drain (shown and discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> below). The microprobe <b>1302</b> also includes a reference electrode <b>1410</b> (which may be called a reference microelectrode), which is attached to the housing <b>1402</b> proximate the aperture <b>1404</b>. As an example, the reference electrode <b>1410</b> may be made of silver (Ag), silver chloride (AgCl), Pt, or with functionally equivalent material. At least a portion of the gate <b>1408</b> and at least a portion of the reference electrode <b>1410</b> may be located within the aperture <b>1404</b>. However, depending upon the exact structure of the microprobe <b>1302</b>, especially in its microfabricated form, the housing <b>1402</b> and aperture <b>1404</b> may be only functionally present. Said housing <b>1402</b> may only comprise the substrate upon which all components are fabricated in sequence, such as a sapphire substrate, or an encapsulate layer, which by example might be a thin SiN4 layer, deposited or otherwise formed in regions that without the encapsulate, would not be biocompatible. As an example, the housing and the ISFET may be integrally formed in biocompatible material. As another example, the housing and the reference electrode may be integrally formed in biocompatible material. In some examples, the housing may be made of sapphire. Herein components (for example, the housing, ISFET, reference electrode and/or substrate) that are “attached” may be separate pieces that are secured together, or integrally formed components.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">ISFETs have a structure that is similar to metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), which are commonly used in low power microelectronics. Generally, in field effect transistors, a current flow occurs between source and drain regions, in response to modulation of channel conductivity by the gate region. In a conventional MOSFET, a voltage is applied to a metal gate to perform the modulation. In the case of an ISFET, modulation occurs by changing the surface charge on a bare gate insulator. The surface charge may change in response to the protonization-deprotonization of the gate insulator in the presence of a solution. The protonization-deprotonization is directly related to the pH of the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The reference electrode <b>1410</b> may be used to complete the electrical circuit. Direct measurement of the pH of the solution may be obtained by measuring a shift in the threshold voltage (the onset of source-drain current), or by measuring the source-drain current, of the ISFET. The current flow may be coupled to a display and scaled to provide a pH readout. Thus, in some applications the ISFET may be used to measure the pH of tissue. In some examples, the microprobe could also have a blood gas sensor, which could be a second ISFET, or a single ISFET could be used for sensing blood gas rather than pH. Due to the miniaturization of the microprobe system, a plurality of sensing elements or arrays of elements could be included in the microprobe.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The microprobe <b>1302</b> may also include associated electronics circuitry <b>1412</b> attached to the housing <b>1402</b>. The associated electronic circuitry <b>1412</b> need not be placed in or proximate the aperture <b>1404</b>, and may be protected inside the housing <b>1402</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> a breakaway of the housing <b>1402</b> is indicated to render the associated electronics circuitry <b>1412</b> visible. As an example, the circuitry <b>1412</b> may be a temperature sensing diode or another type of sensor. In another example, the circuitry <b>1412</b> could be logic circuitry, which for example could be a logic array or a microprocessor, which could permit the microprobe <b>1302</b> to perform statistical algorithms and other logical and mathematical operations (thereby operating as a smart sensor). The ISFET <b>1406</b> and the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, and also if desired the associated circuitry <b>1412</b>, may be monolithically integrated. The ISFET <b>1406</b> and the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, and also if desired the associated circuitry <b>1412</b>, may be formed on a substrate <b>1414</b> that is attached to the housing <b>1402</b>. The housing <b>1402</b> may substantially encapsulate and may hermetically seal the substrate <b>1414</b> except for a portion of the substrate <b>1414</b> within the aperture <b>1404</b>, wherein at least a portion of the gate <b>1408</b> and at least a portion of the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, are attached to the substrate <b>1414</b> within the aperture <b>1404</b>. Thus, the housing <b>1402</b> may hermetically seal the ISFET <b>1406</b> and the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, except for portions of the ISFET <b>1406</b>, the reference electrode <b>1410</b> that are within the aperture <b>1404</b>, to permit contact between the components in the aperture <b>1404</b> and the tissue being measured. Accordingly, the microprobe <b>1302</b> defines an exterior space that is exterior to the microprobe <b>1302</b>, wherein at least a portion of the gate <b>1408</b> and at least a portion of the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, are in fluid communication with the exterior space. The microprobe <b>1302</b> may be shaped, for example, as a small needle, as a cylinder, or in any other appropriate shape. The housing <b>1402</b> may be made of any suitable biocompatible material, and as an example, may comprise silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The microprobe <b>1302</b> also has a power/electronic interface <b>1416</b>, for supplying power to the microprobe <b>1302</b>, and for outputting data signals from the microprobe <b>1302</b> to the control module <b>1304</b>. The power/electronic interface may be coupled to the ISFET <b>1406</b>, the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, and the associated circuitry <b>1412</b>. In one example, the power/electronic interface <b>1416</b> is three wires (power, ground, and signal). In other embodiments, one, two, four or more wires could be used. The wires of the power/electronic <b>1416</b> interface may be long enough to connect the microprobe to the control module <b>1304</b>, or may extend only a short distance from the microprobe <b>1302</b>, in which case additional wires may be used to connect the microprobe to the control module <b>1304</b>. Alternatively, the wires of the power/electronic interface <b>1416</b> may only reach to within the microprobe <b>1302</b>, and could be attached to a socket on the microprobe <b>1302</b>, which could be coupled to additional wiring to connect the microprobe <b>1302</b> to the control module <b>1304</b>. Other methods could be used to couple the microprobe <b>1302</b> to the control module <b>1304</b>. For example, the power/electronic interface <b>1416</b> could include a fiber-optic interface (and possibly fiber optic cable), and a fiber-optic link could be connected between the power/electronic interface <b>1416</b> and the control module <b>1304</b>, for transmitting data to the control module <b>1304</b>. In other embodiments, the power/electronic interface <b>1416</b> could include an electromagnetic transmitter (and possibly a receiver), for permitting untethered communications between the microprobe and the control module, and for leaving the patient untethered. For example, the electromagnetic communications could utilize free-space optical, radio-frequency, microwave, or generally any other suitable frequencies of electromagnetic waves. As an example, data signals could be wirelessly transmitted from the microprobe <b>1302</b> to the control module <b>1304</b>. In examples of the microsensor system <b>1300</b> in which a plurality of microprobes <b>1302</b> are simultaneously utilized, untethered communications may be particularly useful for permitting the control module <b>1304</b> to simultaneously monitor the plurality of microprobes <b>1302</b>, without having a large number of wires or fiber optic cables.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The microprobe <b>1302</b> could also include a calibrant <b>1418</b> (material used for calibrating), which could be a liquid, gel, powder, solid, or gas, which is placed in contact with the gate <b>1408</b> of the ISFET <b>1406</b> and with the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, for calibrating and/or testing the microprobe <b>1302</b>. Alternatively, the calibrant could be included as part of the microprobe delivery system <b>1303</b> (discussed below). As an example, the calibrant <b>1418</b> could be a saline solution. The microprobe <b>1302</b> could be tested and/or calibrated, by reading the pH of the saline solution, before the microprobe <b>1302</b> is located in the tissue to be measured. If the microprobe <b>1302</b> being tested outputs erroneous data, the microprobe <b>1302</b> can be discarded, and another microprobe <b>1302</b> can be used. If the microprobe <b>1302</b> contains a plurality of sensing elements, the circuitry <b>1412</b> may employ built-in test algorithms to reconfigure the microprobe <b>1302</b> to utilize correctly functioning sensing elements following calibration.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The ISFET has a source portion <b>1504</b> and a drain <b>1506</b> portion, which may be formed by incorporation of dopants into the silicon layer <b>1902</b>. As an example, boron (p-type) dopants may be incorporated into n-type silicon layer <b>1902</b> by ion implantation and subsequent thermal annealing or similar techniques as practiced in the art of microelectronic fabrication, to form the source portion <b>1504</b> and the drain portion <b>1506</b>. A gate insulator <b>1908</b> may be formed on the silicon layer <b>1902</b> to establish a channel portion <b>1910</b>, which is defined as the predominant region of current flow when the ISFET <b>1406</b> is biased in the on state. The gate insulator <b>1908</b> may be formed in a single step or in a plurality of steps. As an example, the gate insulator <b>1908</b> may be formed by high temperature oxidation of the silicon to form stoichiometric silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). This may be followed by the high temperature deposition of silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) by the pyrolysis of ammonia and dichlorosilane. Contact 1912 provides electrical contact to the source <b>1504</b>, and contact <b>1914</b> provides electrical contact to the drain <b>1506</b>. As an example, the contacts <b>1912</b>, <b>1914</b> may be aluminum or an aluminum alloy, for example 99% Al-1% Si, or may comprise titanium-silicide or other silicides, or other materials used in the art of microelectronic fabrication.

The sequence includes operation <b>2002</b>, which comprises providing a semiconductor wafer, which may for example, be bulk silicon, SOS, SOI, or other suitable material. As an example, a p-type bulk silicon wafer may be used. In operation <b>2004</b>, an n-well region is formed in the semiconductor wafer, to define a semiconductor layer wherein the ISFET microsensor <b>1406</b>, reference electrode <b>1410</b>, and associated circuitry <b>1412</b> are fabricated. As an example, the n-well region may be formed by thermal oxidation, photolithographic patterning, and etching of the oxide. N-type dopants may be added, by using, for example, ion implantation of phosphorous followed by furnace oxidation and thermal treatment to establish the desired well depth (or drive). In the case of SOS, additional operations are employed to form a suitable semiconductor layer as described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

In operation <b>2008</b>, the gate insulator <b>1908</b> may be patterned, if desired, by photolithographic and etching steps known in the art of microfabrication. Patterning and etching the gate insulator <b>1908</b> provides a means for electrical contact with the source <b>1504</b> and drain <b>1506</b> regions (also called portions) that are subsequently formed, and also defines regions used by the associated circuitry (which may be included).</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In carrying out a method embodiment, the patient status data processor <b>12</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may flag points above and below simple normal value thresholds, determine shifts in the mean, and identify outlier and burst points of, for example, a medical sign or a lab test value. The patient status data processor <b>12</b> applies the Dynamic Change point Detection (DCD) algorithm to detect a change in a patient's health state (or a change in a characteristic of tissue), to detect changes toward or away from a patient's reference value range, and to detect when no change has occurred when one should have occurred, and also employs a simple threshold test to flag values outside the patient's threshold value range. If a value is outside the patient's threshold value range or if a change in the patient's health status (or of the tissue) is indicated, then the patient status data processor <b>12</b> may display the status on a display, and/or may print a log of the patient's health status or otherwise activate an alarm status indicator or actuator. The actuator is envisioned to automatically take remedial action in response to said alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The Dynamic Change point Detection algorithm is a type of trend analysis, and is used to study changes that occur in a data set over time. Using the Dynamic Change point Detection algorithm facilitates early detection of changes, which permits intervention before a problem causes irreversible damage. The problem could be a condition that slowly degrades over time or the problem could be a shift in the value of a medical sign or lab test value.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The Dynamic Change point Detection is a process that performs any one or more of the following:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0087">1. Allows the user to exclude data points from the analysis.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0088">2. Allows the user to change the thresholds used by one or more of the following twelve statistics. One or more of these statistics may be used in the DCD detection process. The twelve statistics are: four Shewhart test statistics, two Maximum CUSUM statistics, two Fast Initial Response CUSUM statistics, a statistical method for calculating the mean and standard deviation from the incoming data set, a statistical method for flagging and removing outliers from the mean and standard deviation estimates, a method for comparing the datapoint to a patient reference value, a method for comparing the trend direction to the patient reference value range, a method for determining a change in value is over due, and a method for determining when the mean and standard deviation should be reset and subsequently resetting the mean and standard deviation when appropriate.</li>

<p id="p-0088" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-C</figref> are a flow chart showing a sequence <b>600</b> for monitoring patient status in accordance with an example of a method embodiment. For ease of explanation, but without any intended limitation, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-C</figref> is described in the context of the patient status monitor <b>10</b> and the microsensor system <b>1300</b> described above. As an example, the sequence <b>600</b> may be used for detecting the onset of a disease or a change in the health status of an individual (who may also be called a patient), or for detecting the onset of shock, or for detecting whether tissue may become non-viable.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0104">Although sequence <b>600</b> primarily seems to illustrate a method for monitoring the status of a single medical patient's status, many embodiments of the method aspect of the invention are generally applicable to monitoring data in any type of application. For example, the method for monitoring data could be used in any quality control manufacturing situation where there is a preferred reference range specification, a set of population values associated with the current manufacturing process and a number of interventions that might be done to move a process into the preferred reference range such as producing baked goods, manufacturing parts, and microchip clean room temperature and air quality particulate monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0105">Further examples where the method may be applied include any population medical surveillance situation that includes monitoring the rates of occurrence or counts of grouping of ICD-9 codes, a single ICD-9 code, and/or signs and symptoms where these rates and counts represent the rates or counts of disease or biological exposure, injury, chemical exposure, radiological exposure, nuclear exposure, or other general health related items.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0106">Other examples include any patient medical monitoring situation that includes monitoring signs and symptoms associated with an individual such as pulse rate, oxygenation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, weight, tissue PH, breathing rate, EEG, chemical/horme levels, or any other signs, symptoms, or lab test values.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0107">In other examples the method could also be applied to the stock market to watch the movement of stocks, bonds, treasury notes, money market, etc. movement toward or away from a buy or sell reference range. It could also be applied to the housing market.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0108">The method could also be applied to the monitoring of any economic situation where there is a current value and a reference range such as the State of California's deficit current value, the interventions such as removal of the vehicle tax increase, and the preferred range of little or no deficit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0109">The specific example of the sequence <b>600</b> will now be discussed. The sequence <b>600</b>, which may be performed by the patient status data processor <b>12</b>, may include and may begin with operation <b>602</b>, which comprises initializing process values.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0110">The sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>604</b>, which comprises receiving medical intervention information.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0111">The sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>605</b>, which comprises receiving patient reference values (which may be called patient specific tissue reference values), and patient threshold values (which may be called user input thresholds). As an example, the patient and/or tissue reference values may be determined by the patient's doctor. Upper and lower thresholds may be used in the analysis of the patient's status: Alternatively, or in addition to receiving patient reference values, normal population reference values may be inputted from a library reference table for the sign or lab test data type.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0112">The sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>606</b>, which comprises receiving a data point for a data type. As an example, the data type may be tissue pH. Operation <b>606</b> may also include receiving an identifier of the data type. The data set may represent, for example, medical signs or lab data of an individual. One or more data collection devices <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may provide the data that is input in operation <b>606</b>. The data point may be designated x<sub>1</sub>, and may be from a data set comprised of a time series of x<sub>1</sub>, . . . , x<sub>m</sub>. In this example, “1” is the index of the first data point, and m is a positive integer that represents the number of data points that have been input and received into the process.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0113">The sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>608</b>, which comprises checking validity of the data point. The validity of the data point may be based on user criteria. Data points that are determined to be invalid are removed from further consideration, in operation <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0114">The patient status monitor <b>10</b> collects (or receives) a time ordered set of medical sign, and lab test data and either uses user-specified mean and standard deviation values or determines the mean, and standard deviation from the incoming data. Accordingly, the sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>612</b>, which comprises determining if a baseline mean and baseline standard deviation have been obtained for the data type. If a baseline mean and baseline standard deviation have not been obtained, then operation <b>614</b> is performed, which comprises obtaining a baseline mean and a baseline standard deviation. The user may specify that one or more data points not be used in the analysis, set the number of points used in calculating the mean and standard deviation, and change the threshold settings on the various statistics.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0115">The mean and standard deviation may be calculated from the incoming data. Alternatively, the operation of obtaining a baseline mean and a baseline standard deviation may comprise using population values of the mean and standard deviation. In another alternative, the operation of obtaining a baseline mean and a baseline standard deviation may comprise using preset background values of the mean and standard deviation.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0116">The mean and standard deviation may be derived from the currently available data points x<sub>1</sub>, . . . , x<sub>n </sub>that have been inputted, or may be derived from a baseline data set x<sub>K</sub>, . . . , x<sub>L </sub>identified during a baseline reset. “n” is defined as the current number of data points entered if the baseline mean and standard deviation have not been set, and is the last data point used to create an acceptable baseline mean and standard deviation after the mean and standard deviation are set for the first time. (The letter “m” is sometimes used instead of the letter “n”.) The mean and standard deviation may be, when needed, calculated and reset a number of times. During the operation <b>614</b> of obtaining the baseline mean and standard deviation, non-conforming data points may be identified and removed from the baseline data set. A variable “r” is set equal to the number of data points removed from consideration either a priori by the user or because they are found to be non-conforming data points. When the mean and standard deviation are calculated from the incoming data, four Shewhart tests are used to remove and flag outliers in the mean and standard deviation calculations. A point that is three standard deviations or more from the mean is flagged as a burst point. A point that is between two and three standard deviations from the mean is flagged as an outlier point. Burst and outlier data points are removed from the calculations if their removal does not cause the standard deviation to be zero. The process is continued until the standard deviation is non-zero and at least seven points that meet these criteria are found. The resultant mean and standard deviation are used in the signal detection tests. An adjustment may be made in the non-conforming data point removal when the data is discrete instead of continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0117">In following description of operations performed to obtain a baseline mean and a baseline standard deviation, a first data point received in operation <b>606</b> may be referred to as the first data point, and a second data point received in operation <b>606</b> may be called a second data point. More specifically, the operation <b>614</b> of obtaining a baseline mean and baseline standard deviation may comprise:</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0128">The sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>616</b>, which comprises calculating test statistics. As an example, the operation of calculating test statistics may comprise applying two MAX CUSUM tests (MAXimum CUmulative SUM) to calculate an upper MAX CUSUM value and a lower MAX CUSUM value, and/or applying two FIR MAX CUSUM tests (Fast Initial Response CUmulative SUM) to calculate an upper FIR MAX CUSUM value and a lower FIR MAX CUSUM value, and/or performing four Shewhart statistical tests, and/or calculating an approximate standard score, and/or calculating signal length, and/or calculating signal amplitude or shift. The Dynamic Change point Detection processor may apply small sample versions of the statistical tests. The statistical tests are conducted on the data to detect changes in the patient's health state. If a change in a patient's sign or lab test data is indicated, then the patient's sign or lab test data health status statistics may be presented on a display.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0129">Statistical methods used for medical monitoring may be categorized in two different categories. The first category includes statistical methods that are concerned with detecting sharp changes which are stark departures from historic levels, and that often, rapidly, return to the norm, and which are called a burst or outlier. Moving average charts and proportion charts are examples of the first type of statistical method. The second category includes statistical methods that are concerned with smaller deviations from historic levels that are sustained over an extended period of time, and which are known as a shift or trend. Linear regression and Cumulative Sums (CUSUM) are examples of the second type of statistic. Additionally, two-state Markov statistics such as the CUSUM statistic are useful for detecting shifts and trends in data, and can provide an estimate of the beginning and end of a signal. Four small-sample two-state Markov statistics may be used to detect trends and shifts in the data and to determine the beginning and end of a signal. The detection and removal of normal cyclic variation could be added to these algorithms to remove artifacts that may produce false alarms and therefore improve the detection of clinically significant events. Alternative embodiments could also include operations for forecasting the value of the data type for some time in the future using methods known to the art such as polynomial regression line fit. Additionally, alternative embodiments could include operations for reconstructing the signal present in data points (such as data points K through L discussed below).</p>

where L and k are chosen to maximize S<sub>m</sub>. A change in Markov state from F to G occurs when S<sub>m </sub>is greater than H where H is a constant chosen such that the reciprocal of the average run length equals the desired probability of false alarm. The probability of a false alarm is approximately 0.05 for the two-state Markov process implemented. In the implemented process, a change in Markov state from G to F is assumed to have occurred when S<sub>m+1</sub>,S<sub>m+2</sub>, and S<sub>m+3 </sub>are less than S<sub>m</sub>.

As an example, μ<sub>2</sub>/(2σ) may be set to 0.5. The FIR implementation of the MAX CUSUM may be used to determine when a perceived state change is statistically significant. The MAX CUSUM implementation may be used to estimate the number of data points belonging to the second state G.
</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0154">The length of the second state may be estimated as follows: an estimate of L is the index of the maximum S<sub>j </sub>value. To estimate k the process looks backwards in time from {circumflex over (L)} for the most recent S<sub>j </sub>value equal to zero. The associated index is an estimate of k. Therefore the estimated signal duration is {circumflex over (L)}−{circumflex over (k)} data points.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0155">To reconstruct the signal belonging to the second state G, a polynomial regression curve may be used to fit the data points from {circumflex over (k)}+1 to {circumflex over (L)}. Models that determine when a change in a value is non-critical, such as the change in the systolic blood pressure when the patient sits up or rolls over in bed, could be added.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0156">Data points where the upper or lower MAX CUSUM value is greater than zero may be marked yellow, and points where the upper or lower FIR MAX CUSUM value is greater than H may be marked red (for example, on a Dynamic Change point Detection graph).</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0181">Generally, there are four potential reset conditions that may be implemented. Conditions applied are dependent on the initialization by the end-user.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0182">Condition 1: If the signal is statistically significant, and contains enough data points to try a baseline reset, and the signal change direction is toward the normal range, then the baseline should be reset and the information that the mean value has moved toward the normal range is captured. Condition 1 may occur because the initial data points used in calculating the mean and standard deviation contained a signal and was not noise only data. Condition 1 may also indicate an improvement in the patient's status. For example a patient's drop in mean diastolic value from 105 to 100, which is still high, is an improved mean. If this is the case, it would be desirable to monitor for a continued decreased in diastolic value.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0183">Condition 2: If the signal is statistically significant, and contains enough data points to try a baseline reset, and the signal change direction is increasing and farther away from the normal range, then the baseline should be reset and the information that the mean value has increased and is farther away from the normal range is captured.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0184">Condition 3: If the signal is statistically significant, and contains enough data points to try a baseline reset, and the signal change direction is decreasing and farther away from the normal range, then the baseline should be reset and the information that the mean value has decreased and moved farther away from the normal range is captured.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0185">Condition 4: If the signal is statistically significant, and contains enough data points to try a baseline reset, and the signal change is still within the normal range, then the baseline should be reset and the information that the mean value has moved within the normal range is captured.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0186">In alternative embodiments an additional set of four conditions could be used based on user input patient reference thresholds for the sign or lab test values.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0187">The sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>658</b>, which comprises storing the results for an i-window length of data points. The processing window length may be set to a constant, for example 30, during the initialization operation <b>602</b>. Additionally, the sequence <b>600</b> may include operation <b>660</b>, which comprises writing data to an output buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0188">The sequence <b>600</b> may also include operation <b>662</b>, which comprises generating a data output signal that represents a statistically significant change in the patient (or tissue) status. The operation of generating a data output signal may comprise outputting results, for an i-window length of data points that includes the data point, wherein the outputted results may include any of the following, all of the following, or any combination of the following: (1) a time-line event report that includes at least some of the medical intervention information, (2) a Dynamic Change point Detection graph, and (3) a time sequenced table (also called a trend analysis report) containing statistical information. The time sequenced table includes at least some information contained in the time-line display, the threshold test graph, and the Dynamic Change point Detection graph. The time-line event report, the Dynamic Change point Detection graph, and the time sequenced table containing statistical information, may be displayed simultaneously on a single display. The outputting operation may further comprise outputting a threshold test graph. The outputted results may be displayed on one or more display devices such as a computer display screen or other type of video monitor (including a web browser), may be printed on a printer, stored in a data archive, copied to a computer program (such as a word processor or presentation program), and/or emailed.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of a time-line event graph (or report) <b>700</b>. The time line event analysis (time line graph) is a one dimensional x-axis graph that includes information gathered by the sign sensor <b>14</b>, the lab test sensor <b>16</b>, and/or the intervention data collector <b>18</b>. Time may be indicated in days, and medical interventions such as changes in medication or treatment plan, along with medical signs and/or lab test results, may be shown in text windows along the x-axis. The user may be permitted to add additional comments to these text windows. The text shown on the time line may be limited in length. A further explanatory text field of information for each item may be made available through a hyperlink. The text associated with the time line graph may be added to the patient's treatment record. The time-line graph may be presented simultaneously with a color coded Dynamic Change point Detection graph, thereby providing an attending medical physician an easy to read record of the patient's current and past status, along with what corrective actions have been taken. Using the time line graph in conjunction with the Dynamic Change point Detection graph is particularly useful, because medical data monitoring entails more than merely determining when the medical data change is statistically significant, and it requires understanding the clinical significance of the medical data changes.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0190"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of a Dynamic Change point Detection graph <b>800</b>. The Dynamic Change point Detection graph (data trend analysis graph) displays information that includes the results from the DCD algorithm. The graph may indicate a sign or lab test value or counts or rates of occurrence of an event on a Y-axis and days on a X-axis. In one embodiment, the graph is color-coded. For example, a black bar may indicate data points that are three or more standard deviations from the mean.

<p id="p-0194" num="0209">To summarize, an example of one embodiment is a windowed adaptive recursive method for monitoring patient status, and tissue status, by detecting non-conforming data, shifts, and trends in medical sign and lab data, capturing information on medical interventions, comparing the results to the normal value range and/or to a user specified patient reference range, and displaying the results. One embodiment may be described as a windowed adaptive recursive method for monitoring patient status, and tissue status, comprising the steps of: initializing the process; receiving information on medical interventions and medical sign and lab data; detecting changes in incoming medical sign and lab data, calculating a mean and standard deviation if needed from the incoming data or from a baseline data set identified for use in the calculation and identifying and removing non-conforming data points from the data set, calculating various test statistics, testing to determine if the last entered data point is non-conforming, determining the direction of any signal present, determining if any trends and shifts in the data set are statistically significant, determining if detected shifts and trends are toward or away from a reference range, determining if a no change condition has lasted too long, resetting the baseline data set, detecting medical sign data points above or below a normal value threshold, marking the data point above the normal range, within the normal range, and below the normal range, and storing and displaying the data and results for the last window of data points and medical interventions.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0210">Many embodiments give medical caregivers immediate feedback regarding the status of a patient, and facilitate rapid implementation of interventions based on causal relationships between current treatments and medical sign and lab test changes. In view of the practice of transporting less stable patients in combat environments to hospitals in rear echelons, the rapid response facilitated by improved patient monitoring is beneficial because of the greater risk that a patient's condition will change during transport. Also, constraints on medical resources during transit make rapid responses to changes in a patient's condition imperative. Further, a pre-specified integration time or a constant data rate is not required. Therefore, data from unscheduled patient visits and random measurements taken during combat evacuations can be used, rather than requiring measurements to be taken according to a predetermined pattern. Because the methods and algorithms used for implementing various embodiments may be used with low data rates, these embodiments are particularly useful with the limited amounts of data encountered in combat casualty care and ambulatory patient care settings. Various embodiments could also be beneficially utilized for monitoring patients in a critical care facility.</p>

<heading id="h-0070" level="1">B2. Overall Sequence of Operation of Microsensor System</heading>
<p id="p-0197" num="0212">An example of a method embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-B</figref>, which show a sequence <b>2100</b> for a method for measuring and/or monitoring one or more characteristics of tissue. As an example, the characteristic may be tissue pH. Additionally or alternatively, the characteristic could be blood gas. Additionally, the temperature of the tissue could also be measured. For ease of explanation, but without any intended limitation, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-B</figref> is described in the context of the microsensor system <b>1300</b> described above. The sequence <b>2100</b> may begin with operation <b>2102</b>, which comprises providing the microsensor system <b>1300</b>. The sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2104</b>, which comprises opening a package containing the sterile microprobe <b>1302</b> and delivery system <b>1303</b>, <b>1702</b> and removing the sterile microprobe <b>1302</b> and delivery system <b>1303</b>, <b>1702</b> for subsequent use. The sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2106</b>, which comprises operationally coupling the control module <b>1304</b> to the microprobe <b>1302</b>, for example with electrical wiring. The sequence <b>2100</b>, may also include operation <b>2108</b>, which comprises placing a calibrant in contact with the gate <b>1408</b> of the ISFET <b>1406</b> and with the reference electrode <b>1410</b> of the microprobe <b>1302</b>. Calibration/testing of the microprobe <b>1302</b> is performed while the microprobe <b>1302</b> is in contact with the calibrant <b>1418</b> (which may be positioned within the microprobe delivery system <b>1303</b>, <b>1702</b>). The sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2110</b>, which comprises measuring the current flow between the source and the drain of the ISFET, as part of the calibration procedure. As part of the calibration/testing of the microprobe <b>1302</b>, the sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2112</b>, which comprises determining if the current flow is in an acceptable range. If the current flow is not in an acceptable range, in operation <b>2113</b> the microprobe <b>1302</b> may be discarded and replaced with another microprobe <b>1302</b>, and the process may resume at operation <b>2106</b>. Built-in test algorithms may also be employed to reconfigure microprobe <b>1302</b> as noted previously.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0213">Sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2114</b> which comprises positioning the gate <b>1408</b> of the ISFET <b>1406</b>, and the reference electrode <b>1410</b>, in tissue of interest (or in contact with, or in fluid communication with the tissue of interest). As an example, operation <b>2114</b> may be accomplished by positioning the microprobe <b>1302</b> in the tissue of interest by actuating an actuator <b>1602</b>, <b>1704</b> in a microprobe delivery system <b>1303</b>, <b>1702</b>. As an example, the tissue of interest may be skin (which may be in a casualty patient). As an example, the microsensor (or microsensors) <b>1302</b> may be positioned in the dermis in fingers or toes, which is a useful location for monitoring shock. Alternatively, a microsensor (or microsensors) <b>1302</b> could be positioned near the heart to detect heart blockage or congestive heart failure. The microprobe <b>1302</b> may be positioned in the dermis generally anywhere on a patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0214">The sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2116</b>, which comprises measuring the current flow between the source <b>1504</b> and the drain <b>1506</b> of the ISFET <b>1406</b>. The sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2118</b>, which comprises sending a representation of the current flow to the control module <b>1304</b>. Although a single reading is useful, repeated or continuous monitoring permits performing additional analysis, and permits applying statistical techniques on the data, such as the DCD process discussed above and in the related applications referenced above. Although a single reading from a microprobe <b>1302</b> that quickly fails would be useful, a functioning microprobe <b>1302</b> could be left in the dermis for a long period of time, for example several days, during which data could be gathered. The microsensor system <b>1300</b> may be utilized to provide constant real time information during a medical procedure such as an amputation. In other applications, the microsensor system <b>1300</b> may be used to periodically monitor the condition of a patient (for example while warming a patient).</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0215">The sequence <b>2100</b> may further include operation <b>2120</b>, which comprises outputting results, which may include a representation of the pH of the tissue (and possibly other information concerning the tissue and analysis of the data). The results could also include any of the output discussed above with reference to the patient status monitor <b>10</b>. As an example, if multiple microprobes <b>1302</b> are simultaneously utilized and monitored by the control module <b>1304</b>, the results may include a three dimensional representation of the pH of the tissue (and possibly other characteristics of the tissue, such as temperature and/or blood gas levels and/or blood flow information). In a specific example, if multiple microprobes <b>1302</b> are positioned in a patient's hand, the results could include a three dimensional display of the hand showing characteristics of the dermis of the hand where the microprobes <b>1302</b> are located, and may also display an alert status on the three dimension display. In some examples a volumetric, holographic, stereoscopic or virtual three dimensional display could be employed and manipulated by the user for alternative views.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0216">Thus, whether a single microprobe <b>1302</b> or multiple microprobes <b>1302</b> are monitored, after the microprobe (or microprobes) <b>1302</b> is appropriately positioned within the desired tissue, for example using microprobe delivery system <b>1303</b>, <b>1702</b>, tissue pH and/or temperature, as well as, trends, shifts, variance and trends in the variance, of the pH and/or temperature, and/or a trauma score, may be measured, computed, and displayed on the display <b>1812</b> of the control module <b>1304</b>. To perform the analysis of the data received from the microprobe <b>1302</b> (or from multiple microprobes <b>1302</b>), the control module <b>1304</b> may perform calculations described above with regard to the patient status monitor <b>10</b>, and/or described in the related applications referenced above, and/or described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,671,734, issued Sep. 30, 1997, titled “Automatic Medical Sign Monitor”, which is incorporated herein by reference. The control module <b>1304</b> may also provide an estimate of the probability of the onset of shock and/or death. For example within a user specified period of time based on the application of survival analysis on raw data and/or a trauma score. Depending on the particular hardware arrangement, the calculations and analysis may be performed by the control module <b>1304</b>, or by the patient status data processor <b>12</b>, or by the control module <b>1304</b> in conjunction with the patient status data processor <b>12</b>. The sequence <b>2100</b> may also include operation <b>2122</b>, which comprises removing the microprobe (or microprobes) <b>1302</b> from the tissue, and disposing of the microprobe <b>1302</b> using an acceptable medical waste disposal technique.</p>
