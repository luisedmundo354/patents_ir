<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including,” “comprising,” or “having” and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. Unless specified or limited otherwise, the terms “mounted,” “connected,” “supported,” and “coupled” and variations thereof are used broadly and encompass both direct and indirect mountings, connections, supports, and couplings. Further, “connected” and “coupled” are not restricted to physical or mechanical connections or couplings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a single-cylinder, four-cycle, vertical-shaft internal combustion engine <b>10</b>. A vertical-shaft engine is one in which the crankshaft is oriented vertically and the piston is oriented horizontally in the typical operating position of the engine. The most typical application for an engine of this type is powering a lawnmower, but it could be adapted for any situation in which a vertically oriented crankshaft is required. For example, the engine could be used to power other lawn and garden equipment, outdoor power equipment, augers, cultivators, a pump of a pressure washer or to power a generator.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The engine <b>10</b> includes an engine housing <b>12</b>, a fuel tank <b>14</b>, a muffler <b>16</b>, a pull-start mechanism <b>18</b>, and an oil dipstick <b>20</b>. The engine housing <b>12</b> defines a crank chamber <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which is adapted to at least partially rotatably support a crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> defines and is adapted to rotate about a crank axis <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a side view of the engine <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a section view of the engine <b>10</b> taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A cylinder <b>27</b> is defined by the engine housing <b>12</b> and includes a cylinder bore <b>28</b> adapted to slidably receive a piston <b>30</b> for reciprocation. The piston <b>30</b> includes a wrist pin <b>32</b>, which is rotatably connected to a first end of a connecting rod <b>34</b>. A second end of the connecting rod <b>34</b> is rotatably supported by a crank pin <b>36</b>. Also visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a crankshaft counterweight <b>38</b> rigidly affixed to the crank pin <b>36</b>, and a lubricant splasher <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a section view of the engine <b>10</b> taken along line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrating the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> rotatably supported in the engine housing <b>12</b> by bearings <b>42</b> journaled on either end of the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b>. The crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> includes a first shaft portion <b>44</b> and a second shaft portion <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded view of the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b>. The crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> includes the two bearings <b>42</b>, the lubricant splasher <b>40</b>, which is journaled on the first shaft portion <b>44</b>, two counterweights <b>38</b>, one of which is journaled on the first shaft portion <b>44</b>, the other of which is journaled on the second shaft portion <b>46</b>, the crank pin <b>36</b>, the connecting rod <b>34</b>, and a bevel gear <b>48</b>. The first and second shaft portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> define the crank axis <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first shaft portion <b>44</b> has four distinct profiles along its length. The first profile <b>50</b> has a “D” shape, meaning it is cylindrical except for a planar portion truncating the cylindrical circumference. The second profile <b>52</b> is also “D” shaped, but has a larger diameter than the first profile <b>50</b>. A “D” shaped profile on a shaft allows for other components with a matching profile to be journaled on the shaft in only one orientation, and also resists rotation of the component with respect to the shaft. The third and fourth profiles <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are cylindrical, the third profile <b>54</b> having a larger diameter than the fourth profile <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second shaft portion <b>46</b> has five distinct profiles. The first profile <b>58</b> is “D” shaped and is preferably substantially identical to the first profile <b>50</b> of the first shaft portion <b>44</b>. The second profile <b>60</b> is cylindrical, and is preferably substantially identical to the fourth profile <b>64</b>. The third profile <b>62</b> is cylindrical, and has a larger diameter than the second profile <b>60</b>. The fifth profile <b>66</b> has a generally conical shape with a groove parallel to the crank axis <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The lubricant splasher <b>40</b> is journaled on the second profile <b>52</b> of the first shaft portion <b>44</b> for rotation with the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> about the crank axis <b>26</b>. The splasher <b>40</b> includes a substantially cylindrical inner shell <b>68</b> disposed on the first shaft portion <b>44</b>, and an outer cylindrical shell <b>70</b> coupled to the inner shell <b>68</b> by a plurality of ribs <b>72</b>. The inner shell <b>68</b> has a non-circular inner profile substantially identical to the second profile <b>52</b> of the first shaft portion <b>44</b>. The splasher <b>40</b> also includes a plurality of paddles <b>74</b> disposed about its outer shell <b>70</b>. Each of the paddles <b>74</b> includes first and second adjacent faces <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> oriented at angles α, β from the crank axis <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The first face <b>76</b> is oriented at the included angle α from the crank axis <b>26</b>. The second face <b>78</b> is oriented at the smaller included angle β from the crank axis <b>26</b>. During rotation of the splasher <b>40</b> under normal operating conditions, the first face <b>76</b> of each paddle <b>74</b> splashes lubricant radially away from the crank axis <b>26</b>, and the second face <b>78</b> splashes lubricant axially in the direction of the crank axis <b>78</b>. It should be noted that the number of paddles <b>74</b> can vary for other embodiments. Although three paddles <b>74</b> are shown in the figures, this is for illustrative purposes only. The splasher <b>40</b> is a single piece of injection-molded plastic that can be molded from nylon or other polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each counterweight <b>38</b> includes a central aperture <b>80</b> that has a profile identical to the first profile <b>50</b>, <b>58</b> of the first and second shaft portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. The first counterweight <b>38</b> is journaled on the first profile <b>50</b> of the first shaft portion <b>44</b> and the second counterweight <b>38</b> is journaled on the first profile <b>58</b> of the second shaft portion <b>46</b>. Each counterweight <b>38</b> has an aperture <b>82</b> near one end adapted to receive the crank pin <b>36</b>, which connects the two counterweights <b>38</b>. The counterweights <b>38</b> include a pair of symmetrical extended portions <b>84</b> with a gap <b>86</b> between them. Each of the extended portions <b>84</b> has a ramped face <b>88</b> disposed at an angle γ from the crank axis <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The primary function of the counterweights <b>38</b> is to balance forces imposed on the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> from the reciprocating action of the piston <b>30</b>. Additionally, the gap <b>86</b> between the extended portions <b>84</b> of the counterweights <b>38</b> allows lubricant splashed in the axial direction to land on the bevel gear <b>48</b> and the bearing <b>42</b> journaled on the second shaft portion <b>46</b>. To enhance this feature, the gap <b>86</b> is aligned with a paddle <b>74</b> on the splasher <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to promote splashing of lubricant in the axial direction through the gap <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bevel gear <b>48</b> is journaled on the third profile <b>62</b> of the second shaft portion <b>46</b>. The bevel gear <b>48</b> matches a bevel gear disposed on a cam shaft (not shown). The cam shaft is rotatably supported by the engine housing <b>12</b>, and defines a cam axis about which it rotates. The cam axis is oriented normal to the crank axis <b>26</b>, and the cam shaft is rotatably driven by the bevel gear <b>48</b> on the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a side view of the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b>, focusing on the lubricant splasher <b>40</b> and one counterweight <b>38</b>. The drawing illustrates the angle α of the first face <b>76</b> of each paddle <b>74</b> is approximately 55 degrees from the crank axis <b>26</b>, while the angle β of the second face <b>78</b> is approximately 15 degrees from the crank axis <b>26</b>. The drawing also illustrates the ramped surface <b>88</b> of the counterweight extended portions <b>84</b>. The angle γ of the ramped surface <b>88</b> is approximately 55 degrees from the crank axis <b>26</b>. Angles α and γ are independent, and do not necessarily need to be similar angles. It should be noted angles α and γ may range from approximately 45 degrees to 65 degrees, and angle β may range from approximately 5 degrees to 25 degrees, and still permit the splasher to serve the same function.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The splasher <b>40</b> will function properly while the engine <b>10</b> operates at engine speeds ranging from about 3200 to 8500 rpm. The splasher <b>40</b> will also function properly while the vertically oriented crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> is continuously tilted up to 25 degrees and intermittently tilted to 30 degrees from vertical. For the splasher <b>40</b> to effectively splash lubricant to the bearings <b>42</b> and bevel gear <b>48</b>, at least 5 percent of the splasher <b>40</b> must be in contact with the lubricant stored in the crank chamber <b>22</b> even if the engine <b>10</b> is operating while tilted as stated earlier. This is accomplished by storing a volume of lubricant ranging from 40 to 100 cubic centimeters in the crank chamber <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a section view of the crankshaft assembly <b>24</b> viewed along the crank axis <b>26</b>. The section is taken about the crank pin <b>36</b>. It is visible from this perspective how the gap <b>86</b> between the extended portions <b>84</b> of the counterweight <b>38</b> allows splashed lubricant to travel in the axial direction with less interference from the counterweight <b>38</b>. It is also visible how the ramped portions <b>88</b> of the counterweight <b>38</b> help direct the splashed lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a new and useful crank shaft assembly for a four-cycle, vertical-shaft engine. More particularly, the invention provides a new and useful crank shaft assembly that includes a lubricant splasher and counterweights including symmetrical extended portions that operate together to allow lubricant to be splashed to critical lubrication points in the crank chamber. Various features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the following claims.</p>
